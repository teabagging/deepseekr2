I know the total rainfall for the two weeks is 25 inches, and the rainfall during the second week is 15 inches.By subtracting the second week's rainfall from the total, I can find the first week's rainfall:25 inches (total) - 15 inches (second week) = 10 inches (first week).Now that I have both weeks' rainfall amounts, I can calculate the ratio of the second week's rainfall to the first week's rainfall. This is done by dividing the second week's rainfall by the first week's rainfall:15 inches / 10 inches = 1.5.To express this as a ratio, I can write it as 3:2, since 1.5 is equivalent to 3/2."},{"question":"Prove that there is a function  f  from the set of all natural numbers to itself such that for any natural number  n ,  f(f(n)) = n^2 .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to prove that there's a function ( f ) from the set of all natural numbers to itself such that for any natural number ( n ), ( f(f(n)) = n^2 ). Hmm, that sounds interesting. I need to figure out how to define such a function ( f ). First, let me understand what the problem is asking. I need a function that, when applied twice, gives me the square of the original number. So, if I take any natural number ( n ), apply ( f ) to it, and then apply ( f ) again to the result, I should get ( n^2 ). I guess one way to approach this is to think about how functions can be composed. Since applying ( f ) twice gives me ( n^2 ), maybe I can define ( f ) in such a way that it somehow relates to squaring, but not directly. Maybe I can partition the natural numbers into some kind of sequences or cycles where applying ( f ) moves me along the sequence, and applying it twice gets me to the square.Let me try to think of an example. Suppose I start with the number 2. If I apply ( f ) to 2, I get some number, say 3. Then, applying ( f ) to 3 should give me ( 2^2 = 4 ). So, ( f(2) = 3 ) and ( f(3) = 4 ). Now, applying ( f ) to 4 should give me ( 3^2 = 9 ), so ( f(4) = 9 ). Then, ( f(9) ) should be ( 4^2 = 16 ), and so on. This seems to create a chain: 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 9 ‚Üí 16 ‚Üí 81 ‚Üí ... Okay, so this chain works for 2, 3, 4, 9, 16, etc. But what about other numbers? For example, what happens to 5? If I follow the same pattern, I need to define ( f(5) ) such that ( f(f(5)) = 25 ). Maybe I can pair 5 with another number, say 6. So, ( f(5) = 6 ) and ( f(6) = 25 ). Then, ( f(25) = 36 ) because ( f(f(6)) = 6^2 = 36 ), and ( f(36) = 625 ) since ( f(f(25)) = 25^2 = 625 ), and so on. This seems to work for 5 and 6 as well. So, it looks like I can create pairs of numbers where each pair starts a new chain. For each pair ( (p, q) ), I define ( f(p) = q ) and ( f(q) = p^2 ). Then, ( f(f(p)) = f(q) = p^2 ), which satisfies the condition. Similarly, ( f(f(q)) = f(p^2) ). Wait, I need to make sure that ( f(p^2) ) is defined properly. If I follow the same pattern, ( f(p^2) ) should be ( q^2 ), because ( f(f(q)) = q^2 ). So, ( f(p^2) = q^2 ). Then, ( f(q^2) ) should be ( (p^2)^2 = p^4 ), and so on. This creates an infinite chain for each starting pair ( (p, q) ). But how do I ensure that every natural number is included in some chain? I need to make sure that the function ( f ) is defined for all natural numbers, not just some of them. So, I need to partition the natural numbers into these chains in such a way that every number is part of exactly one chain. One way to do this is to start with the smallest unused number and pair it with the next smallest unused number, then define the chains accordingly. For example, start with 2 and 3, then 5 and 6, then 7 and 8, and so on. This way, every natural number is eventually included in a chain, and the function ( f ) is well-defined for all natural numbers. Let me test this idea with a few more numbers to see if it holds. Take 7 and 8. Define ( f(7) = 8 ) and ( f(8) = 49 ) (since ( 7^2 = 49 )). Then, ( f(49) = 64 ) (since ( 8^2 = 64 )), and ( f(64) = 49^2 = 2401 ), and so on. This seems to work. What about 1? Hmm, 1 is a special case because ( 1^2 = 1 ). So, if I apply ( f ) twice to 1, I should get 1. That means ( f(f(1)) = 1 ). So, ( f(1) ) must be a number that maps back to 1 when ( f ) is applied again. Let's say ( f(1) = 1 ). Then, ( f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1 ), which satisfies the condition. Alternatively, I could pair 1 with another number, but since 1 squared is itself, it's simpler to have ( f(1) = 1 ). So, putting it all together, the function ( f ) can be defined as follows:- For ( n = 1 ), ( f(1) = 1 ).- For each pair of consecutive unused natural numbers ( p ) and ( q ), define ( f(p) = q ) and ( f(q) = p^2 ). Then, continue the chain by defining ( f(p^2) = q^2 ), ( f(q^2) = p^4 ), and so on.This way, every natural number is included in exactly one chain, and applying ( f ) twice to any number ( n ) gives ( n^2 ). I think this construction works, but I need to make sure there are no overlaps or gaps. Since I'm pairing numbers sequentially and defining the chains accordingly, every number should be covered without repetition. Also, since the chains are infinite, there's no issue with running out of numbers. Another thing to consider is whether this function is well-defined. For each ( n ), there's a unique ( f(n) ) based on its position in the chain. There's no ambiguity because each number belongs to only one chain. In summary, by constructing chains of natural numbers where each chain starts with a pair ( (p, q) ) and follows the rule ( f(p) = q ), ( f(q) = p^2 ), ( f(p^2) = q^2 ), etc., we can define a function ( f ) such that ( f(f(n)) = n^2 ) for all natural numbers ( n ). This ensures that the function ( f ) satisfies the given condition for all natural numbers."},{"question":"Given that 2 times 10^{10} + a (where 0 leq a < 11) is divisible by 11, the value of the real number a is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of 'a' such that the number 2 times 10 to the power of 10 plus 'a' is divisible by 11. The condition is that 'a' is a real number and it's between 0 and 11, including 0 but not reaching 11. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that there's a rule for checking if a number is divisible by 11. It involves alternating sums of the digits. But wait, in this case, the number isn't given directly; it's given in terms of 10^10, which is a pretty big number. Maybe I can use modular arithmetic instead? I think that might be a better approach here.So, if 2 √ó 10^10 + a is divisible by 11, that means when we divide this number by 11, the remainder should be zero. In modular terms, that would mean:2 √ó 10^10 + a ‚â° 0 mod 11Which implies:a ‚â° -2 √ó 10^10 mod 11But since we're dealing with mod 11, I can simplify 10^10 mod 11 first. Maybe that will make things easier.I recall that 10 mod 11 is just 10, right? So, 10^1 mod 11 is 10. Then, 10^2 mod 11 would be (10 √ó 10) mod 11, which is 100 mod 11. Let me calculate that: 11 √ó 9 = 99, so 100 - 99 = 1. So, 10^2 mod 11 is 1.Wait, that's interesting. So, 10^2 ‚â° 1 mod 11. That must mean that 10^even power ‚â° 1 mod 11, and 10^odd power ‚â° 10 mod 11. Let me test that with 10^3: 10^3 = 1000, and 1000 mod 11. Let's see, 11 √ó 90 = 990, so 1000 - 990 = 10. Yep, so 10^3 ‚â° 10 mod 11. Similarly, 10^4 would be 10^2 √ó 10^2, which is 1 √ó 1 = 1 mod 11. So, the pattern repeats every two exponents.Given that, 10^10 is an even exponent, so 10^10 ‚â° 1 mod 11. Therefore, 2 √ó 10^10 ‚â° 2 √ó 1 = 2 mod 11.So, going back to the original equation:2 √ó 10^10 + a ‚â° 0 mod 11Which simplifies to:2 + a ‚â° 0 mod 11So, a ‚â° -2 mod 11But since 'a' is between 0 and 11, I need to find a positive equivalent of -2 mod 11. To do that, I can add 11 to -2:-2 + 11 = 9So, a ‚â° 9 mod 11. Since 9 is within the range [0, 11), that must be the value of 'a'.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I used the fact that 10^2 ‚â° 1 mod 11, so 10^10 is (10^2)^5, which is 1^5 = 1 mod 11. Then, multiplying by 2 gives 2 mod 11. So, 2 + a ‚â° 0 mod 11 implies a ‚â° -2 mod 11, which is 9. Yeah, that seems correct.Alternatively, I could have considered the divisibility rule for 11, which involves alternating sums of digits. Let's see if that approach would work here as well, just to confirm.The number is 2 √ó 10^10 + a. Let me write out what 2 √ó 10^10 looks like. 10^10 is 10000000000, so 2 √ó 10^10 is 20000000000. Adding 'a' to that would give 20000000000 + a. Since 'a' is less than 11, it's a single digit number or a number with one digit. So, the number would be 2000000000a, where 'a' is the units digit.Now, applying the divisibility rule for 11: subtract the sum of the digits in the odd positions from the sum of the digits in the even positions. If the result is a multiple of 11 (including zero), then the number is divisible by 11.Let's write out the number: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 aPositions (from right, starting at 1): a is position 1, then the next digit is position 2, and so on up to the first digit which is position 11.Wait, actually, positions are usually counted from the right, starting at 1. So, in the number 2000000000a, the digits are:Position 11: 2Position 10: 0Position 9: 0...Position 2: 0Position 1: aSo, the sum of digits in odd positions: positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.Which are: a, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. So, sum = a + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 = a + 2.Sum of digits in even positions: positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.Which are: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So, sum = 0.Now, the difference between these sums is (a + 2) - 0 = a + 2.For the number to be divisible by 11, this difference must be a multiple of 11, including zero. So, a + 2 must be equal to 0, 11, -11, 22, etc. But since a is between 0 and 11, the only possible value is a + 2 = 11, which gives a = 9.So, both methods give me the same result: a = 9. That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work using two different methods. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm pretty sure that 'a' is 9.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{9}."},{"question":"If the equation x^2+2(a-1)x+2a+6=0 has one positive and one negative real root, then find the range of the real number a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: ( x^2 + 2(a - 1)x + 2a + 6 = 0 ). The problem says it has one positive and one negative real root, and I need to find the range of the real number ( a ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the roots can be positive, negative, or a mix. Since the problem mentions one positive and one negative root, I think this has to do with the product of the roots. I recall that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation is ( c/a ). In this case, the quadratic is ( x^2 + 2(a - 1)x + 2a + 6 ), so the product of the roots should be ( (2a + 6)/1 = 2a + 6 ).If one root is positive and the other is negative, their product must be negative because a positive times a negative is negative. So, the product of the roots ( 2a + 6 ) must be less than zero. That gives me the inequality ( 2a + 6 < 0 ). Solving for ( a ), I subtract 6 from both sides: ( 2a < -6 ), then divide by 2: ( a < -3 ). So, that suggests that ( a ) must be less than -3.But wait, I also remember that for a quadratic equation to have real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant ( D ) is ( b^2 - 4ac ). In this equation, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2(a - 1) ), and ( c = 2a + 6 ). Let me compute the discriminant:( D = [2(a - 1)]^2 - 4 * 1 * (2a + 6) )First, square ( 2(a - 1) ): ( 4(a - 1)^2 )Then, expand ( (a - 1)^2 ): ( a^2 - 2a + 1 )So, ( 4(a^2 - 2a + 1) = 4a^2 - 8a + 4 )Now, subtract ( 4*(2a + 6) ): which is ( 8a + 24 )So, ( D = 4a^2 - 8a + 4 - 8a - 24 )Combine like terms: ( 4a^2 - 16a - 20 )For the equation to have real roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero:( 4a^2 - 16a - 20 geq 0 )Let me simplify this inequality. First, divide all terms by 4 to make it easier:( a^2 - 4a - 5 geq 0 )Now, factor the quadratic:Looking for two numbers that multiply to -5 and add to -4. Hmm, that would be -5 and +1.So, ( (a - 5)(a + 1) geq 0 )To solve this inequality, I can find the critical points where the expression equals zero: ( a = 5 ) and ( a = -1 ). These points divide the number line into three intervals:1. ( a < -1 )2. ( -1 < a < 5 )3. ( a > 5 )I need to test each interval to see where the product is non-negative.- For ( a < -1 ), let's pick ( a = -2 ):  ( (-2 - 5)(-2 + 1) = (-7)(-1) = 7 ) which is positive. So, this interval satisfies the inequality.- For ( -1 < a < 5 ), let's pick ( a = 0 ):  ( (0 - 5)(0 + 1) = (-5)(1) = -5 ) which is negative. So, this interval does not satisfy the inequality.- For ( a > 5 ), let's pick ( a = 6 ):  ( (6 - 5)(6 + 1) = (1)(7) = 7 ) which is positive. So, this interval satisfies the inequality.Therefore, the discriminant is non-negative when ( a leq -1 ) or ( a geq 5 ). But earlier, I found that ( a < -3 ) for the product of the roots to be negative. So, I need to find the intersection of these two conditions.The discriminant condition gives ( a leq -1 ) or ( a geq 5 ), but the product condition requires ( a < -3 ). So, the overlap is ( a < -3 ) because ( a < -3 ) is already included in ( a leq -1 ). Therefore, the range of ( a ) is all real numbers less than -3.Wait, let me double-check. If ( a < -3 ), then it's definitely less than -1, so the discriminant is positive, and the product of the roots is negative, which means one positive and one negative root. That makes sense.Is there any other condition I might have missed? Maybe checking if the quadratic actually crosses the x-axis at two points, but since the discriminant is positive, it does have two real roots. And since the product is negative, they must be of opposite signs. So, I think that's all.So, putting it all together, the range of ( a ) is ( a < -3 ).**Final Answer**The range of the real number ( a ) is boxed{a < -3}."},{"question":"In the triangle ABC, the angle angle BAC is such that cos angle BAC = frac{4}{5}. What is the value of cos angle BCA if triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about triangle ABC where angle BAC has a cosine of 4/5, and the triangle is isosceles with AB equal to AC. I need to find the cosine of angle BCA. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that in an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal, and the angles opposite those sides are also equal. Since AB equals AC, that means angles at B and C are equal. So, angle ABC equals angle BCA. Let me denote angle BAC as angle A, and angles ABC and BCA as angles B and C respectively. So, angle A is at vertex A, and angles B and C are at vertices B and C.Given that cos(angle A) is 4/5, I can find angle A using the arccos function. Let me calculate that:angle A = arccos(4/5)I can leave it like that for now, or maybe convert it to degrees if needed, but I think working in radians might be fine since I'm dealing with trigonometric functions.Since the triangle is isosceles with AB = AC, angles B and C are equal. Let me denote each of these angles as x. So, angle B = angle C = x.In any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees, or œÄ radians. So, angle A + angle B + angle C = œÄ.Substituting the known values:angle A + x + x = œÄangle A + 2x = œÄSo, 2x = œÄ - angle Ax = (œÄ - angle A)/2So, angle B and angle C are each equal to (œÄ - angle A)/2.Now, I need to find cos(angle C), which is the same as cos(x). So, I need to find cos((œÄ - angle A)/2).I remember that there's a trigonometric identity for cosine of a half-angle. The identity is:cos(Œ∏/2) = ¬±‚àö[(1 + cosŒ∏)/2]But in this case, I have cos((œÄ - angle A)/2). Let me see if I can relate this to the half-angle identity.Let me set Œ∏ = œÄ - angle A. Then, cos((œÄ - angle A)/2) = cos(Œ∏/2) = ¬±‚àö[(1 + cosŒ∏)/2]But Œ∏ = œÄ - angle A, so cosŒ∏ = cos(œÄ - angle A). I also remember that cos(œÄ - Œ±) = -cosŒ±. So, cosŒ∏ = -cos(angle A).Therefore, cos((œÄ - angle A)/2) = ¬±‚àö[(1 - cos(angle A))/2]Now, I need to determine the sign. Since angle A is between 0 and œÄ (because it's an angle in a triangle), (œÄ - angle A)/2 will be between 0 and œÄ/2. So, the cosine of that angle will be positive. Therefore, I can drop the negative sign.So, cos(x) = ‚àö[(1 - cos(angle A))/2]Given that cos(angle A) = 4/5, let's plug that in:cos(x) = ‚àö[(1 - 4/5)/2] = ‚àö[(1/5)/2] = ‚àö(1/10) = ‚àö10 / 10Wait, but that's positive. However, in the initial problem, the triangle is isosceles with AB = AC, so angle BAC is at vertex A, and angles at B and C are equal. But in the initial problem statement, the user mentioned that the answer was negative. That seems conflicting.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the angle identification. Let me double-check.If AB = AC, then sides AB and AC are equal, so the base is BC, and the two equal sides are AB and AC. Therefore, angles at B and C are equal. So, angle B and angle C are equal.But in the initial problem, the user's solution had a negative cosine. That suggests that angle C is obtuse, but in an isosceles triangle with two equal sides, the base angles are equal and acute if the vertex angle is acute.Wait, let's see: if cos(angle A) is 4/5, then angle A is acute because cosine is positive. So, angle A is less than 90 degrees. Therefore, angles B and C must each be (180 - angle A)/2, which would also be acute angles. Therefore, their cosines should be positive.But in the initial solution, the user got a negative cosine. That seems contradictory. Maybe I need to check the steps again.Wait, perhaps I confused the angles. Let me clarify:In triangle ABC, AB = AC, so it's an isosceles triangle with AB = AC. Therefore, the base is BC, and the two equal sides are AB and AC. Therefore, angles at B and C are equal.Given that, angle BAC is the vertex angle, which is given with cos(angle BAC) = 4/5. So, angle BAC is acute, as cosine is positive.Therefore, angles at B and C are equal and acute, so their cosines should be positive.But in the initial solution, the user had a negative cosine. That suggests that maybe the triangle was considered with AB = BC instead of AB = AC, which would change the configuration.Wait, let me check the problem statement again: \\"triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC.\\" So, AB = AC, so the base is BC, and angles at B and C are equal.Therefore, angles B and C are equal and acute, so their cosines should be positive.But in the initial solution, the user had a negative cosine. That suggests that perhaps the user considered angle BAC as the base angle, which would be incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the angle identification.Wait, perhaps the user used a different approach, considering the triangle with sides AB = AC, but then using the law of cosines or something else, leading to a negative cosine.Wait, let me try using the law of cosines to find the sides and then find the cosine of angle C.Let me denote AB = AC = c, BC = a, and angle BAC = A.Given that cos(A) = 4/5, so sin(A) would be sqrt(1 - (16/25)) = 3/5.Using the law of cosines on angle A:a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos(A)But since AB = AC = c, and BC = a, so:a¬≤ = c¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2c¬≤*(4/5) = 2c¬≤ - (8/5)c¬≤ = (10c¬≤ - 8c¬≤)/5 = (2c¬≤)/5So, a = c*sqrt(2/5)Now, to find angle C, which is equal to angle B.Using the law of cosines again for angle C:cos(C) = (a¬≤ + b¬≤ - c¬≤)/(2ab)But in this case, sides opposite angle C is AB, which is c, and sides adjacent are AC = c and BC = a.Wait, no, in the law of cosines, for angle C, the sides are:cos(C) = (AC¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AB¬≤)/(2*AC*BC)But AC = AB = c, and BC = a.So, cos(C) = (c¬≤ + a¬≤ - c¬≤)/(2*c*a) = (a¬≤)/(2*c*a) = a/(2c)From earlier, a = c*sqrt(2/5), so:cos(C) = (c*sqrt(2/5))/(2c) = sqrt(2/5)/2 = sqrt(2)/sqrt(5)/2 = sqrt(2)/(2*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(10)/10Which is positive, as expected.So, cos(angle C) = sqrt(10)/10, which is approximately 0.316.But in the initial solution, the user had a negative cosine, which contradicts this result.Wait, perhaps the user considered angle BAC as the base angle, which would be incorrect because in an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, angle BAC is the vertex angle, not the base angle.Alternatively, maybe the user used a different approach, such as considering the triangle with AB = BC instead of AB = AC, which would change the configuration.Wait, let me check the problem statement again: \\"triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC.\\" So, AB = AC, so the base is BC, and angles at B and C are equal.Therefore, the correct approach is to find cos(angle C) as sqrt(10)/10, which is positive.But in the initial solution, the user had a negative cosine, which suggests a mistake in their approach.Alternatively, perhaps the user used the law of sines incorrectly, leading to a negative cosine.Wait, let me try using the law of sines.Given that AB = AC = c, angle BAC = A, angles at B and C = x.From the law of sines:a/sin(A) = c/sin(x)But a = BC, which we found earlier as c*sqrt(2/5)So,c*sqrt(2/5)/sin(A) = c/sin(x)Simplify:sqrt(2/5)/sin(A) = 1/sin(x)Therefore,sin(x) = sin(A)/sqrt(2/5)We know that sin(A) = 3/5, so:sin(x) = (3/5)/sqrt(2/5) = (3/5) * sqrt(5/2) = 3/(5) * sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = 3*sqrt(5)/(5*sqrt(2)) = 3*sqrt(10)/10So, sin(x) = 3*sqrt(10)/10Now, to find cos(x), we can use the identity cos¬≤(x) + sin¬≤(x) = 1So,cos¬≤(x) = 1 - sin¬≤(x) = 1 - (9*10)/100 = 1 - 90/100 = 10/100 = 1/10Therefore, cos(x) = sqrt(1/10) = sqrt(10)/10, which is positive, as expected.So, cos(angle C) = sqrt(10)/10.Therefore, the initial solution's negative cosine was incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the user considered angle BAC as the base angle, leading to a different configuration.Wait, if AB = AC, then angle BAC is the vertex angle, and angles at B and C are the base angles, which are equal.If instead, AB = BC, then angle BAC would be a base angle, and angles at B and C would be different.But in the problem statement, it's specified that AB = AC, so the base is BC, and angles at B and C are equal.Therefore, the correct value of cos(angle C) is sqrt(10)/10.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user's solution had a negative cosine, which suggests that perhaps they considered angle BAC as the base angle, leading to a different result.Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the angle identification or in the trigonometric identities.In any case, based on the correct approach, considering AB = AC, angle BAC is the vertex angle, and angles at B and C are equal and acute, so their cosines are positive.Therefore, the correct value of cos(angle BCA) is sqrt(10)/10.But wait, let me double-check the calculations.From the law of cosines:a¬≤ = 2c¬≤ - 2c¬≤*(4/5) = 2c¬≤ - (8/5)c¬≤ = (10c¬≤ - 8c¬≤)/5 = 2c¬≤/5So, a = c*sqrt(2/5)Then, using the law of cosines for angle C:cos(C) = (c¬≤ + a¬≤ - c¬≤)/(2*c*a) = a¬≤/(2*c*a) = a/(2c) = (c*sqrt(2/5))/(2c) = sqrt(2/5)/2 = sqrt(10)/10Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, using the law of sines:sin(x) = 3*sqrt(10)/10Then, cos(x) = sqrt(1 - (9*10)/100) = sqrt(1 - 90/100) = sqrt(10)/10So, both methods confirm that cos(angle C) = sqrt(10)/10.Therefore, the initial solution's negative cosine was incorrect, likely due to a misapplication of the trigonometric identities or incorrect angle identification.So, the correct answer should be sqrt(10)/10."},{"question":"Given a, b, c in R, and ac = b^2, a + b + c = 3, determine the range of values for b (   ).A: [0, 1]B: [-3, -1]C: [-1, 1]D: [-3, 1]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the range of values for ( b ) given that ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are real numbers, ( ac = b^2 ), and ( a + b + c = 3 ). The options are given as A: [0, 1], B: [-3, -1], C: [-1, 1], and D: [-3, 1]. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that ( ac = b^2 ). That seems like a quadratic relationship. Also, the sum ( a + b + c = 3 ). Maybe I can express ( a ) and ( c ) in terms of ( b ) somehow.Let me write down the equations:1. ( a + b + c = 3 )2. ( ac = b^2 )From the first equation, if I subtract ( b ) from both sides, I get ( a + c = 3 - b ). So, ( a + c = 3 - b ) and ( ac = b^2 ). Hmm, this looks like the sum and product of two numbers, which reminds me of quadratic equations. If I think of ( a ) and ( c ) as roots of a quadratic equation, then the quadratic would be ( x^2 - (a + c)x + ac = 0 ).Substituting the known values, that would be ( x^2 - (3 - b)x + b^2 = 0 ). So, the quadratic equation is ( x^2 - (3 - b)x + b^2 = 0 ).Now, since ( a ) and ( c ) are real numbers, the discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative. The discriminant ( D ) is given by ( D = [-(3 - b)]^2 - 4 times 1 times b^2 ).Let me compute that:( D = (3 - b)^2 - 4b^2 )Expanding ( (3 - b)^2 ):( (3 - b)^2 = 9 - 6b + b^2 )So, substituting back into ( D ):( D = 9 - 6b + b^2 - 4b^2 )Combine like terms:( D = 9 - 6b + b^2 - 4b^2 = 9 - 6b - 3b^2 )So, ( D = -3b^2 - 6b + 9 ). For the quadratic to have real roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero:( -3b^2 - 6b + 9 geq 0 )Hmm, this is a quadratic inequality. Let me rearrange it to make it easier to solve. I can factor out a -3:( -3(b^2 + 2b - 3) geq 0 )Divide both sides by -3, remembering that dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign:( b^2 + 2b - 3 leq 0 )Now, let's solve the quadratic inequality ( b^2 + 2b - 3 leq 0 ). First, find the roots of the equation ( b^2 + 2b - 3 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula:( b = frac{-2 pm sqrt{(2)^2 - 4 times 1 times (-3)}}{2 times 1} )Calculate the discriminant:( sqrt{4 + 12} = sqrt{16} = 4 )So, the roots are:( b = frac{-2 + 4}{2} = 1 ) and ( b = frac{-2 - 4}{2} = -3 )So, the quadratic ( b^2 + 2b - 3 ) factors as ( (b - 1)(b + 3) ). The inequality is ( (b - 1)(b + 3) leq 0 ).To solve this inequality, let's consider the intervals determined by the roots ( b = -3 ) and ( b = 1 ):1. When ( b < -3 ): Let's pick ( b = -4 ). Then, ( (-4 - 1)(-4 + 3) = (-5)(-1) = 5 ), which is positive. So, the inequality is not satisfied here.2. When ( -3 < b < 1 ): Let's pick ( b = 0 ). Then, ( (0 - 1)(0 + 3) = (-1)(3) = -3 ), which is negative. So, the inequality is satisfied here.3. When ( b > 1 ): Let's pick ( b = 2 ). Then, ( (2 - 1)(2 + 3) = (1)(5) = 5 ), which is positive. So, the inequality is not satisfied here.Additionally, at the critical points ( b = -3 ) and ( b = 1 ), the expression equals zero, which satisfies the inequality ( leq 0 ).Therefore, the solution to the inequality is ( -3 leq b leq 1 ).So, the range of values for ( b ) is from -3 to 1, which corresponds to option D: [-3, 1].Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check my steps.1. I started with the given equations ( a + b + c = 3 ) and ( ac = b^2 ).2. Expressed ( a + c = 3 - b ) and recognized that ( a ) and ( c ) are roots of the quadratic ( x^2 - (3 - b)x + b^2 = 0 ).3. Calculated the discriminant ( D = (3 - b)^2 - 4b^2 = 9 - 6b + b^2 - 4b^2 = 9 - 6b - 3b^2 ).4. Set ( D geq 0 ) leading to ( -3b^2 - 6b + 9 geq 0 ), which simplifies to ( b^2 + 2b - 3 leq 0 ).5. Solved the quadratic inequality, found roots at ( b = 1 ) and ( b = -3 ), tested intervals, and concluded ( -3 leq b leq 1 ).Everything seems to check out. So, I think option D is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Given an odd function f(x) satisfying f(x+2)=-f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}, and f(x) = 2^x when x in (0,1], find the value of f(2016) - f(2015).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about an odd function f(x) that satisfies f(x + 2) = -f(x) for all real numbers x. And it's given that f(x) equals 2^x when x is in the interval (0,1]. I need to find the value of f(2016) minus f(2015). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let's recall what an odd function is. An odd function satisfies the property f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. That means if I know the value of f at some positive x, I can find the value at -x by just taking the negative of that. That might come in handy later.Now, the function also satisfies f(x + 2) = -f(x). That seems like a functional equation that could help us find values of f at different points. Let me see if I can use this to find a pattern or maybe even the period of the function.If I apply the equation f(x + 2) = -f(x), and then shift x by 2 again, I get f(x + 4) = -f(x + 2). But from the original equation, f(x + 2) = -f(x), so substituting that in, f(x + 4) = -(-f(x)) = f(x). So, f(x + 4) = f(x). That means the function is periodic with period 4. That's a useful piece of information because it tells me that the function repeats every 4 units. So, to find f(2016) and f(2015), I can reduce these large numbers modulo 4 to find equivalent points within one period.Let's compute 2016 modulo 4. Since 2016 divided by 4 is 504 with no remainder, 2016 mod 4 is 0. Similarly, 2015 divided by 4 is 503 with a remainder of 3, so 2015 mod 4 is 3. Therefore, f(2016) = f(0) and f(2015) = f(3).Now, let's find f(0). Since f is an odd function, we know that f(-0) = -f(0), but -0 is just 0, so f(0) = -f(0). The only number that is equal to its own negative is 0. Therefore, f(0) = 0. So, f(2016) is 0.Next, we need to find f(3). Since the function has a period of 4, f(3) is the same as f(-1), because 3 is equivalent to -1 modulo 4 (since 3 + 1 = 4, which is a multiple of 4). So, f(3) = f(-1).But f is an odd function, so f(-1) = -f(1). We know f(1) because 1 is in the interval (0,1], and for x in (0,1], f(x) = 2^x. Therefore, f(1) = 2^1 = 2. Hence, f(-1) = -2, which means f(3) = -2.So, putting it all together, f(2016) - f(2015) = f(0) - f(3) = 0 - (-2) = 0 + 2 = 2.Wait, let me double-check that. f(2016) is f(0) which is 0, and f(2015) is f(3) which is -2. So, subtracting f(2015) from f(2016) is 0 - (-2) which is indeed 2. That seems correct.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:1. The function is odd: f(-x) = -f(x).2. The function satisfies f(x + 2) = -f(x), which leads to periodicity with period 4.3. Therefore, f(2016) = f(0) = 0.4. f(2015) = f(3) = f(-1) = -f(1) = -2.5. So, f(2016) - f(2015) = 0 - (-2) = 2.Everything checks out. I think I've got it right.**Final Answer**boxed{2}"},{"question":"In the plane, A and B are two fixed points, and C is a moving point. If overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = 1, then the trajectory of point C is ( )A: circleB: ellipseC: parabolaD: line","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where there are two fixed points, A and B, and a moving point C. The condition given is that the dot product of vectors AC and BC equals 1. I need to figure out what shape the point C traces out as it moves, and the options are circle, ellipse, parabola, or line.Okay, first, I should recall what a dot product is. The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. So, if I have vectors AC and BC, their dot product is |AC| * |BC| * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. But in this problem, the dot product is given as 1, which is a scalar value.Hmm, maybe it's easier if I assign coordinates to points A, B, and C. Let me place point A at (-a, 0) and point B at (a, 0) on the coordinate plane. That way, they're symmetric with respect to the origin, and it might simplify calculations. Let me denote point C as (x, y).So, vector AC would be from A to C, which is (x - (-a), y - 0) = (x + a, y). Similarly, vector BC is from B to C, which is (x - a, y - 0) = (x - a, y).Now, the dot product of AC and BC is given by:AC ¬∑ BC = (x + a)(x - a) + y * yLet me compute that:(x + a)(x - a) = x¬≤ - a¬≤And y * y = y¬≤So, the dot product becomes:x¬≤ - a¬≤ + y¬≤ = 1That simplifies to:x¬≤ + y¬≤ = a¬≤ + 1Wait, that looks familiar. That's the equation of a circle with radius sqrt(a¬≤ + 1) centered at the origin. So, does that mean the trajectory of point C is a circle?But hold on, I assumed points A and B are at (-a, 0) and (a, 0). What if they were placed differently? Would the result still be a circle? Let me think.If I had placed A and B at arbitrary points, say A at (h, k) and B at (p, q), then the vectors AC and BC would be (x - h, y - k) and (x - p, y - q) respectively. Their dot product would be (x - h)(x - p) + (y - k)(y - q) = 1. Expanding that, it would lead to a quadratic equation in x and y, which generally represents a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola depending on the coefficients.But in my specific case, by choosing A and B symmetrically about the origin, the equation simplified to x¬≤ + y¬≤ = constant, which is a circle. So, in this symmetric case, it's a circle. But does the general case also result in a circle?Wait, let me test with another coordinate system. Suppose A is at (0,0) and B is at (b, 0). Then vector AC is (x, y) and vector BC is (x - b, y). Their dot product is x(x - b) + y * y = x¬≤ - b x + y¬≤ = 1.So, x¬≤ + y¬≤ - b x = 1. Completing the square for x:x¬≤ - b x + (b¬≤/4) + y¬≤ = 1 + (b¬≤/4)Which is (x - b/2)¬≤ + y¬≤ = 1 + (b¬≤/4)That's also a circle, centered at (b/2, 0) with radius sqrt(1 + b¬≤/4). So, regardless of where A and B are placed, as long as they're fixed, the equation represents a circle.Therefore, the trajectory of point C is a circle.Wait, but the options are circle, ellipse, parabola, or line. So, the answer should be circle, which is option A.But just to be thorough, let me think if there's any scenario where it might not be a circle. If the dot product condition leads to a quadratic equation, and in both cases I considered, it's a circle. So, unless there's a degenerate case, it's always a circle.Alternatively, if the dot product were zero, it would represent the locus of points where AC is perpendicular to BC, which is a circle with diameter AB (Thales' theorem). But in this case, the dot product is 1, not zero, so it's a different circle, but still a circle.So, I think I'm confident that the trajectory is a circle.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Let set A = {-1, 0, 1}, and set B = {x | x = m^2 + 1, m in mathbb{R}}.

Set ( B ) is defined as ( {x mid x = m^2 + 1, m in mathbb{R}} ), which means it contains all real numbers of the form ( m^2 + 1 ).Next, I analyze set ( B ). Since ( m^2 ) is always non-negative for any real number ( m ), the smallest value ( m^2 ) can take is 0. Therefore, the smallest value in set ( B ) is ( 0 + 1 = 1 ). All other values in ( B ) are greater than 1.Now, I look at set ( A ), which contains the elements -1, 0, and 1.

After they were launched, they were indeed in short supply. The merchant then purchased a second batch of these sportswear for 26400. The quantity purchased in the second batch was twice that of the first batch, but the cost per item increased by 10.  (1) Find the number of sportswear items in the second batch purchased by the merchant.  (2) If both batches of sportswear are sold at a price of 150 per item, what is the total profit after selling all the sportswear?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a merchant who buys two batches of sportswear. The first batch costs 12,000, and the second batch costs 26,400. The second batch has twice as many items as the first, but each item in the second batch costs 10 more than the first batch. I need to find out how many items are in the second batch and then calculate the total profit if both batches are sold at 150 per item.Okay, let's start by understanding what we're dealing with here. There are two batches: the first one is smaller in quantity but cheaper per item, and the second one is larger in quantity but more expensive per item. The total cost for each batch is given, so maybe I can set up some equations based on that.Let me denote the number of items in the first batch as ( x ). Then, the number of items in the second batch would be ( 2x ) because it's twice as much. Now, the cost per item for the first batch would be the total cost divided by the number of items, which is ( frac{12000}{x} ). Similarly, the cost per item for the second batch would be ( frac{26400}{2x} ).But wait, the problem says that the cost per item increased by 10 for the second batch. So, the cost per item for the second batch is 10 more than the first batch. That gives me an equation:[frac{12000}{x} + 10 = frac{26400}{2x}]Hmm, let me make sure I got that right. The cost per item for the first batch plus 10 equals the cost per item for the second batch. Yeah, that seems right.Now, I need to solve for ( x ). Let's simplify the equation step by step.First, let's simplify the right side of the equation:[frac{26400}{2x} = frac{26400}{2x} = frac{13200}{x}]So now the equation becomes:[frac{12000}{x} + 10 = frac{13200}{x}]Okay, now I can subtract ( frac{12000}{x} ) from both sides to get:[10 = frac{13200}{x} - frac{12000}{x}]Simplifying the right side:[10 = frac{13200 - 12000}{x} = frac{1200}{x}]So, ( 10 = frac{1200}{x} ). To solve for ( x ), I can multiply both sides by ( x ):[10x = 1200]Then, divide both sides by 10:[x = 120]So, the first batch has 120 items, and the second batch has ( 2x = 240 ) items. That answers the first part of the question.Now, moving on to the second part: calculating the total profit if both batches are sold at 150 per item.First, I need to find the cost per item for both batches to calculate the profit.For the first batch:- Total cost: 12,000- Number of items: 120- Cost per item: ( frac{12000}{120} = 100 ) dollarsFor the second batch:- Total cost: 26,400- Number of items: 240- Cost per item: ( frac{26400}{240} = 110 ) dollarsWait, that makes sense because the cost per item increased by 10, as given in the problem.Now, the selling price per item is 150. So, the profit per item for the first batch is:[150 - 100 = 50 text{ dollars}]And for the second batch:[150 - 110 = 40 text{ dollars}]Now, to find the total profit, I need to multiply the profit per item by the number of items in each batch and then add them together.Total profit = (Profit per item for first batch √ó Number of items in first batch) + (Profit per item for second batch √ó Number of items in second batch)Plugging in the numbers:Total profit = ( 50 times 120 + 40 times 240 )Let's calculate each part:( 50 times 120 = 6000 ) dollars( 40 times 240 = 9600 ) dollarsAdding them together:[6000 + 9600 = 15600 text{ dollars}]So, the total profit after selling all the sportswear is 15,600.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, the number of items in the second batch is 240, which seems correct because 2 times 120 is 240.Cost per item for the first batch: 100, and for the second batch: 110, which is 10 more, as stated.Profit per item: 50 for the first batch and 40 for the second batch. That seems right since 150 minus 100 is 50, and 150 minus 110 is 40.Total profit calculation: 120 items √ó 50 = 6,000 and 240 items √ó 40 = 9,600. Adding them gives 15,600. That seems correct.Okay, I think I've got it right."},{"question":"For real numbers a and b, the operation \\"‚óé\\" is defined as follows: a‚óéb=left(a+bright)^{2}-left(a-bright)^{2}. If left(m+1right)‚óéleft(m-2right)=16, then m=____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where there's a special operation defined for real numbers a and b, called \\"‚óé\\". The operation is given by a‚óéb = (a + b)¬≤ - (a - b)¬≤. I need to find the value of m such that when I perform this operation on (m + 1) and (m - 2), the result is 16. First, I should probably try to understand what this operation \\"‚óé\\" actually does. It looks like it's taking two numbers, adding them together, squaring the result, then subtracting the square of their difference. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.Let me write down the definition again: a‚óéb = (a + b)¬≤ - (a - b)¬≤. Maybe if I expand both squares, I can see if there's a pattern or a simpler form.So, expanding (a + b)¬≤, I get a¬≤ + 2ab + b¬≤. Similarly, expanding (a - b)¬≤ gives me a¬≤ - 2ab + b¬≤. Now, subtracting these two expressions: (a¬≤ + 2ab + b¬≤) - (a¬≤ - 2ab + b¬≤). Let's do that step by step.First, subtract a¬≤ from a¬≤, which cancels out. Then, subtract -2ab from 2ab, which is like adding 4ab. Finally, subtract b¬≤ from b¬≤, which also cancels out. So, after simplifying, I'm left with 4ab. Oh, that's nice! So, the operation \\"‚óé\\" simplifies to 4ab. That makes things easier. So, instead of dealing with all that squaring and subtracting, I can just multiply the two numbers and then multiply by 4. Alright, so now I can rewrite the given equation using this simplified form. The problem says that (m + 1)‚óé(m - 2) = 16. Using the simplified operation, this becomes 4*(m + 1)*(m - 2) = 16.Now, let's write that out: 4*(m + 1)*(m - 2) = 16. My goal is to solve for m. So, first, maybe I can divide both sides by 4 to make it simpler. Dividing both sides by 4 gives me: (m + 1)*(m - 2) = 4. Now, I need to expand the left side. Multiplying (m + 1) and (m - 2) together. Let's use the distributive property (FOIL method). First, multiply m by m, which is m¬≤. Then, m times -2 is -2m. Next, 1 times m is m, and 1 times -2 is -2. So, putting it all together: m¬≤ - 2m + m - 2. Combine like terms: -2m + m is -m. So, the expression simplifies to m¬≤ - m - 2. So now, my equation is m¬≤ - m - 2 = 4. To solve for m, I should bring the 4 to the left side by subtracting 4 from both sides. Subtracting 4 from both sides: m¬≤ - m - 2 - 4 = 0, which simplifies to m¬≤ - m - 6 = 0. Now, I have a quadratic equation: m¬≤ - m - 6 = 0. I need to solve for m. There are a few methods to solve quadratic equations: factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me see if this can be factored.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to -1. Let's think: factors of -6 could be 2 and -3, because 2 * (-3) = -6, and 2 + (-3) = -1. Perfect! So, the equation can be factored as (m + 2)(m - 3) = 0.Setting each factor equal to zero gives the possible solutions: 1. m + 2 = 0 => m = -22. m - 3 = 0 => m = 3So, the solutions are m = -2 and m = 3. But wait, I should check these solutions to make sure they actually work in the original equation. Sometimes, especially when dealing with quadratics, you can get extraneous solutions that don't satisfy the original equation.Let's check m = -2 first. Plugging back into the original operation: (m + 1)‚óé(m - 2). So, m = -2: (m + 1) = (-2 + 1) = -1(m - 2) = (-2 - 2) = -4Now, compute -1‚óé-4. Using the simplified operation, that's 4*(-1)*(-4) = 4*4 = 16. Which matches the given equation, so m = -2 is a valid solution.Now, let's check m = 3.(m + 1) = (3 + 1) = 4(m - 2) = (3 - 2) = 1Compute 4‚óé1: 4*4*1 = 16. Again, that's 16, which matches the given equation. So, m = 3 is also a valid solution.Therefore, both m = -2 and m = 3 satisfy the equation, so they are both correct solutions.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my steps, and both solutions check out when plugged back into the original equation. So, the values of m are -2 and 3.**Final Answer**The values of ( m ) are boxed{-2} and boxed{3}."},{"question":"The number 0.504 can be written as a fraction frac{p}{q} for positive integers p and q.

I can do this by expressing it as 504 over 1000, since there are three digits after the decimal point.Next, I should simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 504 and 1000. Breaking down both numbers into their prime factors, I find that 504 is 2 cubed times 3 squared times 7, and 1000 is 2 cubed times 5 cubed. The common factor is 2 cubed, which is 8.I divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 8. This simplifies the fraction to 63 over 125.Finally, I add the numerator and the denominator of the simplified fraction to get the final answer."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, angle B is bisected by BD which meets AC at D. If AB = 2BC, find the ratio frac{AD}{DC}.A) 1B) 2C) 3D) frac{1}{2}E) frac{3}{2}","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that angle B is bisected by BD, which meets AC at D. Also, it's given that AB is twice as long as BC. I need to find the ratio of AD to DC. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember there's something called the Angle Bisector Theorem. I think it says that if a bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments, then those segments are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle. So, in this case, since BD is the angle bisector of angle B, it should divide side AC into segments AD and DC such that the ratio of AD to DC is equal to the ratio of AB to BC.Let me write that down to make it clearer. According to the Angle Bisector Theorem:[frac{AD}{DC} = frac{AB}{BC}]Now, the problem states that AB is equal to twice BC. So, AB = 2 * BC. Let me substitute that into the equation:[frac{AD}{DC} = frac{2 times BC}{BC}]Simplifying the right side, the BC in the numerator and denominator cancel out:[frac{AD}{DC} = 2]So, the ratio of AD to DC is 2. That means AD is twice as long as DC. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. I applied the Angle Bisector Theorem correctly, substituted the given lengths, and simplified. It seems straightforward.Wait, let me visualize the triangle to double-check. Triangle ABC with AB = 2BC. So, point B is the vertex with the angle being bisected. BD is the bisector, hitting AC at D. So, AD is the segment closer to A, and DC is closer to C. Since AB is longer than BC, the angle bisector should make AD longer than DC, which matches the ratio I found.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using coordinate geometry or trigonometry? Let me see. If I assign coordinates to the points, I could calculate the lengths, but that might be more complicated. The Angle Bisector Theorem seems like the most efficient method here.Alternatively, I could use mass point geometry, but I think that also relies on the same principle as the Angle Bisector Theorem. So, regardless of the method, the ratio should come out the same.Just to recap: Angle Bisector Theorem gives the ratio of the divided sides as equal to the ratio of the other two sides. Given AB is twice BC, the ratio of AD to DC is 2. So, the answer should be 2, which is option B.I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. The steps are logical and follow from the theorem. I think I'm confident with this answer.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Vincent's washer broke so he had to go to the laundromat. On Wednesday he washed 6 loads of clothes. The next day he had time to wash some loads of clothes. On Friday he had a test and could only manage half of the loads he did on Thursday. On Saturday the laundromat closed at noon and he could only wash a third of the loads of laundry he did on Wednesday. He washed 26 loads of laundry that week. What is the ratio of the number of loads he washed on Thursday to the number of loads he washed on Wednesday?","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of loads Vincent washed on Thursday. Let's denote this number as ( T ).On Wednesday, Vincent washed 6 loads. On Thursday, he washed ( T ) loads. On Friday, he washed half of what he did on Thursday, which is ( frac{T}{2} ) loads. On Saturday, he washed a third of what he did on Wednesday, which is ( frac{6}{3} = 2 ) loads.The total number of loads washed during the week is 26.

What is the smallest possible value of d?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: A point (5‚àö5, d+4) is 5d units away from the origin. I need to find the smallest possible value of d. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) can be found using the distance formula, which is ‚àö(x¬≤ + y¬≤). So, in this case, the distance from (5‚àö5, d+4) to the origin should be ‚àö[(5‚àö5)¬≤ + (d+4)¬≤]. The problem says this distance is equal to 5d. So, I can set up the equation:‚àö[(5‚àö5)¬≤ + (d+4)¬≤] = 5dAlright, let me compute (5‚àö5)¬≤ first. 5 squared is 25, and (‚àö5) squared is 5, so 25*5 is 125. So, that part is 125.Now, the other part is (d+4)¬≤. Expanding that, it's d¬≤ + 8d + 16. So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:‚àö[125 + d¬≤ + 8d + 16] = 5dLet me simplify inside the square root. 125 + 16 is 141, so:‚àö[d¬≤ + 8d + 141] = 5dNow, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. That should help me solve for d.So, squaring both sides:(‚àö[d¬≤ + 8d + 141])¬≤ = (5d)¬≤Which simplifies to:d¬≤ + 8d + 141 = 25d¬≤Hmm, now I need to bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let me subtract d¬≤ + 8d + 141 from both sides:0 = 25d¬≤ - d¬≤ - 8d - 141Simplifying that:0 = 24d¬≤ - 8d - 141So, the quadratic equation is 24d¬≤ - 8d - 141 = 0.Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is d = [-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a is 24, b is -8, and c is -141.Let me plug these values into the quadratic formula.First, compute the discriminant: b¬≤ - 4ac.b¬≤ is (-8)¬≤, which is 64.4ac is 4 * 24 * (-141). Let me compute that step by step.4 * 24 is 96. Then, 96 * (-141). Hmm, 96 * 100 is 9600, 96 * 40 is 3840, and 96 * 1 is 96. So, 9600 + 3840 is 13440, plus 96 is 13536. But since it's negative, it's -13536.So, the discriminant is 64 - (-13536). Wait, that's 64 + 13536, which is 13600.Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.4ac is 4 * 24 * (-141). So, 4*24 is 96, and 96*(-141). Let me compute 96*141 first.141 * 96: 141*90 is 12690, and 141*6 is 846. Adding them together: 12690 + 846 is 13536. So, 96*(-141) is -13536. So, the discriminant is 64 - (-13536) = 64 + 13536 = 13600. Okay, that seems correct.So, discriminant is 13600. Now, let's compute the square root of 13600. Hmm, 13600 is 100*136, so ‚àö13600 is ‚àö(100*136) = 10‚àö136.Now, ‚àö136 can be simplified. 136 is 4*34, so ‚àö136 is ‚àö(4*34) = 2‚àö34. Therefore, ‚àö13600 is 10*2‚àö34 = 20‚àö34.So, the square root of the discriminant is 20‚àö34.Now, plugging back into the quadratic formula:d = [-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)] / (2a) = [-(-8) ¬± 20‚àö34] / (2*24) = [8 ¬± 20‚àö34] / 48Simplify numerator and denominator:We can factor out 4 from numerator and denominator:[8 ¬± 20‚àö34] / 48 = [4*(2 ¬± 5‚àö34)] / 48 = (2 ¬± 5‚àö34)/12So, the two solutions are:d = (2 + 5‚àö34)/12 and d = (2 - 5‚àö34)/12Now, let's compute these values numerically to see which one is the smallest possible value of d.First, compute ‚àö34. ‚àö34 is approximately 5.83095.So, 5‚àö34 ‚âà 5 * 5.83095 ‚âà 29.15475Now, compute (2 + 5‚àö34)/12 ‚âà (2 + 29.15475)/12 ‚âà 31.15475/12 ‚âà 2.5962And (2 - 5‚àö34)/12 ‚âà (2 - 29.15475)/12 ‚âà (-27.15475)/12 ‚âà -2.2629Now, since distance cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. So, d ‚âà 2.5962.But wait, let me think again. The problem says the point is 5d units away from the origin. So, 5d must be a positive distance, which it is as long as d is positive. So, d must be positive, so the negative solution is invalid.Therefore, the only valid solution is approximately 2.5962.But the question asks for the smallest possible value of d. Since we only have one valid solution, that must be the smallest possible value.Wait, but let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe d can be negative? But if d is negative, then 5d would be negative, which doesn't make sense for a distance. So, d must be positive.Therefore, the smallest possible value of d is approximately 2.5962. But let me express this exactly.From earlier, we had d = (2 + 5‚àö34)/12. Let me see if this can be simplified further.Well, 2 and 5‚àö34 don't have common factors, so that's probably the simplest form. Alternatively, we can write it as (1 + (5/2)‚àö34)/6, but that doesn't really simplify it more.Alternatively, we can rationalize or present it in another form, but I think (2 + 5‚àö34)/12 is acceptable.But wait, let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the distance formula:‚àö[(5‚àö5)^2 + (d + 4)^2] = 5dComputed (5‚àö5)^2 correctly as 125.Expanded (d + 4)^2 correctly as d¬≤ + 8d + 16.Added 125 + 16 to get 141, so ‚àö(d¬≤ + 8d + 141) = 5d.Squared both sides: d¬≤ + 8d + 141 = 25d¬≤.Subtracting d¬≤ + 8d + 141: 0 = 24d¬≤ - 8d - 141.Quadratic formula: d = [8 ¬± ‚àö(64 + 13536)] / 48.Wait, hold on, earlier I thought discriminant was 13600, but 64 + 13536 is indeed 13600. So, that's correct.‚àö13600 is 20‚àö34, so d = [8 ¬± 20‚àö34]/48, which simplifies to [2 ¬± 5‚àö34]/12.Yes, that seems correct.So, the exact value is (2 + 5‚àö34)/12, which is approximately 2.596.Therefore, the smallest possible value of d is (2 + 5‚àö34)/12, which is approximately 2.596.Wait, but the problem asks for the smallest possible value. Since d must be positive, and we have only one positive solution, that's the smallest.Alternatively, if there were two positive solutions, we would pick the smaller one, but in this case, only one is positive.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The smallest possible value of ( d ) is boxed{dfrac{2 + 5sqrt{34}}{12}}."},{"question":"The hyperbola [x^2 - 4y^2 - 6x + 24y - 11 = 0] has two foci. Find the coordinates of either of them. (Enter your answer as an ordered pair. Enter only one of the foci, not both.)","answer":"Okay, so I have this hyperbola equation: x¬≤ - 4y¬≤ - 6x + 24y - 11 = 0. I need to find the coordinates of one of its foci. Hmm, I remember that hyperbolas have standard forms, and from there, you can find the foci. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so let me think.First, I think I need to rewrite the given equation into the standard form of a hyperbola. The standard form is either (x - h)¬≤/a¬≤ - (y - k)¬≤/b¬≤ = 1 or (y - k)¬≤/a¬≤ - (x - h)¬≤/b¬≤ = 1, depending on whether it's opening horizontally or vertically. Looking at the given equation, the x¬≤ term is positive and the y¬≤ term is negative, so it must be a horizontal hyperbola. That means the standard form will be (x - h)¬≤/a¬≤ - (y - k)¬≤/b¬≤ = 1.To get there, I need to complete the square for both x and y terms. Let me group the x terms and y terms together:x¬≤ - 6x - 4y¬≤ + 24y = 11.Wait, actually, I should factor out the coefficients of the squared terms first for the y terms. So, let me rearrange the equation:x¬≤ - 6x - 4(y¬≤ - 6y) = 11.Okay, now I can complete the square for x and y separately.Starting with the x terms: x¬≤ - 6x. To complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of x, which is -6, so half of that is -3, and then square it, getting 9. So, I add and subtract 9:(x¬≤ - 6x + 9) - 9.Similarly, for the y terms inside the parentheses: y¬≤ - 6y. Half of -6 is -3, squared is 9. So, I add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses:(y¬≤ - 6y + 9) - 9.But remember, the -4 is factored out, so when I subtract 9 inside, it's actually subtracting 4*9, which is 36. Let me write this out step by step.Starting equation after grouping:x¬≤ - 6x - 4(y¬≤ - 6y) = 11.Completing the square for x:(x¬≤ - 6x + 9) - 9 - 4(y¬≤ - 6y) = 11.Completing the square for y:(x¬≤ - 6x + 9) - 9 - 4[(y¬≤ - 6y + 9) - 9] = 11.Simplify the equation:(x - 3)¬≤ - 9 - 4(y - 3)¬≤ + 36 = 11.Combine constants:-9 + 36 = 27, so:(x - 3)¬≤ - 4(y - 3)¬≤ + 27 = 11.Subtract 27 from both sides:(x - 3)¬≤ - 4(y - 3)¬≤ = -16.Hmm, that negative on the right side is a bit confusing. In the standard form, the right side should be 1. So, I need to divide both sides by -16 to make it equal to 1:[(x - 3)¬≤]/(-16) - [4(y - 3)¬≤]/(-16) = 1.Wait, that would make the denominators negative, which doesn't make sense because a¬≤ and b¬≤ should be positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.Let me go back. After completing the square, I had:(x - 3)¬≤ - 4(y - 3)¬≤ + 27 = 11.Then subtracting 27:(x - 3)¬≤ - 4(y - 3)¬≤ = -16.Ah, so to make the right side positive, I can multiply both sides by -1:- (x - 3)¬≤ + 4(y - 3)¬≤ = 16.But that would mean the standard form is:4(y - 3)¬≤ - (x - 3)¬≤ = 16.Divide both sides by 16 to get 1 on the right:[4(y - 3)¬≤]/16 - [(x - 3)¬≤]/16 = 1.Simplify:(y - 3)¬≤/4 - (x - 3)¬≤/16 = 1.Wait, so now it's in the form (y - k)¬≤/a¬≤ - (x - h)¬≤/b¬≤ = 1, which means it's a vertical hyperbola, not horizontal as I initially thought. That makes sense because after rearranging, the y term is positive. So, I was wrong earlier; it's a vertical hyperbola.So, h = 3, k = 3, a¬≤ = 4, so a = 2, and b¬≤ = 16, so b = 4.Now, for hyperbolas, the distance to the foci is given by c, where c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤. So, c¬≤ = 4 + 16 = 20, so c = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5).Since it's a vertical hyperbola, the foci are located at (h, k ¬± c). So, plugging in the values:Foci at (3, 3 + 2‚àö5) and (3, 3 - 2‚àö5).So, either of these is a valid answer. I'll choose one, say (3, 3 + 2‚àö5).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Started by grouping x and y terms correctly.2. Completed the square for x: (x - 3)¬≤ - 9.3. Completed the square for y: (y - 3)¬≤ - 9, but since it's multiplied by -4, it becomes -4(y - 3)¬≤ + 36.4. Combined constants: -9 + 36 = 27.5. Subtracted 27 from both sides: (x - 3)¬≤ - 4(y - 3)¬≤ = -16.6. Realized the right side is negative, so multiplied both sides by -1 to get positive 16.7. Divided by 16 to get standard form: (y - 3)¬≤/4 - (x - 3)¬≤/16 = 1.8. Identified a¬≤ = 4, b¬≤ = 16, so a = 2, b = 4.9. Calculated c = sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) = sqrt(20) = 2‚àö5.10. Since it's vertical, foci are at (h, k ¬± c) = (3, 3 ¬± 2‚àö5).Everything seems to check out. So, the coordinates of either focus are (3, 3 + 2‚àö5) or (3, 3 - 2‚àö5). I'll go with (3, 3 + 2‚àö5) as the answer."},{"question":"If ( A = 5 - 2i ), ( M = -3 + 2i ), ( S = 2i ), and ( P = 3 ), find ( A - M + S - P ).","answer":"First, I need to substitute the given values into the expression ( A - M + S - P ).Substituting the values:[(5 - 2i) - (-3 + 2i) + (2i) - 3]Next, I'll handle the subtraction of the complex numbers by distributing the negative sign:[5 - 2i + 3 - 2i + 2i - 3]Now, I'll combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:- Real parts: ( 5 + 3 - 3 = 5 )- Imaginary parts: ( -2i - 2i + 2i = -2i )Finally, combining the results gives:[5 - 2i]"},{"question":"Determine the largest prime factor of 12769.","answer":"Alright, so I need to figure out the largest prime factor of 12769. Hmm, prime factors... Okay, prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. So, I need to break down 12769 into its prime components and then identify the largest one.First, I remember that to find prime factors, I can start by checking divisibility starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2. But 12769 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. Next, I'll check for 3. To see if a number is divisible by 3, I can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3.Let's add the digits of 12769: 1 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 9. That equals 25. Hmm, 25 isn't divisible by 3, so 12769 isn't divisible by 3 either. Moving on to the next prime number, which is 5. Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5, but 12769 ends with a 9, so it's not divisible by 5.Next up is 7. Divisibility by 7 is a bit trickier. I think there's a rule where you double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number. Let's try that: Take the last digit, which is 9, double it to get 18, and subtract that from the remaining number, which is 1276. So, 1276 - 18 equals 1258. Now, I need to check if 1258 is divisible by 7. I'll do the same thing: double the last digit (8) to get 16, subtract that from 125, which gives me 109. 109 divided by 7 is approximately 15.57, which isn't a whole number, so 12769 isn't divisible by 7.Okay, moving on to 11. The rule for 11 is to subtract and add the digits alternately. So, starting from the right: 9 (positive), 6 (negative), 7 (positive), 2 (negative), 1 (positive). That gives us 9 - 6 + 7 - 2 + 1. Calculating that: 9 - 6 is 3, 3 + 7 is 10, 10 - 2 is 8, 8 + 1 is 9. Since 9 isn't divisible by 11, 12769 isn't divisible by 11.Next prime is 13. I'm not sure about a quick divisibility rule for 13, so I'll just try dividing 12769 by 13. Let's see, 13 times 982 is 12766, which is close to 12769. Subtracting, 12769 - 12766 equals 3, so there's a remainder of 3. Therefore, 12769 isn't divisible by 13.Continuing to 17. Again, not sure of a quick rule, so I'll divide 12769 by 17. 17 times 750 is 12750, and 12769 - 12750 is 19. Since 19 is less than 17, it doesn't divide evenly. So, 12769 isn't divisible by 17.Next is 19. Let's try dividing 12769 by 19. 19 times 672 is 12768, which is just one less than 12769. So, 12769 divided by 19 is 672 with a remainder of 1. Not divisible by 19.Moving on to 23. Let's see, 23 times 555 is 12765. Subtracting that from 12769 gives 4, so there's a remainder. Not divisible by 23.Next prime is 29. 29 times 440 is 12760. Subtracting, 12769 - 12760 is 9, so remainder 9. Not divisible by 29.Then 31. 31 times 412 is 12772, which is 3 more than 12769, so remainder is negative 3. Not divisible by 31.Next is 37. Let's try 37 times 345 is 12765. Subtracting, 12769 - 12765 is 4, so remainder 4. Not divisible by 37.Continuing to 41. 41 times 311 is 12751. Subtracting, 12769 - 12751 is 18, so remainder 18. Not divisible by 41.Next prime is 43. 43 times 296 is 12728. Subtracting, 12769 - 12728 is 41, which is less than 43, so remainder 41. Not divisible by 43.Moving on to 47. 47 times 271 is 12737. Subtracting, 12769 - 12737 is 32, so remainder 32. Not divisible by 47.Next is 53. 53 times 240 is 12720. Subtracting, 12769 - 12720 is 49. 49 is 7 squared, so not divisible by 53.Then 59. 59 times 216 is 12744. Subtracting, 12769 - 12744 is 25, so remainder 25. Not divisible by 59.Next prime is 61. 61 times 209 is 12749. Subtracting, 12769 - 12749 is 20, so remainder 20. Not divisible by 61.Continuing to 67. 67 times 190 is 12630. Subtracting, 12769 - 12630 is 139. 139 is a prime number, so 67 doesn't divide into 12769.Next is 71. 71 times 180 is 12780, which is 11 more than 12769, so remainder is negative 11. Not divisible by 71.Moving on to 73. 73 times 174 is 12702. Subtracting, 12769 - 12702 is 67, which is less than 73, so remainder 67. Not divisible by 73.Next prime is 79. 79 times 161 is 12719. Subtracting, 12769 - 12719 is 50, so remainder 50. Not divisible by 79.Then 83. 83 times 153 is 12719. Subtracting, 12769 - 12719 is 50, same as before. Remainder 50. Not divisible by 83.Next is 89. 89 times 143 is 12727. Subtracting, 12769 - 12727 is 42, so remainder 42. Not divisible by 89.Moving on to 97. 97 times 131 is 12707. Subtracting, 12769 - 12707 is 62, so remainder 62. Not divisible by 97.Next prime is 101. 101 times 126 is 12726. Subtracting, 12769 - 12726 is 43, so remainder 43. Not divisible by 101.Continuing to 103. 103 times 123 is 12669. Subtracting, 12769 - 12669 is 100, so remainder 100. Not divisible by 103.Next is 107. 107 times 119 is 12733. Subtracting, 12769 - 12733 is 36, so remainder 36. Not divisible by 107.Then 109. 109 times 117 is 12753. Subtracting, 12769 - 12753 is 16, so remainder 16. Not divisible by 109.Moving on to 113. 113 times 112 is 12656. Subtracting, 12769 - 12656 is 113. Wait, 113 times 113 is 12769? Let me check: 113 squared is 12769. Oh! So, 113 times 113 equals 12769. That means 113 is a prime factor, and since it's squared, it's the only prime factor besides 1. But wait, is 113 a prime number?To confirm, I need to check if 113 is prime. Let's see, the square root of 113 is approximately 10.63, so I only need to check primes up to 11. We've already checked 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. 113 divided by 2 is 56.5, not whole. 113 divided by 3 is about 37.666, not whole. Divided by 5 is 22.6, not whole. Divided by 7 is about 16.14, not whole. Divided by 11 is about 10.27, not whole. So, 113 is indeed a prime number.Therefore, the prime factorization of 12769 is 113 squared, which means the only prime factor is 113. Hence, the largest prime factor is 113.Wait a minute, but in the initial problem, the user mentioned expressing 12769 as 130 squared minus 121 squared, which equals 9 times 251. So, according to that, 251 is a prime factor. But according to my calculation, 12769 is 113 squared. There's a discrepancy here. Did I make a mistake?Let me double-check my calculations. 113 times 113 is indeed 12769. But according to the difference of squares method, 130 squared is 16900, and 121 squared is 14641. Subtracting, 16900 - 14641 equals 2259, not 12769. Wait, that can't be right. There must be an error in the initial problem's setup.Wait, no, the user wrote 12769 equals 130 squared minus 121 squared. Let me verify that: 130 squared is 16900, 121 squared is 14641. 16900 minus 14641 is indeed 2259, not 12769. So, that seems incorrect. Therefore, the initial approach might be flawed.Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the initial expression. Let me try to factor 12769 correctly. Since 12769 is 113 squared, and 113 is prime, the only prime factor is 113. Therefore, the largest prime factor is 113.But why did the initial approach suggest 251? Perhaps there was a miscalculation there. Let me check: 130 squared is 16900, 121 squared is 14641. 16900 minus 14641 is 2259, not 12769. So, that approach was incorrect. Therefore, the correct prime factorization is 113 squared, making 113 the largest prime factor.Alternatively, maybe the user intended a different approach. Let me try another method to confirm. Let's see, 12769 divided by 113 is 113, so that's correct. Therefore, 113 is the only prime factor, and it's the largest.Wait, but I'm confused because the initial method suggested 251 as a factor. Maybe the user had a different number in mind. Let me check 12769 again. 113 times 113 is indeed 12769. So, the correct largest prime factor is 113.Perhaps the initial approach was incorrect because the difference of squares was miscalculated. Instead of 130 squared minus 121 squared, maybe it's another pair of squares. Let me try to find squares that differ by 12769.Let me assume that 12769 equals a squared minus b squared, which factors into (a - b)(a + b). So, I need two numbers whose product is 12769, and their sum and difference are both even or both odd. Since 12769 is odd, both a and b must be either both even or both odd. But since 12769 is odd, a and b must be both odd.Let me list the factor pairs of 12769. Since 12769 is 113 squared, the only factor pairs are 1 and 12769, and 113 and 113. Therefore, the only way to express 12769 as a difference of squares is 113 squared minus 0 squared, which isn't helpful. Therefore, the initial approach was incorrect because 130 squared minus 121 squared does not equal 12769.Thus, the correct prime factorization is 113 squared, making 113 the largest prime factor."},{"question":"Given two natural numbers Q and Q' where Q > Q', when Q and Q' are divided by a natural number E, the remainders are S and S', respectively. Further, it is known that when Q^2 Q' and S^2 S' are divided by E, the remainders are s and s', respectively. Determine the relationship between s and s'.A) s > s' alwaysB) s < s' alwaysC) s > s' sometimes and s < s' sometimesD) s > s' sometimes and s = s' sometimesE) s = s' always","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about two natural numbers, Q and Q', where Q is bigger than Q'. When both Q and Q' are divided by another natural number E, they leave remainders S and S' respectively. Then, it says that when we take Q squared times Q' and divide it by E, the remainder is s, and similarly, when we take S squared times S' and divide it by E, the remainder is s'. The question is asking about the relationship between s and s'. The options are whether s is always greater than s', always less, sometimes one or the other, or if they are always equal.Alright, let's break this down. First, since Q and Q' are divided by E and leave remainders S and S', that means Q is congruent to S modulo E, and Q' is congruent to S' modulo E. So, mathematically, we can write:Q ‚â° S (mod E)Q' ‚â° S' (mod E)That means when we divide Q by E, the remainder is S, and similarly for Q' and S'.Now, the problem mentions Q¬≤Q' and S¬≤S'. We need to find the remainders when these two expressions are divided by E, which are s and s' respectively.So, let's think about Q¬≤Q'. Since Q ‚â° S (mod E), then Q¬≤ ‚â° S¬≤ (mod E). Similarly, since Q' ‚â° S' (mod E), multiplying these congruences together, we get Q¬≤Q' ‚â° S¬≤S' (mod E). Wait, so if Q¬≤Q' is congruent to S¬≤S' modulo E, that means when you divide both Q¬≤Q' and S¬≤S' by E, they leave the same remainder. So, s should be equal to s'.But let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Is there a case where s might not equal s'? Let's test with some numbers.Suppose E is 5, Q is 7, so S would be 2 because 7 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2. Let Q' be 3, so S' would be 3 because 3 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3.Now, Q¬≤Q' is 7¬≤ * 3 = 49 * 3 = 147. Dividing 147 by 5, the remainder is 2 because 5*29=145, and 147-145=2. So s is 2.On the other hand, S¬≤S' is 2¬≤ * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12. Dividing 12 by 5, the remainder is 2 as well. So s' is also 2. They are equal.Let me try another example. Let E be 7, Q be 10, so S is 3 because 10 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 3. Let Q' be 5, so S' is 5 because 5 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 5.Calculating Q¬≤Q' is 10¬≤ * 5 = 100 * 5 = 500. Dividing 500 by 7, 7*71=497, so the remainder is 3. So s is 3.Now, S¬≤S' is 3¬≤ * 5 = 9 * 5 = 45. Dividing 45 by 7, 7*6=42, so the remainder is 3. So s' is also 3. Again, they are equal.Hmm, seems consistent. Let me try one more example where maybe the remainders are different.Let E be 6, Q be 8, so S is 2 because 8 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 2. Let Q' be 4, so S' is 4 because 4 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 4.Calculating Q¬≤Q' is 8¬≤ * 4 = 64 * 4 = 256. Dividing 256 by 6, 6*42=252, so the remainder is 4. So s is 4.Now, S¬≤S' is 2¬≤ * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16. Dividing 16 by 6, 6*2=12, so the remainder is 4. So s' is also 4. Again, equal.Wait, so in all these examples, s equals s'. Is there a case where they wouldn't be equal? Maybe if E is 1, but E is a natural number, so E=1 is allowed. Let's see.If E=1, then any number divided by 1 leaves a remainder of 0. So S and S' would both be 0. Then, Q¬≤Q' would be some number, but when divided by 1, the remainder is 0, so s=0. Similarly, S¬≤S' is 0¬≤*0=0, so s'=0. They are equal.Another edge case: E=2, Q=3, so S=1. Q'=1, so S'=1.Q¬≤Q' is 9*1=9. Divided by 2, remainder is 1. So s=1.S¬≤S' is 1*1=1. Divided by 2, remainder is 1. So s'=1. Equal again.Wait, maybe I need to think about negative numbers, but since we're dealing with natural numbers, remainders are always non-negative and less than E. So, no negative remainders here.Is there a mathematical reason why s must equal s'? From the congruences:Q ‚â° S (mod E)Q' ‚â° S' (mod E)Then, Q¬≤ ‚â° S¬≤ (mod E)And Q' ‚â° S' (mod E)Multiplying these, Q¬≤Q' ‚â° S¬≤S' (mod E)Which means that Q¬≤Q' and S¬≤S' leave the same remainder when divided by E, so s = s'.Therefore, it's always the case that s equals s'. So the answer should be E) s = s' always.Wait, but let me think again. Is there any situation where even though Q¬≤Q' ‚â° S¬≤S' mod E, the remainders s and s' could be different? But no, because if two numbers are congruent modulo E, they have the same remainder when divided by E. So s and s' must be equal.Yeah, I think that's solid. So the relationship is that s equals s' always."},{"question":"The circumference of a circle D is 100 feet. What is the length of the arc widehat{EF} if the angle angle EDF at the center is 45^circ?","answer":"First, I recognize that the circumference of circle ( D ) is given as 100 feet.Next, since the central angle ( angle EDF ) is ( 45^circ ), the arc ( widehat{EF} ) corresponds to ( frac{45}{360} ) of the full circle.I calculate the fraction of the circle that arc ( widehat{EF} ) represents:[frac{45}{360} = frac{1}{8}]To find the length of arc ( widehat{EF} ), I multiply the total circumference by this fraction:[text{Length of } widehat{EF} = frac{1}{8} times 100 = 12.5 text{ feet}]Therefore, the length of arc ( widehat{EF} ) is (boxed{12.5}) feet."},{"question":"Given the function ( f(x) = x^2 + x + m ) where ( m in mathbf{R}^{+} ), if ( f(t) < 0 ), determine the existence of zeros of the function ( y = f(x) ) in the interval ( (t, t+1) ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a quadratic function ( f(x) = x^2 + x + m ) with ( m ) being a positive real number. The condition is that ( f(t) < 0 ), and I need to figure out if there's a zero of the function ( y = f(x) ) in the interval ( (t, t+1) ).First, I remember that quadratic functions graph as parabolas. Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (which is 1 in this case), the parabola opens upwards. That means the function will have a minimum point, and it will tend to infinity as ( x ) goes to both positive and negative infinity.Now, since ( f(t) < 0 ), that tells me that the point ( t ) is between the two roots of the quadratic equation ( x^2 + x + m = 0 ). Because the parabola opens upwards, the function is negative between its two roots. So, if ( f(t) < 0 ), ( t ) must lie between the two roots, say ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), where ( x_1 < t < x_2 ).But wait, since ( m ) is positive, the product of the roots ( x_1 times x_2 = m ) is also positive. That means both roots are either positive or both are negative. However, the sum of the roots is ( x_1 + x_2 = -1 ) (from the quadratic formula), which is negative. So, both roots must be negative because their sum is negative and their product is positive. Therefore, ( x_1 < x_2 < 0 ).So, ( t ) is between two negative numbers, which means ( t ) itself must be negative. That makes sense because if ( t ) were positive, the function ( f(t) ) would be positive since the parabola opens upwards and the function tends to infinity as ( x ) increases.Now, I need to check if there's a zero in the interval ( (t, t+1) ). Since ( t ) is negative, ( t+1 ) could be either negative or positive depending on how negative ( t ) is. For example, if ( t = -0.5 ), then ( t+1 = 0.5 ), which is positive. If ( t = -2 ), then ( t+1 = -1 ), which is still negative.But regardless of whether ( t+1 ) is positive or negative, I can use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to check for a zero in the interval. The IVT states that if a function is continuous on an interval ([a, b]) and takes on values of opposite sign at ( a ) and ( b ), then there is at least one ( c ) in ( (a, b) ) where ( f(c) = 0 ).So, I need to evaluate ( f(t) ) and ( f(t+1) ). I know ( f(t) < 0 ). What about ( f(t+1) )?Let me compute ( f(t+1) ):( f(t+1) = (t+1)^2 + (t+1) + m )Expanding that:( f(t+1) = t^2 + 2t + 1 + t + 1 + m = t^2 + 3t + 2 + m )Hmm, so ( f(t+1) = t^2 + 3t + 2 + m ). Since ( m ) is positive, this adds to the value. But I'm not sure if this is positive or negative. Let me think.Since ( t ) is between the roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), which are both negative, ( t ) is negative. So, ( t+1 ) is either negative or positive, but ( f(t+1) ) is a quadratic function evaluated at ( t+1 ). Wait, maybe I can compare ( f(t+1) ) with ( f(t) ). Since ( f(t) < 0 ) and the function is a parabola opening upwards, moving to the right from ( t ) (i.e., increasing ( x )), the function will eventually become positive. So, if I move from ( t ) to ( t+1 ), which is a step to the right, the function might cross zero in that interval.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the behavior of ( f(x) ) as ( x ) increases. Since the parabola opens upwards, after the rightmost root ( x_2 ), the function becomes positive and stays positive. So, if ( t+1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) > 0 ). If ( t+1 ) is still less than ( x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) ) might still be negative.But wait, since ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and ( x_2 ) is the larger root (since both are negative), ( t+1 ) could potentially be greater than ( x_2 ) if ( t ) is close to ( x_2 ). For example, if ( t = x_2 - 0.5 ), then ( t+1 = x_2 + 0.5 ), which is definitely greater than ( x_2 ), so ( f(t+1) > 0 ).On the other hand, if ( t ) is far from ( x_2 ), say ( t = x_1 + 0.1 ), then ( t+1 = x_1 + 1.1 ), which might still be less than ( x_2 ) or greater, depending on the distance between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).Wait, but the distance between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) is determined by the discriminant. The discriminant of the quadratic is ( D = 1 - 4m ). Since ( m > 0 ), the discriminant is less than 1, so the roots are real and distinct only if ( D > 0 ), which would require ( 1 - 4m > 0 ) or ( m < 1/4 ). If ( m geq 1/4 ), the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis, meaning ( f(x) ) is always positive, which contradicts ( f(t) < 0 ). So, actually, for ( f(t) < 0 ) to hold, ( m ) must be less than ( 1/4 ).Therefore, ( m < 1/4 ), and the roots are real and distinct. So, ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are real, with ( x_1 < x_2 < 0 ).Now, going back to ( f(t+1) ). Since ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and ( x_2 ) is the larger root, ( t+1 ) could be either less than ( x_2 ) or greater than ( x_2 ). If ( t+1 > x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) > 0 ). If ( t+1 < x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) < 0 ).But wait, since ( x_2 ) is negative, ( t+1 ) could be either negative or positive. If ( t+1 ) is positive, then ( f(t+1) ) is definitely positive because the parabola opens upwards and ( f(0) = m > 0 ), and as ( x ) increases beyond 0, ( f(x) ) increases further.So, if ( t+1 geq 0 ), then ( f(t+1) > 0 ). If ( t+1 < 0 ), then ( f(t+1) ) could be positive or negative, depending on whether ( t+1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ) or not.But since ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and ( x_2 ) is negative, ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not. Let's see.Suppose ( t ) is very close to ( x_2 ). Then ( t+1 ) would be ( x_2 + 1 ), which is definitely greater than ( x_2 ), so ( f(t+1) > 0 ).If ( t ) is somewhere in the middle between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), then ( t+1 ) might still be less than ( x_2 ) or greater. But since ( x_2 ) is negative, adding 1 to ( t ) (which is also negative) might bring it closer to zero or even make it positive.Wait, let's consider specific examples to get a better intuition.Suppose ( m = 1/5 ), which is less than ( 1/4 ). Then the quadratic is ( x^2 + x + 1/5 ). The roots are:( x = [-1 pm sqrt{1 - 4*(1/5)}]/2 = [-1 pm sqrt{1 - 4/5}]/2 = [-1 pm sqrt{1/5}]/2 )So, approximately, ( sqrt{1/5} approx 0.447 ), so the roots are:( x_1 approx (-1 - 0.447)/2 approx -0.7235 )( x_2 approx (-1 + 0.447)/2 approx -0.2765 )So, ( x_1 approx -0.7235 ), ( x_2 approx -0.2765 ).Now, let's pick ( t = -0.5 ), which is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). Then ( t+1 = 0.5 ).Compute ( f(t) = (-0.5)^2 + (-0.5) + 0.2 = 0.25 - 0.5 + 0.2 = -0.05 ), which is less than 0, as expected.Compute ( f(t+1) = (0.5)^2 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.95 > 0 ).So, in this case, ( f(t) < 0 ) and ( f(t+1) > 0 ), so by IVT, there's a zero in ( (t, t+1) ).Another example: Let ( t = -0.3 ), which is still between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) (since ( x_2 approx -0.2765 )).Wait, actually, ( t = -0.3 ) is less than ( x_2 approx -0.2765 ), so ( t ) is still between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).Compute ( t+1 = 0.7 ).( f(t) = (-0.3)^2 + (-0.3) + 0.2 = 0.09 - 0.3 + 0.2 = -0.01 < 0 ).( f(t+1) = (0.7)^2 + 0.7 + 0.2 = 0.49 + 0.7 + 0.2 = 1.39 > 0 ).Again, ( f(t) < 0 ) and ( f(t+1) > 0 ), so IVT applies.Another case: Let ( t = -0.28 ), which is just slightly less than ( x_2 approx -0.2765 ). So, ( t = -0.28 ) is still between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).Compute ( t+1 = 0.72 ).( f(t) = (-0.28)^2 + (-0.28) + 0.2 = 0.0784 - 0.28 + 0.2 = -0.0016 < 0 ).( f(t+1) = (0.72)^2 + 0.72 + 0.2 = 0.5184 + 0.72 + 0.2 = 1.4384 > 0 ).Again, ( f(t) < 0 ) and ( f(t+1) > 0 ).Wait, what if ( t ) is very close to ( x_2 ), say ( t = x_2 - 0.01 ). Then ( t+1 = x_2 + 0.99 ). Since ( x_2 approx -0.2765 ), ( t+1 approx -0.2765 + 0.99 = 0.7135 ), which is positive, so ( f(t+1) > 0 ).Alternatively, suppose ( t ) is such that ( t+1 ) is still negative but greater than ( x_2 ). For example, let ( t = -0.3 ), ( t+1 = 0.7 ), which is positive. But if ( t = -1.5 ), which is less than ( x_1 approx -0.7235 ), then ( f(t) ) would be positive because ( t ) is to the left of ( x_1 ). But in our case, ( f(t) < 0 ), so ( t ) must be between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).Wait, if ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and ( x_2 ) is negative, then ( t+1 ) could be either negative or positive, but in any case, if ( t+1 ) is positive, ( f(t+1) ) is positive. If ( t+1 ) is still negative, is ( f(t+1) ) necessarily positive?Wait, no. If ( t+1 ) is still between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) ) would still be negative. But since ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and ( x_2 ) is negative, ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not.Wait, let's think about the distance between ( t ) and ( x_2 ). If ( t ) is such that ( t+1 > x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) > 0 ). If ( t+1 leq x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) leq 0 ). But since ( x_2 ) is negative, ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) even if it's still negative.Wait, but ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), so ( t < x_2 ). Therefore, ( t+1 < x_2 + 1 ). Since ( x_2 ) is negative, ( x_2 + 1 ) is less than 1 but greater than ( x_2 ). So, ( t+1 ) could be less than ( x_2 + 1 ), but whether it's greater than ( x_2 ) depends on how much ( t ) is.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), so ( x_1 < t < x_2 ). Then, ( t+1 ) is greater than ( t ), so ( t+1 > t ). Since ( t < x_2 ), ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not.If ( t+1 > x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) > 0 ). If ( t+1 leq x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) leq 0 ). But since ( x_2 ) is negative, ( t+1 ) could still be negative but greater than ( x_2 ).Wait, but ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), so ( t > x_1 ). Therefore, ( t+1 > x_1 + 1 ). Since ( x_1 ) is negative, ( x_1 + 1 ) is less than 1 but greater than ( x_1 ).But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I should think about the function's behavior.Since ( f(x) ) is a parabola opening upwards, it has a minimum at ( x = -b/(2a) = -1/2 ). So, the vertex is at ( x = -0.5 ). The function decreases from ( x = -infty ) to ( x = -0.5 ), and then increases from ( x = -0.5 ) to ( x = +infty ).Given that ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), which are both less than 0, and ( x_2 ) is greater than ( x_1 ). So, ( t ) is somewhere between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).If ( t ) is to the left of the vertex (( t < -0.5 )), then ( f(t) ) is decreasing as ( t ) increases towards the vertex. If ( t ) is to the right of the vertex (( t > -0.5 )), then ( f(t) ) is increasing as ( t ) increases.But regardless, since ( f(t) < 0 ), and ( f(x) ) tends to infinity as ( x ) increases, there must be a point where ( f(x) ) crosses zero after ( t ). The question is whether this crossing happens within ( (t, t+1) ).Wait, but how far is ( t ) from ( x_2 )? If ( t ) is very close to ( x_2 ), then ( t+1 ) is just a little more than ( x_2 + 1 ), which is still negative, but since ( x_2 ) is the rightmost root, ( f(x) ) becomes positive after ( x_2 ). So, if ( t+1 > x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) > 0 ).But if ( t+1 leq x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) leq 0 ). However, since ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and ( x_2 ) is negative, ( t+1 ) could be either side of ( x_2 ).Wait, but ( t ) is less than ( x_2 ), so ( t+1 ) is less than ( x_2 + 1 ). Since ( x_2 ) is negative, ( x_2 + 1 ) is less than 1 but greater than ( x_2 ). So, ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not.Wait, let's think numerically again. Suppose ( x_2 = -0.2765 ). If ( t = -0.3 ), then ( t+1 = 0.7 ), which is greater than ( x_2 ). If ( t = -0.28 ), ( t+1 = 0.72 ), still greater than ( x_2 ). If ( t = -0.2765 + epsilon ), where ( epsilon ) is a small positive number, then ( t+1 = -0.2765 + epsilon + 1 = 0.7235 + epsilon ), which is still greater than ( x_2 ).Wait, but if ( t ) is very close to ( x_2 ), say ( t = x_2 - delta ), where ( delta ) is a small positive number, then ( t+1 = x_2 - delta + 1 ). Since ( x_2 ) is negative, ( x_2 - delta ) is more negative, but ( t+1 ) is ( x_2 - delta + 1 ), which is ( (x_2 + 1) - delta ). Since ( x_2 + 1 ) is less than 1 but greater than ( x_2 ), and ( delta ) is small, ( t+1 ) is still greater than ( x_2 ).Wait, but ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), so ( t+1 = x_2 - delta + 1 = (x_2 + 1) - delta ). Since ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), and ( delta ) is small, ( t+1 ) is still greater than ( x_2 ).Wait, but if ( t ) is very close to ( x_2 ), say ( t = x_2 - 0.01 ), then ( t+1 = x_2 + 0.99 ). Since ( x_2 ) is negative, ( x_2 + 0.99 ) is still negative if ( x_2 > -0.99 ). Wait, but ( x_2 ) is approximately -0.2765, so ( x_2 + 0.99 approx 0.7135 ), which is positive.Wait, so in all cases where ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), ( t+1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), because ( x_2 ) is negative, and adding 1 to ( t ) (which is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 )) will make ( t+1 ) greater than ( x_2 ).Wait, is that always true? Let's see.Suppose ( x_2 = -a ), where ( a > 0 ). Then ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), so ( x_1 < t < x_2 = -a ). Then ( t+1 ) is between ( x_1 + 1 ) and ( -a + 1 ).Since ( x_1 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_1 ), and ( -a + 1 ) is greater than ( -a ). So, ( t+1 ) is greater than ( x_1 + 1 ) and less than ( -a + 1 ).But ( x_2 = -a ), so ( -a + 1 = x_2 + 1 ). Therefore, ( t+1 ) is between ( x_1 + 1 ) and ( x_2 + 1 ).But since ( x_1 < x_2 ), ( x_1 + 1 < x_2 + 1 ). So, ( t+1 ) is in ( (x_1 + 1, x_2 + 1) ).But ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), and since ( x_2 ) is negative, ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ). Therefore, ( t+1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ) only if ( t+1 > x_2 ).Wait, but ( t < x_2 ), so ( t+1 < x_2 + 1 ). So, ( t+1 ) could be less than or greater than ( x_2 ), depending on how much ( t ) is.Wait, no. Since ( t < x_2 ), adding 1 to both sides, ( t+1 < x_2 + 1 ). But ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), so ( t+1 ) is less than ( x_2 + 1 ), but could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not.Wait, let's think numerically again. If ( x_2 = -0.2765 ), then ( x_2 + 1 = 0.7235 ). So, ( t+1 ) is less than 0.7235, but ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) (which is -0.2765) or not.Wait, if ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), say ( t = -0.5 ), then ( t+1 = 0.5 ), which is greater than ( x_2 ). If ( t = -0.3 ), ( t+1 = 0.7 ), still greater than ( x_2 ). If ( t = -0.28 ), ( t+1 = 0.72 ), still greater than ( x_2 ).Wait, but if ( t ) is very close to ( x_2 ), say ( t = x_2 - 0.01 ), then ( t+1 = x_2 + 0.99 approx -0.2765 + 0.99 = 0.7135 ), which is still greater than ( x_2 ).Wait, so in all cases, ( t+1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), because ( t ) is less than ( x_2 ), and adding 1 to ( t ) makes it greater than ( x_2 ). Because ( x_2 ) is negative, adding 1 to ( t ) (which is less than ( x_2 )) will make ( t+1 ) greater than ( x_2 ).Wait, let me verify that. Suppose ( t < x_2 ). Then ( t+1 < x_2 + 1 ). But ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), so ( t+1 ) is less than ( x_2 + 1 ), but could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not.Wait, no. If ( t < x_2 ), then ( t+1 < x_2 + 1 ). But ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), so ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not, depending on how much ( t ) is.Wait, but ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), so ( t > x_1 ). Therefore, ( t+1 > x_1 + 1 ). Since ( x_1 ) is negative, ( x_1 + 1 ) is less than 1 but greater than ( x_1 ).But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I should think about the function's behavior.Since ( f(x) ) is negative between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and positive outside. So, if ( t+1 > x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) > 0 ). If ( t+1 leq x_2 ), then ( f(t+1) leq 0 ).But since ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and ( x_2 ) is negative, ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not.Wait, but ( t ) is less than ( x_2 ), so ( t+1 ) is less than ( x_2 + 1 ). Since ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), ( t+1 ) could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not.Wait, let's consider ( t = x_2 - delta ), where ( delta > 0 ). Then ( t+1 = x_2 - delta + 1 = (x_2 + 1) - delta ). Since ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), and ( delta ) is positive, ( t+1 ) is less than ( x_2 + 1 ) but could be greater than ( x_2 ) or not.Wait, but ( x_2 + 1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), so ( t+1 = x_2 + 1 - delta ). If ( delta < 1 ), then ( t+1 > x_2 ). If ( delta geq 1 ), then ( t+1 leq x_2 ).But ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), so ( t > x_1 ). Therefore, ( t = x_2 - delta ) implies ( x_2 - delta > x_1 ). Since ( x_1 < x_2 ), ( delta < x_2 - x_1 ).But ( x_2 - x_1 ) is the distance between the roots, which is ( sqrt{D}/a = sqrt{1 - 4m}/1 = sqrt{1 - 4m} ). Since ( m < 1/4 ), ( sqrt{1 - 4m} ) is less than 1. Therefore, ( delta < sqrt{1 - 4m} < 1 ).Therefore, ( delta < 1 ), so ( t+1 = x_2 + 1 - delta > x_2 + 1 - 1 = x_2 ). Therefore, ( t+1 > x_2 ).Wait, that's a key point. Since ( delta < 1 ), ( t+1 = x_2 + 1 - delta > x_2 + 1 - 1 = x_2 ). Therefore, ( t+1 > x_2 ).Therefore, ( t+1 > x_2 ), which means ( f(t+1) > 0 ).Therefore, regardless of where ( t ) is between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), ( t+1 ) is greater than ( x_2 ), so ( f(t+1) > 0 ).Therefore, since ( f(t) < 0 ) and ( f(t+1) > 0 ), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one zero in the interval ( (t, t+1) ).So, the conclusion is that there is at least one zero in the interval ( (t, t+1) )."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a common difference of d, if -frac{1}{2} < d < -frac{1}{3} and (a_1 - 1)^2 = (a_{11} - 1)^2, find the maximum value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms, S_n.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to parse it step by step. The sequence is denoted as {a_n}, and it has a common difference of d. The problem states that d is between -1/2 and -1/3, so that's a negative common difference, meaning the sequence is decreasing. Then, there's this equation given: (a‚ÇÅ - 1)¬≤ = (a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1)¬≤. I need to use this to find something about the sequence, and then figure out the maximum value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms, S_n.Okay, let's start by understanding what (a‚ÇÅ - 1)¬≤ = (a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1)¬≤ means. Since both sides are squared, it implies that either a‚ÇÅ - 1 equals a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1 or a‚ÇÅ - 1 equals -(a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1). So, two possibilities:1. a‚ÇÅ - 1 = a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 12. a‚ÇÅ - 1 = -(a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1)Let me explore both cases.Case 1: a‚ÇÅ - 1 = a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1If I subtract 1 from both sides, I get a‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ. But wait, in an arithmetic sequence, each term is the previous term plus the common difference d. So, a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÅ + 10d. If a‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ, then a‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÅ + 10d. Subtracting a‚ÇÅ from both sides gives 0 = 10d, which implies d = 0. But the problem says d is between -1/2 and -1/3, so d can't be zero. Therefore, this case is impossible.Case 2: a‚ÇÅ - 1 = -(a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1)Let me write that out:a‚ÇÅ - 1 = -a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ + 1Bring all terms to one side:a‚ÇÅ - 1 + a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1 = 0Simplify:a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 2 = 0So, a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ = 2But since a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÅ + 10d, substitute that in:a‚ÇÅ + (a‚ÇÅ + 10d) = 2Combine like terms:2a‚ÇÅ + 10d = 2Divide both sides by 2:a‚ÇÅ + 5d = 1So, a‚ÇÅ = 1 - 5dAlright, that gives me an expression for the first term in terms of d. So, a‚ÇÅ = 1 - 5d.Now, the general term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a‚ÇÅ + (n - 1)d. So, substituting a‚ÇÅ:a_n = (1 - 5d) + (n - 1)dSimplify that:a_n = 1 - 5d + nd - dCombine like terms:a_n = 1 - 6d + ndFactor out d:a_n = 1 + d(n - 6)Hmm, okay. So, each term is 1 plus d times (n - 6). Since d is negative, as n increases, a_n decreases, which makes sense because it's a decreasing sequence.Now, the sum of the first n terms, S_n, is given by the formula:S_n = (n/2)(a‚ÇÅ + a_n)Substitute a‚ÇÅ and a_n:S_n = (n/2)[(1 - 5d) + (1 + d(n - 6))]Simplify inside the brackets:(1 - 5d) + 1 + dn - 6d = 2 - 11d + dnSo,S_n = (n/2)(2 - 11d + dn)Let me write that as:S_n = (n/2)(dn + 2 - 11d)Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of n. Let me rearrange it:S_n = (n/2)(dn + (2 - 11d)) = (d/2)n¬≤ + (2 - 11d)/2 * nSo, S_n is a quadratic function of n: S_n = An¬≤ + Bn, where A = d/2 and B = (2 - 11d)/2.Since d is negative, A is negative, so the parabola opens downward. That means the maximum occurs at the vertex.The vertex of a parabola given by An¬≤ + Bn is at n = -B/(2A). Let me compute that.First, compute -B/(2A):A = d/2, so 2A = dB = (2 - 11d)/2, so -B = (-2 + 11d)/2Therefore,n = (-B)/(2A) = [(-2 + 11d)/2] / d = (-2 + 11d)/(2d)Simplify:n = (-2)/(2d) + (11d)/(2d) = (-1)/d + 11/2So,n = 11/2 - 1/dGiven that d is between -1/2 and -1/3, let's find the range of 1/d.Since d is negative, 1/d is also negative. So, 1/d is between -2 and -3 because:If d = -1/2, 1/d = -2If d = -1/3, 1/d = -3But since d is between -1/2 and -1/3, 1/d is between -3 and -2.So, 1/d is in (-3, -2)Therefore, -1/d is in (2, 3)So, n = 11/2 - 1/d11/2 is 5.5, so n = 5.5 - (something between 2 and 3)So, n is between 5.5 - 3 = 2.5 and 5.5 - 2 = 3.5Therefore, n is between 2.5 and 3.5.But n has to be an integer because it's the number of terms. So, n can be 3.Wait, but hold on. The maximum of the quadratic occurs at n ‚âà 2.5 to 3.5, so the integer n that is closest to the vertex is either 3 or maybe 2 or 3.But wait, in the original problem, we need to find the maximum value of n that maximizes S_n. So, S_n is a quadratic function, and since it's opening downward, the maximum is at the vertex. So, the maximum occurs around n ‚âà 2.5 to 3.5.But n must be an integer, so we need to check n=3 and n=2 to see which gives a higher sum.Wait, but let's think again. The vertex is at n = 11/2 - 1/d, which is 5.5 - 1/d. Since 1/d is between -3 and -2, so n is between 5.5 - (-3) = 8.5 and 5.5 - (-2) = 7.5? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the substitution.Wait, n = 11/2 - 1/d.Given that 1/d is between -3 and -2, so -1/d is between 2 and 3.So, n = 5.5 + (something between 2 and 3). Wait, no:Wait, n = 11/2 - 1/d.Since 1/d is negative, subtracting a negative is adding a positive.So, n = 5.5 + |1/d|, where |1/d| is between 2 and 3.So, n is between 5.5 + 2 = 7.5 and 5.5 + 3 = 8.5.Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which one is correct?Wait, let's re-examine:n = 11/2 - 1/d.Given that d is between -1/2 and -1/3, so 1/d is between -2 and -3.Therefore, -1/d is between 2 and 3.So, n = 5.5 + (something between 2 and 3). So, n is between 5.5 + 2 = 7.5 and 5.5 + 3 = 8.5.Wait, so n is between 7.5 and 8.5.But n must be an integer, so n can be 8.But wait, in the initial problem, the user's answer was 2, but according to this, it's 8.Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check my steps.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the vertex.Wait, the quadratic is S_n = (d/2)n¬≤ + (2 - 11d)/2 * nSo, A = d/2, B = (2 - 11d)/2Then, vertex at n = -B/(2A) = [-(2 - 11d)/2] / (2*(d/2)) = [(-2 + 11d)/2] / d = (-2 + 11d)/(2d)Which is equal to (-2)/(2d) + (11d)/(2d) = (-1)/d + 11/2So, n = 11/2 - 1/dYes, that's correct.Given that d is between -1/2 and -1/3, 1/d is between -2 and -3, so -1/d is between 2 and 3.Therefore, n = 5.5 + (2 to 3) = 7.5 to 8.5.So, n is approximately 8.But wait, in the initial problem, the assistant concluded n=2. That seems conflicting.Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula.Wait, let me think again.Wait, the formula for the vertex is n = -B/(2A). So, A = d/2, B = (2 - 11d)/2.So, n = -(2 - 11d)/2 divided by (2*(d/2)) = -(2 - 11d)/2 divided by d = (-2 + 11d)/(2d)Which is equal to (-2)/(2d) + (11d)/(2d) = (-1)/d + 11/2.Yes, that's correct.So, n = 11/2 - 1/d.Given that d is between -1/2 and -1/3, so 1/d is between -2 and -3.Thus, -1/d is between 2 and 3.Therefore, n = 5.5 + (2 to 3) = 7.5 to 8.5.So, n is between 7.5 and 8.5, so the integer n that is closest is 8.But wait, in the initial problem, the assistant concluded n=2.Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check the initial problem again.Wait, the problem says: \\"find the maximum value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms, S_n.\\"So, if n is around 8, then 8 is the maximum n. But the assistant's answer was 2.Wait, maybe the assistant made a mistake.Wait, let me think again.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for S_n.Let me rederive S_n.Given that a_n = 1 + d(n - 6)So, S_n = sum_{k=1}^n a_k = sum_{k=1}^n [1 + d(k - 6)]Which is sum_{k=1}^n 1 + d sum_{k=1}^n (k - 6)Compute the first sum: sum_{k=1}^n 1 = nCompute the second sum: d sum_{k=1}^n (k - 6) = d [sum_{k=1}^n k - 6n] = d [n(n + 1)/2 - 6n] = d [ (n¬≤ + n)/2 - 6n ] = d [ (n¬≤ + n - 12n)/2 ] = d [ (n¬≤ - 11n)/2 ]So, S_n = n + d*(n¬≤ - 11n)/2So, S_n = n + (d/2)n¬≤ - (11d/2)nCombine like terms:S_n = (d/2)n¬≤ + (1 - (11d)/2)nSo, that's the same as before: S_n = (d/2)n¬≤ + (2 - 11d)/2 * nSo, that's correct.Therefore, the vertex is at n = -B/(2A) = [-(2 - 11d)/2] / (2*(d/2)) = [(-2 + 11d)/2] / d = (-2 + 11d)/(2d) = (-1)/d + 11/2So, n = 11/2 - 1/dGiven that d is between -1/2 and -1/3, so 1/d is between -2 and -3.Thus, n = 5.5 - 1/dBut since 1/d is negative, subtracting a negative is adding.So, n = 5.5 + |1/d|Since |1/d| is between 2 and 3, n is between 7.5 and 8.5.Therefore, the maximum occurs around n=8.But wait, the assistant's answer was 2. That seems way off.Wait, perhaps the assistant made a mistake in the initial steps.Looking back at the initial problem:The assistant wrote:Since (a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1)^2 = (a‚ÇÅ - 1)^2, we have:(a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1 + a‚ÇÅ - 1)(a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1 - a‚ÇÅ + 1) = 0,(12a‚ÇÅ + 10d - 2)10d = 0,12a‚ÇÅ + 10d - 2 = 0,a‚ÇÅ = (1 - 5d)/6,a_n = (1 - 5d)/6 + (n - 1)d = 1/6 + (n - 11/6)d.Wait, that seems different from my derivation.Wait, in my derivation, I had a_n = 1 + d(n - 6), but the assistant has a_n = 1/6 + (n - 11/6)d.Wait, let me check.From the assistant's steps:They started with (a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1)^2 = (a‚ÇÅ - 1)^2, which implies either a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1 = a‚ÇÅ - 1 or a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ - 1 = -(a‚ÇÅ - 1).They considered the second case, leading to a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ = 2.Then, since a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÅ + 10d, so 2a‚ÇÅ + 10d = 2, leading to a‚ÇÅ = (1 - 5d)/6.Wait, hold on, that seems incorrect.Wait, 2a‚ÇÅ + 10d = 2 => a‚ÇÅ = (2 - 10d)/2 = 1 - 5d.But the assistant wrote a‚ÇÅ = (1 - 5d)/6. That seems incorrect.Wait, that's a mistake. Because 2a‚ÇÅ + 10d = 2 => a‚ÇÅ = (2 - 10d)/2 = 1 - 5d.So, the assistant incorrectly divided by 6 instead of 2. That's a critical error.Therefore, their subsequent steps are wrong.So, the correct a‚ÇÅ is 1 - 5d, not (1 - 5d)/6.Therefore, their expression for a_n is wrong.So, that explains why their conclusion was n=2, which is incorrect.So, in my derivation, a‚ÇÅ = 1 - 5d, which is correct, leading to a_n = 1 + d(n - 6), which is correct.Therefore, the correct vertex is at n ‚âà 8, so n=8.But wait, let me think again.Wait, the problem is to find the maximum value of n that maximizes S_n.But in an arithmetic sequence with negative common difference, the terms are decreasing. So, the sum S_n will increase initially, reach a maximum, and then start decreasing as the negative terms dominate.Therefore, the maximum sum occurs at the point where the terms are still positive or zero.So, perhaps another approach is to find when the terms a_n are non-negative, because once a_n becomes negative, adding more terms will decrease the sum.So, let's find the value of n where a_n = 0.Given a_n = 1 + d(n - 6) = 0So,1 + d(n - 6) = 0=> d(n - 6) = -1=> n - 6 = -1/d=> n = 6 - 1/dGiven that d is between -1/2 and -1/3, so 1/d is between -2 and -3, so -1/d is between 2 and 3.Therefore, n = 6 + (2 to 3) = 8 to 9.So, n is between 8 and 9.Therefore, the last positive term is at n=8 or n=9.But since n must be integer, the maximum n where a_n is non-negative is n=8 or n=9.But let's compute a_8 and a_9.Compute a_8:a_8 = 1 + d(8 - 6) = 1 + 2dSimilarly, a_9 = 1 + d(9 - 6) = 1 + 3dGiven that d is between -1/2 and -1/3.Compute a_8:1 + 2d.Since d > -1/2, 2d > -1, so 1 + 2d > 0.Similarly, d < -1/3, so 2d < -2/3, so 1 + 2d < 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.So, a_8 is positive.Compute a_9:1 + 3d.Since d > -1/2, 3d > -3/2, so 1 + 3d > 1 - 3/2 = -1/2.But d < -1/3, so 3d < -1, so 1 + 3d < 0.Therefore, a_9 is negative.Therefore, the last positive term is a_8.Therefore, the sum S_n will be maximized at n=8, because adding a_9 would decrease the sum.Therefore, the maximum n is 8.Wait, but earlier, the vertex was at n ‚âà 8.5, so n=8 is the integer before the vertex, and n=9 is after.But since a_9 is negative, adding it would decrease the sum.Therefore, the maximum sum occurs at n=8.So, the answer should be 8.But wait, in my earlier calculation, the vertex is at n ‚âà 8.5, so the maximum sum is between n=8 and n=9.But since n must be integer, we can check S_8 and S_9.But since a_9 is negative, S_9 = S_8 + a_9 < S_8.Therefore, S_8 is the maximum.Therefore, the maximum value of n is 8.But wait, in the initial problem, the assistant concluded n=2, which is way off.So, I think the correct answer is 8.But let me verify with specific values.Let me pick a d in the given range, say d = -0.4, which is between -1/2 and -1/3.Compute a‚ÇÅ = 1 - 5d = 1 - 5*(-0.4) = 1 + 2 = 3.So, a‚ÇÅ = 3.Compute a_n = 3 + (n - 1)(-0.4) = 3 - 0.4(n - 1)Compute S_n = (n/2)(a‚ÇÅ + a_n) = (n/2)(3 + [3 - 0.4(n - 1)]) = (n/2)(6 - 0.4(n - 1)) = (n/2)(6 - 0.4n + 0.4) = (n/2)(6.4 - 0.4n) = 3.2n - 0.2n¬≤So, S_n = -0.2n¬≤ + 3.2nThis is a quadratic with vertex at n = -B/(2A) = -3.2/(2*(-0.2)) = -3.2/(-0.4) = 8So, the vertex is at n=8, which is an integer, so S_8 is the maximum.Compute S_8: -0.2*(64) + 3.2*8 = -12.8 + 25.6 = 12.8Compute S_9: -0.2*(81) + 3.2*9 = -16.2 + 28.8 = 12.6So, indeed, S_8 > S_9, so maximum at n=8.Similarly, let's pick another d, say d = -0.35.Compute a‚ÇÅ = 1 - 5*(-0.35) = 1 + 1.75 = 2.75Compute a_n = 2.75 + (n - 1)(-0.35) = 2.75 - 0.35(n - 1)Compute S_n = (n/2)(2.75 + [2.75 - 0.35(n - 1)]) = (n/2)(5.5 - 0.35(n - 1)) = (n/2)(5.5 - 0.35n + 0.35) = (n/2)(5.85 - 0.35n) = 2.925n - 0.175n¬≤Vertex at n = -B/(2A) = -2.925/(2*(-0.175)) = -2.925/(-0.35) ‚âà 8.357So, around n=8.357, so maximum at n=8.Compute S_8: 2.925*8 - 0.175*64 = 23.4 - 11.2 = 12.2Compute S_9: 2.925*9 - 0.175*81 = 26.325 - 14.175 = 12.15Again, S_8 > S_9.Therefore, the maximum occurs at n=8.Therefore, the correct answer is 8.But the initial assistant's answer was 2, which is incorrect because they made a mistake in solving for a‚ÇÅ.So, in conclusion, the maximum value of n that maximizes S_n is 8."},{"question":"Distinct points A, B, C, D lie on the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=16 and have integer coordinates.

The distances AB and CD are irrational numbers, and I need to find the greatest possible value of the ratio AB/CD. The options given are A) 1/‚àö2, B) 1, C) ‚àö2, D) 2, and E) ‚àö3.First, I need to figure out what points on the circle x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 16 have integer coordinates. Since the radius is 4, the possible integer coordinates would be points where both x and y are integers such that their squares add up to 16. Let me list them out.The circle equation is x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 16. So, the integer solutions for (x, y) would be:- (4, 0), (-4, 0), (0, 4), (0, -4)- (2, 2‚àö3), but wait, that's not integer. Hmm, maybe (2, 2) and (-2, 2), etc. Let me check:Wait, 2¬≤ + 2¬≤ = 4 + 4 = 8, which is less than 16. So that's not on the circle. Wait, maybe (2, 2‚àö3) is not integer. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me think again. The radius is 4, so x and y can be from -4 to 4. Let me list all integer points (x, y) such that x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 16.Possible x values: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.For each x, check if y¬≤ = 16 - x¬≤ is a perfect square.- x = 0: y¬≤ = 16, so y = ¬±4. So points (0,4) and (0,-4).- x = ¬±1: y¬≤ = 16 - 1 = 15, which is not a perfect square. So no points here.- x = ¬±2: y¬≤ = 16 - 4 = 12, which is not a perfect square. So no points here.- x = ¬±3: y¬≤ = 16 - 9 = 7, which is not a perfect square. So no points here.- x = ¬±4: y¬≤ = 16 - 16 = 0, so y = 0. So points (4,0) and (-4,0).Wait, so the only integer points on the circle are (4,0), (-4,0), (0,4), and (0,-4). That's only four points. But the problem says four distinct points A, B, C, D. So, are these the only points? That seems limited.But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.Wait, 2¬≤ + 2¬≤ = 8, which is less than 16, so that's inside the circle. But maybe there are other points where x and y are integers but not just 0, 4, or -4.Wait, let me think differently. Maybe points like (2, 2‚àö3) are on the circle, but since ‚àö3 is irrational, those points don't have integer coordinates. So, perhaps the only integer-coordinate points on the circle are the four I listed: (4,0), (-4,0), (0,4), (0,-4).But that seems too few. Let me check for x = ¬±2, y¬≤ = 16 - 4 = 12, which is not a perfect square. So no. Similarly, x = ¬±1, y¬≤ = 15, not a perfect square. So, yes, only four points.Wait, but the problem says four distinct points A, B, C, D. So, if there are only four points, then A, B, C, D must be these four points. But then, the distances AB and CD would be between these points.Wait, but let's compute the distances between these points.The points are (4,0), (-4,0), (0,4), (0,-4).Compute distance between (4,0) and (-4,0): that's 8 units, which is rational.Distance between (4,0) and (0,4): sqrt((4-0)^2 + (0-4)^2) = sqrt(16 + 16) = sqrt(32) = 4‚àö2, which is irrational.Similarly, distance between (4,0) and (0,-4): same as above, 4‚àö2.Distance between (-4,0) and (0,4): same as above, 4‚àö2.Distance between (-4,0) and (0,-4): same, 4‚àö2.Distance between (0,4) and (0,-4): 8 units, rational.So, the only irrational distances are 4‚àö2, and the rational distances are 8.But the problem says that AB and CD are irrational. So, AB and CD must be 4‚àö2 each.Therefore, the ratio AB/CD would be (4‚àö2)/(4‚àö2) = 1.But wait, the options include 1, which is option B. So, is the answer 1?But wait, the problem says \\"the greatest possible value of the ratio AB/CD\\". If AB and CD are both 4‚àö2, then the ratio is 1. But is there a way to have AB larger and CD smaller, so that the ratio is larger than 1?Wait, but if all the irrational distances are 4‚àö2, then both AB and CD are 4‚àö2, so the ratio is 1. There's no way to have a larger AB or smaller CD because all the irrational distances are the same.Wait, but maybe I missed some points. Let me check again.Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think about points where x and y are integers, but not just 0, 4, or -4. For example, (2, 2) is inside the circle, but not on it. Similarly, (2, 3) would be sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13), which is less than 4, so inside. Wait, but maybe (2, 2‚àö3) is on the circle, but that's not integer.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that only (4,0), (-4,0), (0,4), (0,-4) are the integer points on the circle. Let me check for x = ¬±2, y¬≤ = 16 - 4 = 12, which is not a perfect square. So no points there. Similarly, x = ¬±1, y¬≤ = 15, not a perfect square. So, yes, only four points.Therefore, the only irrational distances are 4‚àö2, so AB and CD must both be 4‚àö2, making the ratio 1.Wait, but the problem says \\"greatest possible value\\". Maybe there's a way to have AB larger and CD smaller, but given that all irrational distances are the same, it's not possible.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed some points. Let me check for x = ¬±3, y¬≤ = 16 - 9 = 7, which is not a perfect square. So no points there.Wait, maybe I should consider points like (2, 2), but that's inside the circle, not on it. So, no.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the answer is 1, which is option B.But wait, let me think again. Maybe there are more points. Let me check for x = ¬±4, y = 0, which are on the circle. Similarly, x = 0, y = ¬±4.Wait, but what about points like (2, 2‚àö3)? That's on the circle, but y is not integer. So, no.Wait, maybe I should consider that the problem allows for points like (2, 2), but that's inside the circle, not on it. So, no.Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the circle equation again. x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 16. So, integer solutions are (x, y) where x and y are integers, and x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 16.So, possible x values: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.For each x, compute y¬≤ = 16 - x¬≤, and see if it's a perfect square.x = 0: y¬≤ = 16 ‚Üí y = ¬±4.x = ¬±1: y¬≤ = 15 ‚Üí not a square.x = ¬±2: y¬≤ = 12 ‚Üí not a square.x = ¬±3: y¬≤ = 7 ‚Üí not a square.x = ¬±4: y¬≤ = 0 ‚Üí y = 0.So, only four points: (4,0), (-4,0), (0,4), (0,-4).Therefore, the only possible distances between these points are either 8 (diameter) or 4‚àö2 (distance between (4,0) and (0,4), etc.).Since AB and CD are irrational, they must be 4‚àö2 each. Therefore, the ratio AB/CD is 1.So, the answer should be B) 1.Wait, but the problem says \\"greatest possible value\\". Is there a way to have AB larger and CD smaller? But since all irrational distances are the same, it's not possible. So, the ratio can't be more than 1.Therefore, the answer is 1, which is option B."},{"question":"Simplify sqrt{3 cdot 5} cdot sqrt{5^3 cdot 3^3}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem to simplify the expression ‚àö(3¬∑5) multiplied by ‚àö(5¬≥¬∑3¬≥). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you multiply square roots, you can combine them under a single square root. So, maybe I can use that property here.First, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right: ‚àö(3¬∑5) ¬∑ ‚àö(5¬≥¬∑3¬≥). Alright, so both terms are square roots, and I can combine them. That means I can write this as a single square root of the product inside. So, that would be ‚àö[(3¬∑5) ¬∑ (5¬≥¬∑3¬≥)]. Let me make sure I did that correctly. Yes, because ‚àöa ¬∑ ‚àöb = ‚àö(a¬∑b), so that seems right.Now, let's simplify the expression inside the square root. I have (3¬∑5) multiplied by (5¬≥¬∑3¬≥). I can rearrange the multiplication because multiplication is commutative, right? So, I can group the 3s together and the 5s together. That would give me (3¬∑3¬≥) ¬∑ (5¬∑5¬≥). Hmm, okay, so 3 times 3 cubed is 3 to the power of 1 plus 3, which is 3‚Å¥. Similarly, 5 times 5 cubed is 5‚Å¥. So, now the expression inside the square root is 3‚Å¥¬∑5‚Å¥.So, now I have ‚àö(3‚Å¥¬∑5‚Å¥). I remember that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, so I can separate these. That would be ‚àö(3‚Å¥) ¬∑ ‚àö(5‚Å¥). Now, the square root of 3‚Å¥ is 3^(4/2) which is 3¬≤, and similarly, the square root of 5‚Å¥ is 5¬≤. So, that simplifies to 3¬≤¬∑5¬≤.Calculating those exponents, 3 squared is 9 and 5 squared is 25. So, now I have 9¬∑25. Multiplying those together, 9 times 25 is 225. So, the simplified form of the original expression is 225.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning: ‚àö(3¬∑5) is ‚àö15, and ‚àö(5¬≥¬∑3¬≥) is ‚àö(125¬∑27). Multiplying those together gives ‚àö15¬∑‚àö125¬∑‚àö27. Wait, is that the same as ‚àö(15¬∑125¬∑27)? Yes, because ‚àöa¬∑‚àöb¬∑‚àöc = ‚àö(a¬∑b¬∑c). So, 15¬∑125¬∑27. Let me calculate that: 15 times 125 is 1875, and 1875 times 27. Hmm, 1875 times 27. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 1875 times 20 is 37,500, and 1875 times 7 is 13,125. Adding those together, 37,500 plus 13,125 is 50,625. So, the product inside the square root is 50,625.Now, taking the square root of 50,625. Let me see, what number squared gives 50,625? Well, I know that 225 squared is 50,625 because 200 squared is 40,000 and 25 squared is 625, and 225 squared is (200 + 25)¬≤ which is 200¬≤ + 2¬∑200¬∑25 + 25¬≤ = 40,000 + 10,000 + 625 = 50,625. So, ‚àö50,625 is indeed 225. That confirms my earlier result.Alternatively, I could have approached the problem by simplifying each square root separately before multiplying. Let's try that method as a check. Starting with ‚àö(3¬∑5), which is ‚àö15. Then, ‚àö(5¬≥¬∑3¬≥). I can write 5¬≥ as 5¬≤¬∑5 and 3¬≥ as 3¬≤¬∑3. So, ‚àö(5¬≤¬∑5¬∑3¬≤¬∑3). Then, I can take the square roots of the squared terms out of the radical. That would be ‚àö(5¬≤)¬∑‚àö(3¬≤)¬∑‚àö(5¬∑3) which is 5¬∑3¬∑‚àö15. So, that's 15¬∑‚àö15.Now, multiplying the two simplified terms: ‚àö15 ¬∑ 15¬∑‚àö15. That is 15¬∑(‚àö15¬∑‚àö15). Since ‚àö15¬∑‚àö15 is 15, this becomes 15¬∑15, which is 225. So, again, I get 225 as the simplified result.Wait, so both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything important. First, I recognized that multiplying square roots allows me to combine them under a single square root. Then, I simplified the exponents by adding them when multiplying like bases. After that, I took the square root of each term separately, which gave me the final numerical value.Alternatively, by simplifying each square root first, I was able to factor out perfect squares and then multiply the remaining terms, again leading to the same result. It's good to see that both approaches converge to the same answer, which suggests that 225 is indeed the correct simplification.I think I've covered all the necessary steps and checked my work using two different methods. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the simplified form of the original expression is 225."},{"question":"Given a function f(x) with domain in mathbb{R} that satisfies: f(x) = f(x-y) + f(y) + f(0), and when x > 0, f(x) < 0. <br/> (1) Prove the monotonicity of the function f(x) on its domain;<br/> (2) Prove the parity of the function f(x) on its domain;<br/> (3) If there exists x in (1,2) such that the inequality f(x^{2}-ax) + f(x-3) > 0 holds, find the range of real number a.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a function ( f(x) ) with some specific properties. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The function is defined for all real numbers, and it satisfies the equation ( f(x) = f(x - y) + f(y) + f(0) ) for any real numbers ( x ) and ( y ). Also, it's given that when ( x > 0 ), ( f(x) < 0 ). The problem has three parts: first, I need to prove the monotonicity of ( f(x) ), which means figuring out if it's increasing or decreasing. Second, I have to determine the parity of the function, meaning whether it's even, odd, or neither. Third, there's an inequality involving ( f(x^2 - ax) + f(x - 3) > 0 ) for some ( x ) in the interval ( (1, 2) ), and I need to find the range of real numbers ( a ) that satisfy this condition.Starting with part (1), proving monotonicity. The function equation is ( f(x) = f(x - y) + f(y) + f(0) ). I wonder if I can choose specific values for ( x ) and ( y ) to simplify this equation. Maybe setting ( x = y = 0 ) would help. Let's try that:If ( x = y = 0 ), then the equation becomes:[ f(0) = f(0 - 0) + f(0) + f(0) ]Simplifying, that's:[ f(0) = f(0) + f(0) + f(0) ]Which is:[ f(0) = 3f(0) ]Subtracting ( f(0) ) from both sides:[ 0 = 2f(0) ]So, ( f(0) = 0 ).Okay, that's useful. Now, plugging ( f(0) = 0 ) back into the original equation:[ f(x) = f(x - y) + f(y) ]This looks similar to Cauchy's functional equation, which is ( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) ). But here, it's ( f(x) = f(x - y) + f(y) ). Maybe I can rearrange it to resemble Cauchy's equation.Let me set ( z = x - y ). Then, ( x = z + y ), and substituting back:[ f(z + y) = f(z) + f(y) ]So, this is indeed Cauchy's functional equation. The general solution to Cauchy's equation is linear, ( f(x) = kx ), assuming some regularity conditions like monotonicity or continuity, which we might be able to infer from the given conditions.But wait, the problem states that for ( x > 0 ), ( f(x) < 0 ). If ( f(x) = kx ), then ( k ) must be negative because when ( x > 0 ), ( f(x) < 0 ). So, ( k < 0 ). That would make ( f(x) ) a linear function with a negative slope, which is monotonically decreasing.But I need to formally prove the monotonicity without assuming the form of ( f(x) ). Let's see. Since ( f(x) = f(x - y) + f(y) ), I can write this as:[ f(x) - f(y) = f(x - y) ]If I let ( x = x_1 ) and ( y = x_2 ), then:[ f(x_1) - f(x_2) = f(x_1 - x_2) ]Now, suppose ( x_1 > x_2 ). Then, ( x_1 - x_2 > 0 ), and by the given condition, ( f(x_1 - x_2) < 0 ). Therefore:[ f(x_1) - f(x_2) < 0 ]Which implies:[ f(x_1) < f(x_2) ]So, whenever ( x_1 > x_2 ), ( f(x_1) < f(x_2) ). That means ( f(x) ) is monotonically decreasing on ( mathbb{R} ).Alright, that takes care of part (1). Moving on to part (2), proving the parity of ( f(x) ). Parity refers to whether the function is even or odd. An even function satisfies ( f(-x) = f(x) ), and an odd function satisfies ( f(-x) = -f(x) ).Given the functional equation ( f(x) = f(x - y) + f(y) ), let's try setting ( x = 0 ). Then:[ f(0) = f(0 - y) + f(y) ]But we already know ( f(0) = 0 ), so:[ 0 = f(-y) + f(y) ]Which simplifies to:[ f(-y) = -f(y) ]This is precisely the definition of an odd function. Therefore, ( f(x) ) is an odd function.Great, part (2) is done. Now, part (3) is a bit more involved. We need to find the range of real numbers ( a ) such that there exists an ( x ) in the interval ( (1, 2) ) for which:[ f(x^2 - ax) + f(x - 3) > 0 ]Given that ( f(x) ) is odd and monotonically decreasing, let's see how we can use these properties. Since ( f ) is odd, ( f(-y) = -f(y) ). Also, since ( f ) is monotonically decreasing, if ( u < v ), then ( f(u) > f(v) ).First, let's analyze the arguments of the function ( f ). The first argument is ( x^2 - ax ), and the second is ( x - 3 ).Given ( x in (1, 2) ), let's evaluate ( x - 3 ). Since ( x ) is between 1 and 2, ( x - 3 ) is between ( -2 ) and ( -1 ). So, ( x - 3 ) is negative, which means ( f(x - 3) = f(-(3 - x)) = -f(3 - x) ) because ( f ) is odd.Similarly, ( x^2 - ax ) can be positive or negative depending on the value of ( a ). Let's denote ( u = x^2 - ax ). We need to consider the sign of ( u ) because ( f(u) ) will be positive or negative accordingly.But wait, ( f(x) ) is negative for ( x > 0 ) and positive for ( x < 0 ) because it's an odd function. So, ( f(u) ) will be negative if ( u > 0 ) and positive if ( u < 0 ).Given that, let's rewrite the inequality:[ f(x^2 - ax) + f(x - 3) > 0 ]Since ( x - 3 < 0 ), ( f(x - 3) = -f(3 - x) ). So, substituting:[ f(x^2 - ax) - f(3 - x) > 0 ]Which can be rearranged as:[ f(x^2 - ax) > f(3 - x) ]Now, since ( f ) is monotonically decreasing, the inequality ( f(u) > f(v) ) implies ( u < v ). Therefore:[ x^2 - ax < 3 - x ]Let's solve this inequality for ( a ):[ x^2 - ax < 3 - x ]Bring all terms to one side:[ x^2 - ax - 3 + x < 0 ]Combine like terms:[ x^2 + ( -a + 1 )x - 3 < 0 ]Let's write this as:[ x^2 + (1 - a)x - 3 < 0 ]This is a quadratic inequality in terms of ( x ). For this inequality to hold for some ( x in (1, 2) ), the quadratic must be negative in that interval. Let's denote the quadratic as:[ Q(x) = x^2 + (1 - a)x - 3 ]We need ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x in (1, 2) ). To find the range of ( a ), we can analyze the behavior of ( Q(x) ) over the interval ( (1, 2) ).First, let's find the roots of the quadratic equation ( Q(x) = 0 ):[ x^2 + (1 - a)x - 3 = 0 ]Using the quadratic formula:[ x = frac{-(1 - a) pm sqrt{(1 - a)^2 + 12}}{2} ]Simplify the discriminant:[ D = (1 - a)^2 + 12 = a^2 - 2a + 1 + 12 = a^2 - 2a + 13 ]Since ( D ) is always positive (as ( a^2 - 2a + 13 ) is a quadratic in ( a ) with discriminant ( 4 - 52 = -48 < 0 )), the quadratic has two real roots for any ( a ).Let's denote the roots as ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), where ( x_1 < x_2 ). The quadratic ( Q(x) ) opens upwards (since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive), so ( Q(x) < 0 ) between its roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).We need ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x in (1, 2) ). This means that the interval ( (1, 2) ) must overlap with the interval ( (x_1, x_2) ). Therefore, at least one of the following must be true:1. ( x_1 < 1 ) and ( x_2 > 1 )2. ( x_1 < 2 ) and ( x_2 > 2 )3. ( x_1 < 1 ) and ( x_2 > 2 )But since ( Q(x) ) is negative between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and we need this to overlap with ( (1, 2) ), the most straightforward condition is that ( x_1 < 2 ) and ( x_2 > 1 ). However, to ensure that there's some overlap, it's sufficient that ( Q(1) < 0 ) or ( Q(2) < 0 ), but actually, since ( Q(x) ) is continuous, if ( Q(1) < 0 ) or ( Q(2) < 0 ), there must be some ( x ) in ( (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) < 0 ).Wait, but actually, if ( Q(1) < 0 ) or ( Q(2) < 0 ), it doesn't necessarily mean that ( Q(x) < 0 ) somewhere in between. It could be that ( Q(1) < 0 ) and ( Q(2) > 0 ), meaning the quadratic crosses from negative to positive within ( (1, 2) ), ensuring that ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x ) in ( (1, 2) ).Alternatively, if ( Q(1) < 0 ) and ( Q(2) < 0 ), then the entire interval ( (1, 2) ) is within the roots, meaning ( Q(x) < 0 ) for all ( x in (1, 2) ).But to find the range of ( a ) such that there exists at least one ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) < 0 ), we can consider the conditions on ( Q(1) ) and ( Q(2) ).Let's compute ( Q(1) ) and ( Q(2) ):- ( Q(1) = 1 + (1 - a)(1) - 3 = 1 + 1 - a - 3 = -1 - a )- ( Q(2) = 4 + (1 - a)(2) - 3 = 4 + 2 - 2a - 3 = 3 - 2a )We need either ( Q(1) < 0 ) or ( Q(2) < 0 ), or that ( Q(x) ) crosses zero within ( (1, 2) ).But actually, since ( Q(x) ) is continuous, if ( Q(1) < 0 ) and ( Q(2) > 0 ), there must be some ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) = 0 ), and hence ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x ) in ( (1, 2) ).Similarly, if ( Q(1) < 0 ) and ( Q(2) < 0 ), then ( Q(x) < 0 ) for all ( x in (1, 2) ).So, let's set up the conditions:1. ( Q(1) < 0 ): ( -1 - a < 0 ) ‚Üí ( a > -1 )2. ( Q(2) < 0 ): ( 3 - 2a < 0 ) ‚Üí ( a > 3/2 )But we need to consider the cases where either ( Q(1) < 0 ) or ( Q(2) < 0 ), or that ( Q(x) ) crosses zero in ( (1, 2) ).Wait, actually, if ( Q(1) < 0 ) and ( Q(2) > 0 ), then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is some ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) = 0 ), and thus ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x ) in ( (1, 2) ).Similarly, if ( Q(1) < 0 ) and ( Q(2) < 0 ), then ( Q(x) < 0 ) for all ( x in (1, 2) ).If ( Q(1) > 0 ) and ( Q(2) < 0 ), then again, there's some ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) = 0 ), and ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x ) in ( (1, 2) ).If ( Q(1) > 0 ) and ( Q(2) > 0 ), then we need to check if the minimum of ( Q(x) ) in ( (1, 2) ) is below zero.But perhaps a better approach is to consider the quadratic ( Q(x) = x^2 + (1 - a)x - 3 ) and find the values of ( a ) such that ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x in (1, 2) ).The quadratic ( Q(x) ) has its vertex at ( x = -b/(2a) ), where ( a = 1 ) (coefficient of ( x^2 )), so:[ x_v = -frac{1 - a}{2} = frac{a - 1}{2} ]The minimum value of ( Q(x) ) occurs at ( x = x_v ). If ( x_v in (1, 2) ), then the minimum is within the interval, and we can check if it's negative.Let's compute ( x_v ):[ x_v = frac{a - 1}{2} ]We need ( x_v in (1, 2) ):[ 1 < frac{a - 1}{2} < 2 ]Multiply all parts by 2:[ 2 < a - 1 < 4 ]Add 1:[ 3 < a < 5 ]So, if ( a in (3, 5) ), the vertex is within ( (1, 2) ). Let's compute the minimum value ( Q(x_v) ):[ Q(x_v) = x_v^2 + (1 - a)x_v - 3 ]Substitute ( x_v = frac{a - 1}{2} ):[ Qleft(frac{a - 1}{2}right) = left(frac{a - 1}{2}right)^2 + (1 - a)left(frac{a - 1}{2}right) - 3 ]Simplify:[ = frac{(a - 1)^2}{4} + frac{(1 - a)(a - 1)}{2} - 3 ]Note that ( (1 - a)(a - 1) = -(a - 1)^2 ), so:[ = frac{(a - 1)^2}{4} - frac{(a - 1)^2}{2} - 3 ]Combine terms:[ = frac{(a - 1)^2}{4} - frac{2(a - 1)^2}{4} - 3 ][ = -frac{(a - 1)^2}{4} - 3 ]This is always negative because ( -frac{(a - 1)^2}{4} ) is non-positive and subtracting 3 makes it negative. Therefore, if ( a in (3, 5) ), the quadratic has a minimum within ( (1, 2) ) which is negative, so ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x in (1, 2) ).Now, let's consider the cases where ( a leq 3 ) or ( a geq 5 ).If ( a leq 3 ), then ( x_v leq 1 ). So, the minimum of ( Q(x) ) is at ( x = 1 ). Compute ( Q(1) = -1 - a ). For ( a leq 3 ), ( Q(1) = -1 - a ). If ( a > -1 ), ( Q(1) < 0 ). So, for ( a > -1 ), ( Q(1) < 0 ), meaning ( Q(x) < 0 ) at ( x = 1 ), and since ( Q(x) ) is increasing for ( x > x_v ), there exists some ( x ) near 1 where ( Q(x) < 0 ).If ( a geq 5 ), then ( x_v geq 2 ). The minimum of ( Q(x) ) is at ( x = 2 ). Compute ( Q(2) = 3 - 2a ). For ( a geq 5 ), ( Q(2) = 3 - 2a leq 3 - 10 = -7 < 0 ). So, ( Q(2) < 0 ), and since ( Q(x) ) is increasing for ( x > x_v ), there exists some ( x ) near 2 where ( Q(x) < 0 ).Putting it all together:- For ( a > -1 ), ( Q(1) < 0 ), so there exists ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) < 0 ).- For ( a geq 3 ), even if ( a ) is larger, ( Q(x) ) is negative near ( x = 2 ).Wait, but actually, the condition ( a > -1 ) already covers all cases where ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x in (1, 2) ). Because if ( a > -1 ), then ( Q(1) < 0 ), and since ( Q(x) ) is continuous, there must be some ( x ) in ( (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) < 0 ).But let's double-check. Suppose ( a = 0 ), which is greater than -1. Then ( Q(x) = x^2 + x - 3 ). Let's compute ( Q(1) = 1 + 1 - 3 = -1 < 0 ), and ( Q(2) = 4 + 2 - 3 = 3 > 0 ). So, there is some ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) = 0 ), and thus ( Q(x) < 0 ) for some ( x ) in ( (1, 2) ).If ( a = -2 ), which is less than -1, then ( Q(x) = x^2 + (1 - (-2))x - 3 = x^2 + 3x - 3 ). Compute ( Q(1) = 1 + 3 - 3 = 1 > 0 ), and ( Q(2) = 4 + 6 - 3 = 7 > 0 ). So, ( Q(x) > 0 ) at both ends, and since the vertex is at ( x = (a - 1)/2 = (-2 - 1)/2 = -1.5 ), which is outside the interval ( (1, 2) ). Therefore, ( Q(x) ) is increasing on ( (1, 2) ), starting at ( Q(1) = 1 ) and increasing to ( Q(2) = 7 ). So, ( Q(x) > 0 ) for all ( x in (1, 2) ), meaning no solution exists for ( a = -2 ).Therefore, the critical point is ( a = -1 ). For ( a > -1 ), ( Q(1) < 0 ), ensuring that there's some ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) < 0 ). For ( a leq -1 ), ( Q(x) geq 0 ) for all ( x in (1, 2) ), so no solution exists.Thus, the range of ( a ) is ( a > -1 ), or in interval notation, ( (-1, infty) ).But wait, earlier I considered that for ( a geq 3 ), ( Q(2) < 0 ), but actually, ( Q(2) = 3 - 2a ). For ( a > 3/2 ), ( Q(2) < 0 ). So, if ( a > 3/2 ), ( Q(2) < 0 ), which means there exists ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) < 0 ).But combining with the previous condition, ( a > -1 ), the overall range is ( a > -1 ). Because even if ( a ) is between ( -1 ) and ( 3/2 ), ( Q(1) < 0 ), ensuring the existence of ( x in (1, 2) ) where ( Q(x) < 0 ).Therefore, the range of ( a ) is all real numbers greater than -1.**Final Answer**The range of real number ( a ) is boxed{[-1, +infty)}."},{"question":"Let ( P ) be a regular ( k )-gon inscribed in a circle of radius 1. Find the sum of the squares of the lengths of all the sides and diagonals of ( P ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the squares of the lengths of all the sides and diagonals of a regular k-gon inscribed in a circle of radius 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.First, I know that a regular k-gon has all its sides equal and all its internal angles equal. Since it's inscribed in a circle of radius 1, all the vertices lie on the circumference of this circle. I remember that the length of a side or a diagonal in a regular polygon can be found using the central angle subtended by those points.Let me recall the formula for the length of a chord in a circle. The length of a chord subtended by an angle Œ∏ at the center is given by 2r sin(Œ∏/2), where r is the radius of the circle. Since our radius is 1, the length simplifies to 2 sin(Œ∏/2). So, for a regular k-gon, the central angles between adjacent vertices are 2œÄ/k radians. Therefore, the length of a side (which is a chord subtended by an angle of 2œÄ/k) would be 2 sin(œÄ/k). Similarly, the length of a diagonal that skips one vertex would be subtended by an angle of 2*(2œÄ/k) = 4œÄ/k, so its length would be 2 sin(2œÄ/k), and so on.Wait, so for each vertex, the lengths of the sides and diagonals correspond to chords subtended by angles of 2œÄ/k, 4œÄ/k, 6œÄ/k, ..., up to 2œÄ(k-1)/k. But since the polygon is regular, these lengths repeat symmetrically. So, for each vertex, there are (k-1) chords (including the sides) connecting it to the other vertices.But I need the sum of the squares of all these lengths. So, for each vertex, I can compute the sum of the squares of the lengths of the chords connecting it to all other vertices, and then multiply by k (since there are k vertices). However, I have to be careful not to double-count the diagonals because each diagonal connects two vertices.Wait, no, actually, if I sum over all vertices, each diagonal is counted twice‚Äîonce from each end. So, maybe I should compute the sum for one vertex and then multiply by k, but then divide by 2 to account for double-counting. Hmm, this might get a bit messy. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I can use some properties of complex numbers or roots of unity to compute this sum. I remember that the vertices of a regular k-gon inscribed in the unit circle can be represented as the k-th roots of unity in the complex plane. So, the vertices are at points e^(2œÄi j/k) for j = 0, 1, 2, ..., k-1.If I consider two vertices, say at e^(2œÄi m/k) and e^(2œÄi n/k), the distance between them is |e^(2œÄi m/k) - e^(2œÄi n/k)|. The square of this distance is |e^(2œÄi m/k) - e^(2œÄi n/k)|¬≤. Expanding this, |e^(2œÄi m/k) - e^(2œÄi n/k)|¬≤ = (e^(2œÄi m/k) - e^(2œÄi n/k))(e^(-2œÄi m/k) - e^(-2œÄi n/k)) = 2 - e^(2œÄi (m - n)/k) - e^(-2œÄi (m - n)/k). Which simplifies to 2 - 2 cos(2œÄ(m - n)/k). So, the square of the distance is 2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k), where d is the difference between m and n modulo k.Therefore, the square of the length of a chord between two vertices separated by d steps is 2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k). Now, to find the sum of the squares of all sides and diagonals, I need to sum this expression over all possible pairs of vertices. But since the polygon is regular, the sum will depend only on the difference d between the vertices, so I can compute the sum for each possible d and then multiply by the number of such pairs.For a regular k-gon, the possible differences d are from 1 to floor(k/2). For each d, there are k pairs of vertices separated by d steps. So, the total sum S would be:S = k * Œ£ [from d=1 to floor(k/2)] (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)).But wait, actually, if k is even, when d = k/2, the chord is a diameter, and its length squared is (2)^2 = 4, which is 2 - 2 cos(œÄ) = 2 - (-2) = 4, so that works.But let me verify this approach. If I consider all pairs of vertices, each pair is separated by some d, where d ranges from 1 to k-1. However, due to symmetry, the sum for d and k-d is the same. So, instead of summing from d=1 to k-1, I can sum from d=1 to floor(k/2) and multiply appropriately.But actually, in the expression above, I considered that for each d, there are k pairs. But wait, that might not be correct. For each d from 1 to k-1, there are exactly k pairs of vertices separated by d steps. However, when d and k-d are different, they contribute the same value to the sum. So, if I sum over d=1 to k-1, each term is unique, but if I group them into pairs (d, k-d), each pair contributes twice the same value.But in my initial expression, I wrote S = k * Œ£ [from d=1 to floor(k/2)] (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)). Wait, that might not be accurate because for each d, there are k pairs, but if I sum over d=1 to floor(k/2), I might be missing some terms.Wait, no. Let me think again. For each d from 1 to k-1, the number of pairs separated by d steps is k. So, the total number of pairs is k*(k-1)/2, which is the number of unordered pairs of vertices. But when I sum over d=1 to k-1, I'm counting each pair once. So, the total sum S is Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)).But wait, no. Because for each d, the number of pairs is k, but actually, for each d, the number of pairs is k, but when d and k-d are different, they are separate terms. So, actually, the total sum is Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)).But let me compute this sum. Let's denote S = Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)).This simplifies to S = Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] 2 - 2 Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] cos(2œÄd/k).The first sum is straightforward: Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] 2 = 2(k-1).The second sum is 2 Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] cos(2œÄd/k). I recall that the sum of cos(2œÄd/k) from d=1 to k-1 is equal to -1. Because the sum of all k-th roots of unity is zero, so Œ£ [from d=0 to k-1] e^(2œÄi d/k) = 0, which implies Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] e^(2œÄi d/k) = -1. Taking the real part, we get Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] cos(2œÄd/k) = -1.Therefore, the second term becomes 2*(-1) = -2.So, putting it all together, S = 2(k-1) - (-2) = 2k - 2 + 2 = 2k.Wait, that can't be right because I'm summing over all pairs, but I thought each pair was counted once. But according to this, S = 2k.But wait, let's think about it. If k=3, a triangle, the sum of the squares of the sides would be 3*(2 - 2 cos(2œÄ/3)) = 3*(2 - 2*(-1/2)) = 3*(2 +1) = 9. But according to the formula above, S=2k=6, which is incorrect. So, something is wrong here.Wait, no, for k=3, the sum over d=1 to 2 of (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/3)). So, d=1: 2 - 2 cos(2œÄ/3) = 2 - 2*(-1/2) = 2 +1=3. d=2: 2 - 2 cos(4œÄ/3)= same as d=1, because cos(4œÄ/3)=cos(2œÄ/3)= -1/2. So, d=2 also gives 3. So, total sum S=3+3=6, which is 2k=6. But in reality, the triangle has 3 sides, each of length 2 sin(œÄ/3)=‚àö3, so the sum of squares is 3*(‚àö3)^2=9. So, my formula is giving 6 instead of 9. That's a problem.Wait, so where did I go wrong? Let me check.I think the issue is that when I considered the sum S = Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)), I was summing over all pairs of vertices, but in reality, each pair is counted once, but in the problem, we are considering all sides and diagonals, which includes each pair once. So, for k=3, the sum should be 3*(2 - 2 cos(2œÄ/3)) = 3*(3)=9, but according to the formula, it's 6. So, the formula is incorrect.Wait, no, actually, for k=3, the sum over d=1 to 2 is 3+3=6, but the actual sum of squares is 9. So, the formula is missing something.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me go back.I said that the square of the distance between two points e^(2œÄi m/k) and e^(2œÄi n/k) is |e^(2œÄi m/k) - e^(2œÄi n/k)|¬≤ = 2 - 2 cos(2œÄ(m-n)/k). So, for each pair (m,n), the square of the distance is 2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k), where d=|m-n|.But when I sum over all pairs, I have to consider that for each d from 1 to k-1, there are k pairs with that difference. So, the total sum S should be k * Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)).Wait, but that would be k times the sum, which for k=3 would be 3*(3+3)=18, which is even worse.Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.Actually, for each d from 1 to k-1, the number of pairs with that difference is k. So, the total sum S is Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] k*(2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)).But wait, that would be k times the sum from d=1 to k-1 of (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)).But earlier, I computed Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] (2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)) = 2k.So, if I multiply by k, I get S = k*(2k) = 2k¬≤, which for k=3 would be 18, which is way too high.But in reality, for k=3, the sum of squares is 9. So, clearly, my approach is flawed.Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me think about how many times each pair is counted.Each pair of vertices is connected by exactly one chord, so the total number of pairs is C(k,2) = k(k-1)/2. So, the sum S should be equal to Œ£ [all pairs] |e^(2œÄi m/k) - e^(2œÄi n/k)|¬≤.But when I express this as Œ£ [from d=1 to k-1] (number of pairs with difference d)*(2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)), the number of pairs with difference d is k for each d from 1 to k-1, but wait, that's not correct because for each d, the number of pairs is k only if we consider ordered pairs. But in reality, we are considering unordered pairs, so for d=1 to floor(k/2), the number of unordered pairs is k for each d, except when k is even and d=k/2, which would have k/2 pairs.Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify.In a regular k-gon, for each d from 1 to floor(k/2), the number of unordered pairs of vertices separated by d steps is k. Because for each vertex, there's exactly one vertex d steps away in each direction, but since we're considering unordered pairs, each pair is counted once. Wait, no, actually, for each d, the number of unordered pairs is k, because for each vertex, there's exactly one vertex d steps away in the clockwise direction, and since we're considering unordered pairs, each pair is counted once.Wait, no, that's not correct. For example, in a hexagon (k=6), for d=1, each vertex has two neighbors, but as unordered pairs, there are 6 edges. Similarly, for d=2, each vertex connects to the vertex two steps away, and there are 6 such diagonals. For d=3, each vertex connects to the opposite vertex, and there are 3 such diameters. So, in this case, for d=1 and d=2, the number of unordered pairs is 6, but for d=3, it's 3.So, in general, for a regular k-gon, the number of unordered pairs separated by d steps is k if d ‚â† k/2 (when k is even), and k/2 if d = k/2.Therefore, the total sum S can be expressed as:If k is odd:S = Œ£ [from d=1 to (k-1)/2] k*(2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)).If k is even:S = Œ£ [from d=1 to (k/2)-1] k*(2 - 2 cos(2œÄd/k)) + (k/2)*(2 - 2 cos(œÄ)).Because when k is even, the term for d=k/2 is different, as cos(œÄ) = -1, so 2 - 2 cos(œÄ) = 4.But let's see if we can find a general formula without splitting into cases.Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this sum using properties of complex numbers or vectors.I remember that the sum of all the vectors from the center to the vertices is zero because of symmetry. So, Œ£ [from j=0 to k-1] e^(2œÄi j/k) = 0.But how does that help with the sum of the squares of the distances between all pairs?Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances between all pairs can be related to the sum of the squares of the vectors.Let me denote the position vectors of the vertices as z_j = e^(2œÄi j/k) for j=0,1,...,k-1.Then, the square of the distance between z_m and z_n is |z_m - z_n|¬≤ = |z_m|¬≤ + |z_n|¬≤ - 2 Re(z_m overline{z_n}).Since |z_m| = |z_n| = 1, this simplifies to 1 + 1 - 2 Re(z_m overline{z_n}) = 2 - 2 Re(z_m overline{z_n}).So, the square of the distance is 2 - 2 Re(z_m overline{z_n}).Therefore, the sum S of the squares of all distances is Œ£ [m < n] |z_m - z_n|¬≤ = Œ£ [m < n] (2 - 2 Re(z_m overline{z_n})).This can be rewritten as:S = Œ£ [m < n] 2 - 2 Œ£ [m < n] Re(z_m overline{z_n}).The first sum is 2 times the number of pairs, which is 2 * C(k,2) = 2*(k(k-1)/2) = k(k-1).The second sum is 2 times the real part of Œ£ [m < n] z_m overline{z_n}.But Œ£ [m < n] z_m overline{z_n} is equal to (1/2) [ (Œ£ z_j)(Œ£ overline{z_j}) - Œ£ |z_j|¬≤ ].Because Œ£ [m < n] z_m overline{z_n} = (1/2) [ (Œ£ z_j)(Œ£ overline{z_j}) - Œ£ |z_j|¬≤ ].Since Œ£ z_j = 0 (as the sum of the k-th roots of unity is zero), and Œ£ |z_j|¬≤ = k (since each |z_j|¬≤ = 1), we have:Œ£ [m < n] z_m overline{z_n} = (1/2) [0 - k] = -k/2.Therefore, the second sum is 2 * Re(-k/2) = 2*(-k/2) = -k.Putting it all together, S = k(k-1) - (-k) = k(k-1) + k = k¬≤ - k + k = k¬≤.Wait, that's interesting. So, the sum of the squares of all the sides and diagonals of a regular k-gon inscribed in a unit circle is k¬≤.But let me verify this with the triangle example. For k=3, the sum should be 9. According to this formula, S=3¬≤=9, which matches. For k=4, a square, the sum of the squares of the sides and diagonals: each side squared is (2 sin(œÄ/4))¬≤ = (sqrt(2))¬≤=2, and there are 4 sides, so 4*2=8. The diagonals are the two diameters, each squared is (2)^2=4, so total diagonals sum is 2*4=8. So, total sum is 8+8=16, which is 4¬≤=16. That works too.Another test: k=5. The sum should be 25. Let's see: each side squared is (2 sin(œÄ/5))¬≤ ‚âà (1.17557)^2‚âà1.38197, but actually, more accurately, 4 sin¬≤(œÄ/5). Similarly, the diagonals have different lengths. But instead of computing each, let's rely on the formula. The sum should be 25, which seems plausible.So, it seems that the sum of the squares of all the sides and diagonals of a regular k-gon inscribed in a unit circle is indeed k¬≤.Therefore, the final answer is k squared, which is boxed{k^2}."},{"question":"Determine all positive real numbers  a  such that there exists a positive integer  n  and partition  A_1 ,  A_2 , ...,  A_n  of infinity sets of the set of the integers satisfying the following condition: for every set  A_i , the positive difference of any pair of elements in  A_i  is at least  a^i .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine all positive real numbers ( a ) such that there exists a positive integer ( n ) and a partition ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) of the set of integers. Each set ( A_i ) must satisfy the condition that the positive difference between any pair of elements in ( A_i ) is at least ( a^i ).Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, I need to understand what it means to partition the integers into sets ( A_1 ) through ( A_n ). Each integer must belong to exactly one of these sets, and each set ( A_i ) must be infinite because the problem mentions \\"infinity sets.\\" So, each ( A_i ) is an infinite subset of integers.Now, the key condition is that within each ( A_i ), any two elements must be at least ( a^i ) apart. That means if I pick any two numbers from ( A_i ), say ( x ) and ( y ), then ( |x - y| geq a^i ). This reminds me of something like arithmetic progressions, where you have numbers spaced at regular intervals. But here, the spacing requirement depends on the set ( A_i ) and the parameter ( a ).I think I should consider how these sets ( A_i ) can be constructed. Maybe I can model each ( A_i ) as an arithmetic progression with a common difference of at least ( a^i ). But wait, ( a ) is a real number, not necessarily an integer. So, the spacing ( a^i ) might not be an integer. That complicates things because the differences between integers must be integers.Hmm, so perhaps ( a^i ) needs to be an integer? Or maybe the differences just need to be at least ( a^i ), which could be a non-integer. But since we're dealing with integers, the actual difference will be the ceiling of ( a^i ) or something like that. Maybe I can just consider ( a^i ) as a lower bound for the spacing between consecutive elements in ( A_i ).Let me think about the density of these sets. If each ( A_i ) has elements spaced at least ( a^i ) apart, then the density of ( A_i ) in the integers is at most ( 1/a^i ). Because if you have numbers spaced ( d ) apart, the density is roughly ( 1/d ). So, the density of each ( A_i ) is bounded by ( 1/a^i ).Since the entire set of integers is partitioned into these ( A_i ) sets, the sum of their densities should be at least 1. That is, ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{a^i} geq 1 ). But wait, actually, since each ( A_i ) is infinite, their densities can't be zero, but the sum of their densities must cover the entire integer set, which has density 1.But I need to be careful here. The upper density of each ( A_i ) is at most ( 1/a^i ), so the sum of the upper densities is ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{a^i} ). Since the upper density of the union is at most the sum of the upper densities, we have ( 1 leq sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{a^i} ).Wait, but this is a finite sum because ( n ) is finite. So, ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{a^i} ) must be at least 1. But if ( a ) is too large, this sum might be less than 1, which would be a problem. On the other hand, if ( a ) is small, the sum could be larger than 1, which is acceptable.Let me consider the case where ( a = 2 ). Then, ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{2^i} = 1 - frac{1}{2^n} ). So, as ( n ) increases, this sum approaches 1. But for any finite ( n ), it's less than 1. Therefore, if ( a = 2 ), we can't cover the entire integer set with a finite partition because the sum of densities would be less than 1.What if ( a < 2 )? Let's say ( a = 1.5 ). Then, ( sum_{i=1}^infty frac{1}{(1.5)^i} ) converges to ( frac{1/1.5}{1 - 1/1.5} = frac{2/3}{1/3} = 2 ). So, if we take a finite ( n ), the sum ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{(1.5)^i} ) will be less than 2. But we need the sum to be at least 1. So, for ( a < 2 ), the infinite sum is greater than 1, which means that for some finite ( n ), the sum ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{a^i} ) will exceed 1.Therefore, it seems that for ( a < 2 ), it's possible to find a finite ( n ) such that the sum of the densities ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{a^i} geq 1 ), which is necessary for covering the entire set of integers.But I need to make sure that such a partition actually exists. Maybe I can construct it explicitly. Let's think about how to partition the integers into sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) where each ( A_i ) has elements spaced at least ( a^i ) apart.One approach is to use modular arithmetic. For example, if I take ( A_1 ) as numbers congruent to 0 mod ( k_1 ), ( A_2 ) as numbers congruent to 1 mod ( k_2 ), and so on, ensuring that the differences are large enough. But I need to make sure that the spacings ( k_i ) are at least ( a^i ).Alternatively, I can think of each ( A_i ) as containing numbers in specific intervals. For instance, ( A_1 ) could contain numbers spaced ( lceil a rceil ) apart, ( A_2 ) spaced ( lceil a^2 rceil ) apart, and so on. But I need to ensure that every integer is covered exactly once.Wait, maybe I can use a greedy algorithm. Start with the smallest integer, assign it to ( A_1 ), then skip the next ( lfloor a rfloor ) integers, assign the next one to ( A_1 ), and so on. Then do the same for ( A_2 ), but with spacing ( a^2 ), and so on. But I need to make sure that this process covers all integers without overlap.This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's consider the case where ( a ) is an integer. If ( a = 2 ), then each ( A_i ) must have elements spaced at least ( 2^i ) apart. But as we saw earlier, the sum of densities would be less than 1 for any finite ( n ), so it's not possible.But if ( a < 2 ), say ( a = 1.5 ), then the required spacing grows exponentially, but the sum of densities can exceed 1 for some finite ( n ). So, it's possible to cover all integers with such a partition.Wait, but how exactly? Maybe I can use a base-( a ) representation or something like that. If ( a ) is a real number less than 2, perhaps I can represent each integer in a way that allows me to assign it to one of the ( A_i ) sets with the required spacing.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of binary representations. Since ( a < 2 ), the spacings ( a^i ) grow slower than powers of 2. Maybe I can partition the integers based on their binary digits or something similar.But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach. Let's consider the upper density argument again. If ( a < 2 ), then the sum ( sum_{i=1}^infty frac{1}{a^i} ) converges to ( frac{1}{a - 1} ). So, for ( a < 2 ), this sum is greater than 1, which means that for some finite ( n ), the partial sum ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{a^i} geq 1 ). Therefore, it's possible to have such a partition because the total density required is at least 1.But I need to ensure that the sets ( A_i ) can actually be constructed. Maybe I can use a recursive approach. Start with ( A_1 ), assign numbers spaced ( lceil a rceil ) apart, then assign the remaining numbers to ( A_2 ) with spacing ( lceil a^2 rceil ), and so on. But I need to make sure that this process doesn't leave any numbers unassigned.Alternatively, think about each ( A_i ) as containing numbers in specific residue classes modulo some base. For example, if I choose a base ( b ), then each residue class modulo ( b ) can be assigned to a different ( A_i ), ensuring that the spacing is at least ( b ). But I need the spacing to be at least ( a^i ), so I need to choose ( b ) such that ( b geq a^i ) for each ( i ).Wait, but ( b ) is fixed, while ( a^i ) increases with ( i ). So, this might not work because for larger ( i ), ( a^i ) could exceed ( b ), making the spacing insufficient.Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let's consider the problem from another angle. Suppose I fix ( n ) and try to find the maximum ( a ) such that the partition is possible. Then, as ( n ) increases, the maximum ( a ) approaches 2.But I need to find all ( a ) such that there exists some ( n ). So, for any ( a < 2 ), there exists an ( n ) such that the partition is possible.Wait, let's think about the case where ( a = 1 ). Then, each ( A_i ) must have elements spaced at least 1 apart, which is trivial because all integers are spaced at least 1 apart. So, any partition into ( n ) infinite sets would work. For example, ( A_1 ) could be all even numbers, ( A_2 ) all numbers congruent to 1 mod 3, and so on.But as ( a ) increases towards 2, the required spacing increases, making it harder to cover all integers with a finite partition.So, putting it all together, it seems that the critical value is ( a = 2 ). For ( a < 2 ), it's possible to find a finite ( n ) such that the partition exists, while for ( a geq 2 ), it's not possible.Therefore, the answer should be all positive real numbers ( a ) such that ( a < 2 )."},{"question":"For how many primes  p ,  |p^4-86|  is also prime? textbf{(A)} 0 qquadtextbf{(B)} 1 qquadtextbf{(C)} 2 qquadtextbf{(D)} 3 qquadtextbf{(E)} 4 ","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: For how many primes ( p ), ( |p^4 - 86| ) is also prime? The options are from A to E, with E being 4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First off, I need to consider prime numbers ( p ) such that when I compute ( p^4 ) and subtract 86, the absolute value of that result is also a prime number. So, essentially, I'm looking for primes ( p ) where ( |p^4 - 86| ) is prime.Let me start by listing some small prime numbers because primes are the building blocks, and often these kinds of problems don't require very large primes. The small primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. Maybe I can test these and see if any of them satisfy the condition.Starting with ( p = 2 ):( 2^4 = 16 )So, ( |16 - 86| = | -70 | = 70 )70 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 2, 5, 7, etc. So, 2 doesn't work.Next, ( p = 3 ):( 3^4 = 81 )( |81 - 86| = | -5 | = 5 )5 is a prime number. Okay, so 3 works. That's one prime so far.Moving on to ( p = 5 ):( 5^4 = 625 )( |625 - 86| = |539| = 539 )Is 539 a prime? Hmm, let me check. 539 divided by 7 is 77, because 7 times 77 is 539. Wait, 77 is 7 times 11, so 539 is 7 squared times 11. That means 539 is not a prime. So, 5 doesn't work.Next prime is 7:( 7^4 = 2401 )( |2401 - 86| = |2315| = 2315 )Is 2315 prime? Let me see. It ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. 2315 divided by 5 is 463. Is 463 prime? Hmm, 463 divided by 2 is not whole, divided by 3 is not, 5? No, 7? 7 times 66 is 462, so 463 is prime. Wait, but 2315 is 5 times 463, so it's not prime. So, 7 doesn't work.Next, ( p = 11 ):( 11^4 = 14641 )( |14641 - 86| = |14555| = 14555 )14555 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. 14555 divided by 5 is 2911. Is 2911 prime? Let me check. 2911 divided by 13 is 223.923... Not a whole number. Divided by 7? 2911 divided by 7 is approximately 415.857... Not whole. Maybe 11? 2911 divided by 11 is 264.636... Not whole. Hmm, maybe it's prime? Wait, actually, 2911 is 29 times 100.379... No, 29 times 100 is 2900, so 29 times 100.379 is 2911? Wait, 29 times 100 is 2900, plus 29 times 0.379 is about 11, so total is 2911. So, 29 times 100.379 is 2911, but 100.379 isn't an integer. So, maybe 2911 is prime? Wait, actually, 2911 divided by 13 is 223.923, which isn't whole. Divided by 17? 2911 divided by 17 is 171.235... Not whole. 19? 2911 divided by 19 is 153.21... Not whole. 23? 2911 divided by 23 is 126.565... Not whole. 29? 2911 divided by 29 is 100.379... Not whole. So, maybe 2911 is prime? Wait, but 2911 is 2911. Let me check with another method. Maybe it's a prime. But regardless, 14555 is 5 times 2911, so it's not prime. So, 11 doesn't work.Wait, this is getting tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this instead of just plugging in primes one by one.Let me think about the expression ( |p^4 - 86| ). For this to be prime, it must be that ( p^4 - 86 ) is either a prime or its negative is a prime, but since we're taking absolute value, it's the same as saying ( |p^4 - 86| ) is prime.So, ( |p^4 - 86| ) must be a prime number. Let's denote ( q = |p^4 - 86| ), so ( q ) is prime.Now, ( p ) is a prime, so ( p ) is at least 2. Let's see what ( p^4 ) looks like for small primes:- ( p = 2 ): 16- ( p = 3 ): 81- ( p = 5 ): 625- ( p = 7 ): 2401- ( p = 11 ): 14641So, as ( p ) increases, ( p^4 ) grows rapidly. Therefore, ( |p^4 - 86| ) will be a large number for larger primes, which might not be prime. So, maybe only small primes need to be considered.We've already checked up to ( p = 11 ), and only ( p = 3 ) worked. Let's check ( p = 13 ):( 13^4 = 28561 )( |28561 - 86| = |28475| = 28475 )28475 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. Therefore, not prime.Next, ( p = 17 ):( 17^4 = 83521 )( |83521 - 86| = |83435| = 83435 )Again, ends with a 5, divisible by 5, not prime.Okay, so it seems like for primes larger than 3, ( p^4 ) is way larger than 86, so ( p^4 - 86 ) is a large number. But is there a way to know if it's prime without checking each one?Wait, maybe I can think about modulo operations. For example, if ( p ) is a prime not equal to 5, then by Fermat's Little Theorem, ( p^4 equiv 1 mod 5 ). So, ( p^4 - 86 equiv 1 - 86 mod 5 ). Let's compute that:( 86 mod 5 ) is 1, because 5*17=85, so 86-85=1. Therefore, ( p^4 - 86 equiv 1 - 1 = 0 mod 5 ). So, ( p^4 - 86 ) is divisible by 5. Therefore, ( |p^4 - 86| ) is either 5 or a multiple of 5. But since ( |p^4 - 86| ) is supposed to be prime, the only possibility is that ( |p^4 - 86| = 5 ).So, ( |p^4 - 86| = 5 ). This gives two equations:1. ( p^4 - 86 = 5 ) => ( p^4 = 91 )2. ( p^4 - 86 = -5 ) => ( p^4 = 81 )Let's solve these:1. ( p^4 = 91 ). Is 91 a perfect fourth power? Well, 3^4 is 81, 4^4 is 256. So, 91 is between 81 and 256, but it's not a perfect fourth power. Therefore, no solution here.2. ( p^4 = 81 ). What's the fourth root of 81? Well, 3^4 is 81, so ( p = 3 ). That's a prime.Therefore, the only prime ( p ) that satisfies ( |p^4 - 86| ) being prime is ( p = 3 ).Wait, but earlier I checked ( p = 5 ) and got 539, which is not prime. But according to this modulo argument, for any prime ( p ) not equal to 5, ( |p^4 - 86| ) is divisible by 5, hence can only be prime if it's equal to 5. So, only ( p = 3 ) works.But let me double-check ( p = 5 ). ( 5^4 = 625 ). ( 625 - 86 = 539 ). 539 divided by 7 is 77, which is 7*11. So, 539 is 7*77, which is 7*7*11. So, it's not prime. So, even though ( p = 5 ) is a prime, ( |5^4 - 86| ) is not prime.Therefore, the only prime ( p ) that works is 3. So, the answer is 1.But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other primes. I checked up to ( p = 17 ), but maybe there's a prime between 3 and 5? No, 5 is the next prime after 3. So, no primes in between. So, I think I've covered all possibilities.So, conclusion: Only ( p = 3 ) satisfies the condition, so the number of such primes is 1."},{"question":"Let similar sizes be those that differ by less than 2 times. Prove that a heap of 660 stones cannot be divided into 31 smaller heaps.Let I be the center of the inscribed circle omega of triangle ABC. The circumcircle of triangle AIC intersects omega at points P and Q (such that P and A are on one side of line BI, and Q and C are on the other side).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to prove that a heap of 660 stones cannot be divided into 31 smaller heaps, where similar sizes are defined as those that differ by less than 2 times. Hmm, that means if I have a heap of size m, all other heaps must be either less than 2m or more than m/2. Wait, actually, it says differ by less than 2 times, so I think that means if one heap is m, another heap can't be more than 2m or less than m/2. So, all heaps must be within a factor of 2 of each other. Let me try to understand the problem better. If I have 660 stones and I want to split them into 31 heaps, each heap must be such that no two heaps differ by more than a factor of 2. So, if the smallest heap has k stones, the largest heap can have at most 2k stones. That seems like a constraint on the range of heap sizes.I remember something about the pigeonhole principle, which might be useful here. If I have a certain number of objects and I try to distribute them into containers with certain constraints, sometimes it's impossible. Maybe I can apply that here.Let me think about the minimum and maximum possible sizes of the heaps. If all heaps are as small as possible, the smallest heap would be 1 stone, but then the largest heap could be up to 2 stones. But wait, if I have 31 heaps, and each heap is either 1 or 2 stones, the total number of stones would be between 31 and 62, which is way less than 660. So that's not helpful.Alternatively, if I consider the heaps to be as large as possible, but still within a factor of 2 of each other. Let's say the smallest heap is m, then the largest heap is less than 2m. So, all heaps are between m and 2m. The total number of stones would then be between 31m and 62m. Since the total is 660, we have 31m ‚â§ 660 ‚â§ 62m. Let me solve for m.First, 31m ‚â§ 660 ‚áí m ‚â§ 660 / 31 ‚âà 21.29. So m is at most 21.Second, 660 ‚â§ 62m ‚áí m ‚â• 660 / 62 ‚âà 10.645. So m is at least 11.So m is between 11 and 21. That gives me a range for the smallest heap. Now, if all heaps are between 11 and 21, can I have 31 heaps summing to 660?Wait, but 31 heaps each with at least 11 stones would sum to 341 stones, which is way less than 660. So that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to think differently.Perhaps I need to consider that the heaps can't all be too small or too large. If I have 31 heaps, each heap must be at least m and at most 2m. So the total number of stones is between 31m and 62m. Since 660 is between 31m and 62m, m must be between approximately 10.645 and 21.29, as I found earlier.But how does that help me? Maybe I need to consider the average size of the heaps. The average would be 660 / 31 ‚âà 21.29. So, on average, each heap is about 21 stones. But since all heaps must be within a factor of 2 of each other, the smallest heap must be at least 11 (since 21 / 2 ‚âà 10.5, so 11). Wait, so if the average is about 21, and the smallest heap is 11, then the largest heap can be up to 42 (since 21 * 2 = 42). But 42 is way larger than the average. Let me check: if I have some heaps at 11 and some at 42, can I get a total of 660?Let me set up an equation. Let x be the number of heaps with 11 stones, and y be the number of heaps with 42 stones. Then, x + y = 31, and 11x + 42y = 660.Solving these equations: From the first equation, x = 31 - y. Substitute into the second equation: 11(31 - y) + 42y = 660 ‚áí 341 - 11y + 42y = 660 ‚áí 31y = 319 ‚áí y = 10.29. Hmm, that's not an integer, so that doesn't work.Maybe I need to consider heaps of different sizes between 11 and 42. But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.I recall that in problems like this, sometimes you can use the concept of geometric sequences or something related to binary representations because of the factor of 2. Let me think about that.If I have heaps that are all within a factor of 2, then the sizes must lie in an interval where the maximum is less than twice the minimum. So, if I start with the smallest heap m, the next possible heap is m+1, but it has to be less than 2m. Wait, no, it's not necessarily consecutive integers. It could be any sizes as long as they are within a factor of 2.But maybe I can model this as a range. If the smallest heap is m, then all heaps are in [m, 2m). So, the number of distinct heap sizes is limited by the range. But I'm not sure how that helps.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of the minimum number of heaps needed to cover the total. If I have 31 heaps, each at least m, then the total is at least 31m. But 31m ‚â§ 660, so m ‚â§ 21.29. But I also have that the largest heap is less than 2m, so the total is less than 31*2m = 62m. So, 660 < 62m ‚áí m > 10.645. So m is between 11 and 21.But how does that help me? Maybe I need to consider that if I have 31 heaps, each at least 11, then the total is at least 341, which is much less than 660. So, to reach 660, some heaps must be much larger. But if the largest heap is less than 2m, and m is at least 11, then the largest heap is less than 22. Wait, that can't be, because 31 heaps of 22 would be 682, which is more than 660. Hmm, maybe m is 11, and the largest heap is 21, since 21 is less than 2*11=22.Wait, but 21 is less than 22, so that's okay. So, if m=11, the largest heap can be up to 21. Then, the total number of stones would be between 31*11=341 and 31*21=651. But 651 is less than 660, so that's a problem. Because 660 is more than 651, which is the maximum total if all heaps are 21. So, that's a contradiction.Wait, so if m=11, the maximum total is 651, which is less than 660. Therefore, it's impossible to have 31 heaps with sizes between 11 and 21 summing to 660. Therefore, it's impossible to divide 660 stones into 31 heaps where all heaps are within a factor of 2 of each other.Is that the argument? Let me check again.If the smallest heap is m, then the largest heap is less than 2m. So, the total number of stones is less than 31*2m. We have 660 < 62m ‚áí m > 10.645. So m must be at least 11.But if m=11, then the largest heap is less than 22, so at most 21. Then, the total number of stones is at most 31*21=651, which is less than 660. Therefore, it's impossible.Yes, that seems to be the argument. So, the key idea is that if you have 31 heaps, each at least m, then the total is at least 31m. But if all heaps are less than 2m, the total is less than 62m. So, 31m ‚â§ 660 < 62m. Solving for m, we get m > 10.645 and m ‚â§ 21.29. But if m=11, the maximum total is 651, which is less than 660. Therefore, it's impossible.I think that's the proof. It's a bit straightforward, but I think it works. Maybe I should write it more formally."},{"question":"salad dressing p is made up of 30 % vinegar and 70 % oil , and salad dressing q contains 10 % vinegar and 90 % oil . if the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12 % vinegar , dressing p comprises what percentage of the new dressing ?","answer":"First, I'll assume a total of 100 grams for the new salad dressing to simplify the calculations.Let ( x ) represent the amount of Dressing P in grams, and ( 100 - x ) represent the amount of Dressing Q in grams.Dressing P contains 30% vinegar, so the amount of vinegar from Dressing P is ( 0.30x ) grams.Dressing Q contains 10% vinegar, so the amount of vinegar from Dressing Q is ( 0.10(100 - x) ) grams.The new dressing has a total of 12% vinegar, which is ( 12 ) grams.Setting up the equation based on the total vinegar:[0.30x + 0.10(100 - x) = 12]Expanding and simplifying the equation:[0.30x + 10 - 0.10x = 12][0.20x + 10 = 12][0.20x = 2][x = frac{2}{0.20} = 10]Thus, Dressing P comprises 10 grams of the new dressing.

Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I know that a bijection from a set to itself is essentially a permutation. So, ( f ) is a permutation of the set ( A_n ), which has ( n ) elements. The condition ( f^{(m)} = f ) means that if I apply the permutation ( f ) ( m ) times, I get back to the original permutation ( f ). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think about it again.Actually, ( f^{(m)} ) usually denotes the ( m )-th iterate of ( f ), meaning applying ( f ) ( m ) times. So, ( f^{(m)} = f ) implies that applying ( f ) ( m ) times is the same as applying ( f ) once. That suggests that ( f^{(m-1)} ) is the identity permutation because if I apply ( f ) ( m ) times and get ( f ), then applying ( f ) ( m-1 ) times should give me the identity. So, ( f^{(m-1)} = text{id} ).But wait, is that necessarily true? Let me check. If ( f^{(m)} = f ), then ( f^{(m)} circ f^{-1} = f circ f^{-1} ), which simplifies to ( f^{(m-1)} = text{id} ). Yes, that seems correct. So, ( f ) must be a permutation whose order divides ( m-1 ). That is, the order of ( f ) is a divisor of ( m-1 ).Now, permutations can be decomposed into cycles. The order of a permutation is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its cycles. So, if the order of ( f ) divides ( m-1 ), then the LCM of the cycle lengths of ( f ) must divide ( m-1 ). Therefore, each cycle length must divide ( m-1 ).So, to count the number of such permutations, I need to count all permutations of ( A_n ) where each cycle length divides ( m-1 ). This sounds like a problem that can be approached using exponential generating functions or inclusion-exclusion principles.Let me recall that the exponential generating function for permutations with cycle lengths in a set ( S ) is given by ( expleft(sum_{k in S} frac{x^k}{k}right) ). In our case, ( S ) is the set of divisors of ( m-1 ).So, if I let ( D = { d mid d text{ divides } m-1 } ), then the exponential generating function for the number of such permutations is ( expleft(sum_{d in D} frac{x^d}{d}right) ).To find the number of permutations of ( A_n ) with all cycle lengths dividing ( m-1 ), I need the coefficient of ( x^n ) in this generating function multiplied by ( n! ). That is, the number of such permutations is ( n! times [x^n] expleft(sum_{d in D} frac{x^d}{d}right) ).But calculating this directly might be complicated. Maybe there's a better way. I remember that the number of permutations of ( n ) elements with cycle lengths dividing ( m-1 ) can be expressed using the M√∂bius function or inclusion-exclusion.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of necklace counting or something related to group actions, but I'm not sure.Wait, another approach: the number of such permutations is equal to the sum over all partitions of ( n ) into cycle lengths that divide ( m-1 ), and for each such partition, the number of permutations is ( frac{n!}{prod_{i} k_i^{x_i} x_i!} ), where ( k_i ) are the cycle lengths and ( x_i ) are their multiplicities.So, if I denote ( D = { d mid d text{ divides } m-1 } ), then the number of permutations is:[sum_{substack{x_d geq 0  sum_{d in D} d x_d = n}} frac{n!}{prod_{d in D} d^{x_d} x_d!}]This seems like the correct formula. Each term in the sum corresponds to a specific way of partitioning ( n ) into cycles of lengths dividing ( m-1 ), and the coefficient counts the number of such permutations.Let me test this with a small example to see if it makes sense. Suppose ( n = 3 ) and ( m = 4 ). Then ( m-1 = 3 ), so the divisors are 1 and 3. So, permutations can have cycles of length 1 or 3.The number of such permutations would be:- All fixed points (cycle length 1): There's only 1 such permutation, the identity.- One 3-cycle: There are ( frac{3!}{3} = 2 ) such permutations.So, total permutations: 1 + 2 = 3.Using the formula:[sum_{substack{x_1, x_3 geq 0  x_1 + 3x_3 = 3}} frac{3!}{1^{x_1} x_1! 3^{x_3} x_3!}]Possible partitions:1. ( x_1 = 3, x_3 = 0 ): ( frac{6}{1^3 3!} = frac{6}{6} = 1 )2. ( x_1 = 0, x_3 = 1 ): ( frac{6}{3^1 1!} = frac{6}{3} = 2 )Total: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches our manual count. Good, the formula seems to work.Another test case: ( n = 4 ), ( m = 5 ). Then ( m-1 = 4 ), divisors are 1, 2, 4.Possible cycle types:- All fixed points: 1 permutation.- One 2-cycle and two fixed points: ( frac{4!}{2^1 1! 1^2 2!} = frac{24}{2 times 2} = 6 )- Two 2-cycles: ( frac{4!}{2^2 2!} = frac{24}{4 times 2} = 3 )- One 4-cycle: ( frac{4!}{4^1 1!} = frac{24}{4} = 6 )Total permutations: 1 + 6 + 3 + 6 = 16.Using the formula:[sum_{substack{x_1, x_2, x_4 geq 0  x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_4 = 4}} frac{4!}{1^{x_1} x_1! 2^{x_2} x_2! 4^{x_4} x_4!}]Possible partitions:1. ( x_1 = 4, x_2 = 0, x_4 = 0 ): ( frac{24}{1^4 4!} = frac{24}{24} = 1 )2. ( x_1 = 2, x_2 = 1, x_4 = 0 ): ( frac{24}{1^2 2! 2^1 1!} = frac{24}{2 times 2} = 6 )3. ( x_1 = 0, x_2 = 2, x_4 = 0 ): ( frac{24}{2^2 2!} = frac{24}{4 times 2} = 3 )4. ( x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0, x_4 = 1 ): ( frac{24}{4^1 1!} = frac{24}{4} = 6 )Total: 1 + 6 + 3 + 6 = 16, which matches. Great, the formula works here too.So, generalizing, the number of bijections ( f: A_n rightarrow A_n ) satisfying ( f^{(m)} = f ) is equal to the number of permutations of ( A_n ) with all cycle lengths dividing ( m-1 ). This can be calculated using the formula:[sum_{substack{x_d geq 0  sum_{d mid (m-1)} d x_d = n}} frac{n!}{prod_{d mid (m-1)} d^{x_d} x_d!}]This sum is over all possible ways to partition ( n ) into cycles whose lengths are divisors of ( m-1 ), and for each partition, we count the number of permutations with that cycle structure.I think this is the correct approach. It aligns with the examples I tested and the theory of permutation cycles. So, the final answer should be expressed in terms of this sum, which counts the number of such permutations.**Final Answer**The number of such bijections ( f ) is given by the sum over all cycle type partitions of ( n ) where each cycle length divides ( m-1 ). The formula is:[boxed{sum_{substack{x_d geq 0  sum_{d mid (m-1)} d x_d = n}} frac{n!}{prod_{d mid (m-1)} d^{x_d} x_d!}}]"},{"question":"Given f(x)=2xln x, g(x)=-x^{2}+ax-3. Find:(‚Ö†) The minimum value of the function f(x).(‚Ö°) If there exists xin (0,+infty) such that f(x)leqslant g(x) holds, find the range of real number a.(‚Ö¢) Prove that for all xin (0,+infty), f(x)>2(frac{x}{e^x}-frac{2}{e}) holds.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem with three parts, all involving these two functions f(x) and g(x). Let me take it step by step.First, part (I) asks for the minimum value of f(x) = 2x ln x. Okay, I remember that to find the minimum or maximum of a function, I need to take its derivative and set it equal to zero. So, let me compute f'(x).f'(x) = derivative of 2x ln x. Using the product rule: derivative of 2x is 2, times ln x, plus 2x times derivative of ln x, which is 1/x. So, f'(x) = 2 ln x + 2*(1/x)*x? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the derivative of 2x is 2, so f'(x) = 2 ln x + 2*(1/x)*x? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.Wait, f(x) = 2x ln x. So, f'(x) is derivative of 2x times ln x. So, using the product rule: derivative of 2x is 2, times ln x, plus 2x times derivative of ln x, which is 1/x. So, f'(x) = 2 ln x + 2*(1/x)*x? Wait, that would be 2 ln x + 2*(1/x)*x. Wait, 2*(1/x)*x is just 2. So, f'(x) = 2 ln x + 2.Okay, so f'(x) = 2 ln x + 2. To find critical points, set f'(x) = 0.So, 2 ln x + 2 = 0. Divide both sides by 2: ln x + 1 = 0. So, ln x = -1. Therefore, x = e^{-1} = 1/e.So, the critical point is at x = 1/e. Now, is this a minimum or maximum? Let me check the second derivative or analyze the sign of f'(x) around x = 1/e.Alternatively, I can test values around x = 1/e. Let's pick x slightly less than 1/e, say x = 1/(e^2). Then ln x = -2, so f'(x) = 2*(-2) + 2 = -4 + 2 = -2, which is negative. So, f(x) is decreasing before x = 1/e.Now, pick x slightly more than 1/e, say x = 1. Then ln x = 0, so f'(x) = 0 + 2 = 2, which is positive. So, f(x) is increasing after x = 1/e. Therefore, x = 1/e is a minimum.So, the minimum value is f(1/e) = 2*(1/e)*ln(1/e). ln(1/e) is -1, so f(1/e) = 2*(1/e)*(-1) = -2/e.Okay, so part (I) is done, and the minimum value is -2/e.Moving on to part (II): If there exists x in (0, +infty) such that f(x) <= g(x), find the range of real number a.Given f(x) = 2x ln x and g(x) = -x^2 + a x - 3. So, we need to find a such that 2x ln x <= -x^2 + a x - 3 for some x > 0.Let me rearrange the inequality: 2x ln x + x^2 - a x + 3 <= 0.So, 2x ln x + x^2 - a x + 3 <= 0. Let me define h(x) = 2x ln x + x^2 - a x + 3. We need h(x) <= 0 for some x > 0.But since we need to find a such that there exists x with h(x) <= 0, we can think about the minimum of h(x). If the minimum of h(x) is <= 0, then such x exists.So, let's find the minimum of h(x). To find the critical points, take derivative h'(x).h(x) = 2x ln x + x^2 - a x + 3.h'(x) = derivative of 2x ln x is 2 ln x + 2, plus derivative of x^2 is 2x, minus derivative of a x is a, plus derivative of 3 is 0.So, h'(x) = 2 ln x + 2 + 2x - a.Set h'(x) = 0: 2 ln x + 2 + 2x - a = 0. So, a = 2 ln x + 2 + 2x.So, to find the critical points, a is expressed in terms of x. But we need to find the range of a such that h(x) <= 0 for some x.Alternatively, perhaps we can think of h(x) as a function of x, and find its minimum, then set the minimum <= 0.But h(x) is a function of x, and a is a parameter. So, perhaps we can think of h(x) = x^2 + 2x ln x - a x + 3.To find the minimum of h(x), we can set h'(x) = 0, which gives a = 2 ln x + 2 + 2x.So, for each x, a is determined as above. Then, the minimum of h(x) occurs at x where a = 2 ln x + 2 + 2x.But since a is a parameter, perhaps we need to find the minimum value of h(x) in terms of a, and set it <= 0.Alternatively, maybe it's better to express a in terms of x and find the range of a such that h(x) <= 0 for some x.Wait, let's think differently. The inequality is 2x ln x <= -x^2 + a x - 3.Rearranged, it's 2x ln x + x^2 - a x + 3 <= 0.Let me define h(x) = 2x ln x + x^2 - a x + 3. We need h(x) <= 0 for some x > 0.To find the range of a such that h(x) <= 0 for some x, we can find the minimum of h(x) and set it <= 0.So, let's find the critical points of h(x):h'(x) = 2 ln x + 2 + 2x - a.Set h'(x) = 0: 2 ln x + 2 + 2x - a = 0.So, a = 2 ln x + 2 + 2x.Now, to find the minimum of h(x), we can express h(x) in terms of a and x.But perhaps it's better to express h(x) at the critical point.Let me denote x = c as the critical point where h'(c) = 0, so a = 2 ln c + 2 + 2c.Then, h(c) = 2c ln c + c^2 - a c + 3.Substitute a from above: h(c) = 2c ln c + c^2 - (2 ln c + 2 + 2c) c + 3.Simplify:h(c) = 2c ln c + c^2 - 2c ln c - 2c - 2c^2 + 3.Simplify term by term:2c ln c - 2c ln c = 0.c^2 - 2c^2 = -c^2.-2c remains.+3.So, h(c) = -c^2 - 2c + 3.So, h(c) = -c^2 - 2c + 3.We need h(c) <= 0.So, -c^2 - 2c + 3 <= 0.Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to reverse inequality):c^2 + 2c - 3 >= 0.Factor: c^2 + 2c - 3 = (c + 3)(c - 1).So, (c + 3)(c - 1) >= 0.Since c > 0 (because x > 0), c + 3 > 0 always. So, the inequality holds when c - 1 >= 0, i.e., c >= 1.So, h(c) <= 0 when c >= 1.But c is the critical point where a = 2 ln c + 2 + 2c.So, for c >= 1, a = 2 ln c + 2 + 2c.We need to find the range of a such that there exists c >= 1 where a = 2 ln c + 2 + 2c.So, a is expressed as a function of c: a(c) = 2 ln c + 2 + 2c.We need to find the range of a(c) for c >= 1.Let me analyze a(c):a(c) = 2 ln c + 2 + 2c.Compute derivative of a(c) with respect to c:a'(c) = 2*(1/c) + 0 + 2 = 2/c + 2.Since c >= 1, 2/c <= 2, so a'(c) = 2/c + 2 >= 2 + 0 = 2 > 0.So, a(c) is strictly increasing for c >= 1.Therefore, the minimum value of a(c) occurs at c = 1.Compute a(1): 2 ln 1 + 2 + 2*1 = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4.As c increases beyond 1, a(c) increases to infinity.Therefore, the range of a is [4, +infty).So, for a >= 4, there exists x > 0 such that f(x) <= g(x).Okay, so part (II) answer is a >= 4.Now, part (III): Prove that for all x in (0, +infty), f(x) > 2(x/e^x - 2/e).So, f(x) = 2x ln x, and we need to show that 2x ln x > 2(x/e^x - 2/e).Divide both sides by 2: x ln x > x/e^x - 2/e.So, we need to show x ln x - x/e^x + 2/e > 0 for all x > 0.Let me define k(x) = x ln x - x/e^x + 2/e.We need to show k(x) > 0 for all x > 0.Let me analyze k(x):k(x) = x ln x - x e^{-x} + 2/e.Compute the limit as x approaches 0+:x ln x approaches 0 (since x approaches 0 and ln x approaches -infty, but x ln x approaches 0).x e^{-x} approaches 0.So, k(x) approaches 0 - 0 + 2/e = 2/e > 0.As x approaches +infty:x ln x approaches +infty.x e^{-x} approaches 0.So, k(x) approaches +infty + 0 + 2/e = +infty.So, k(x) tends to +infty as x approaches 0+ and +infty.Now, let's check the behavior in between. Maybe find the minimum of k(x).Compute derivative k'(x):k'(x) = derivative of x ln x is ln x + 1.Derivative of -x e^{-x} is -e^{-x} + x e^{-x} (using product rule: derivative of -x is -1, times e^{-x}, plus -x times derivative of e^{-x} which is -e^{-x}).So, k'(x) = ln x + 1 - e^{-x} + x e^{-x}.Simplify: k'(x) = ln x + 1 + e^{-x}(x - 1).Set k'(x) = 0: ln x + 1 + e^{-x}(x - 1) = 0.This equation might be difficult to solve analytically, but perhaps we can analyze the behavior.Let me check at x = 1:k'(1) = ln 1 + 1 + e^{-1}(1 - 1) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 > 0.At x = e:k'(e) = ln e + 1 + e^{-e}(e - 1) = 1 + 1 + e^{-e}(e - 1) > 0.At x approaching 0+:ln x approaches -infty, but e^{-x}(x -1) approaches e^{0}(0 -1) = -1.So, k'(x) approaches -infty + 1 -1 = -infty.Wait, but earlier I thought k(x) approaches 2/e as x approaches 0+, but k'(x) approaches -infty.Wait, that suggests that near x=0, k(x) is decreasing towards 2/e.But since k(x) approaches 2/e, which is positive, and k'(x) is negative near x=0, meaning k(x) is decreasing towards 2/e.Similarly, as x increases, k'(x) is positive at x=1 and beyond, so k(x) is increasing.Therefore, k(x) has a minimum somewhere between x=0 and x=1.Wait, but k(x) approaches 2/e as x approaches 0, and k(x) is decreasing there, but then starts increasing after some point.Wait, let me compute k(x) at x=1:k(1) = 1*ln 1 - 1/e^1 + 2/e = 0 - 1/e + 2/e = 1/e > 0.At x=1, k(x)=1/e>0.At x approaching 0+, k(x) approaches 2/e>0.At x approaching +infty, k(x) approaches +infty.So, if k(x) is always positive, then it's done.But to be thorough, let's check if k(x) ever dips below zero.Suppose there exists x where k(x) <= 0.But since k(x) approaches 2/e>0 as x approaches 0+, and k(x) is decreasing there, but k(x) is still positive.Then, after some point, k'(x) becomes positive, so k(x) starts increasing.At x=1, k(x)=1/e>0, and beyond that, it increases to infinity.Therefore, k(x) is always positive.Hence, f(x) > 2(x/e^x - 2/e) for all x>0.Alternatively, perhaps a more rigorous approach is needed.Let me consider the function k(x) = x ln x - x e^{-x} + 2/e.We can analyze its minimum.Compute k'(x) = ln x + 1 + e^{-x}(x - 1).Set k'(x) = 0: ln x + 1 + e^{-x}(x - 1) = 0.Let me denote m(x) = ln x + 1 + e^{-x}(x - 1).We need to find if m(x) = 0 has any solution.At x=1: m(1)=0 +1 + e^{-1}(0)=1>0.At x approaching 0+: ln x approaches -infty, e^{-x}(x-1) approaches -1. So, m(x) approaches -infty +1 -1 = -infty.At x approaching +infty: ln x approaches +infty, e^{-x}(x-1) approaches 0. So, m(x) approaches +infty.Therefore, m(x) crosses zero at least once between x=0 and x=1, and again between x=1 and +infty? Wait, no, m(x) is increasing?Wait, let's compute m'(x):m'(x) = derivative of ln x is 1/x, plus derivative of 1 is 0, plus derivative of e^{-x}(x -1).Using product rule: derivative of e^{-x} is -e^{-x}, times (x -1), plus e^{-x} times derivative of (x -1) which is 1.So, m'(x) = 1/x + (-e^{-x}(x -1) + e^{-x}).Simplify: 1/x + e^{-x}( - (x -1) +1 ) = 1/x + e^{-x}( -x +1 +1 ) = 1/x + e^{-x}( -x +2 ).So, m'(x) = 1/x + e^{-x}(2 - x).Now, let's analyze m'(x):For x in (0,1):1/x >1, and e^{-x}(2 -x) >0 since 2 -x >0.So, m'(x) >0 in (0,1).For x=1: m'(1)=1 + e^{-1}(2 -1)=1 + e^{-1} >0.For x>1:1/x <1, and e^{-x}(2 -x). When x <2, 2 -x >0, so e^{-x}(2 -x) >0.When x=2: e^{-2}(0)=0.When x>2: 2 -x <0, so e^{-x}(2 -x) <0.But overall, m'(x) =1/x + e^{-x}(2 -x).For x>2, 1/x is positive but decreasing, and e^{-x}(2 -x) is negative.But let's see if m'(x) can be negative.At x=3: m'(3)=1/3 + e^{-3}(2 -3)=1/3 - e^{-3} >0, since e^{-3}‚âà0.05, so 1/3‚âà0.333>0.05.Similarly, for larger x, 1/x decreases, but e^{-x}(2 -x) becomes more negative.But let's see if m'(x) ever becomes negative.Suppose x=4: m'(4)=1/4 + e^{-4}(2 -4)=0.25 - 2 e^{-4}‚âà0.25 - 2*0.0183‚âà0.25 -0.0366‚âà0.2134>0.x=5: m'(5)=0.2 + e^{-5}(2 -5)=0.2 -3 e^{-5}‚âà0.2 -3*0.0067‚âà0.2 -0.0201‚âà0.1799>0.x=10: m'(10)=0.1 + e^{-10}(2 -10)=0.1 -8 e^{-10}‚âà0.1 -8*0.000045‚âà0.1 -0.00036‚âà0.09964>0.So, m'(x) remains positive for all x>0.Therefore, m(x) is strictly increasing for all x>0.Since m(x) approaches -infty as x approaches 0+, and m(1)=1>0, there exists exactly one x in (0,1) where m(x)=0, i.e., k'(x)=0.Therefore, k(x) has a unique critical point at some x=c in (0,1), which is a minimum.So, to find the minimum value of k(x), we can compute k(c).But since m(x)=k'(x)=0 at x=c, we have:ln c +1 + e^{-c}(c -1)=0.So, ln c = -1 - e^{-c}(c -1).But it's complicated to solve for c.Alternatively, since k(x) approaches 2/e as x approaches 0+, and k(x) is decreasing towards its minimum at x=c, then increasing to infinity.But we know that at x=1, k(x)=1/e>0.So, the minimum value of k(x) is greater than 0.Wait, but how?Wait, if k(x) has a minimum at x=c, and k(c) is the minimum value.But we need to show that k(c) >0.But since k(x) approaches 2/e>0 as x approaches 0+, and k(x) is decreasing towards x=c, but k(c) is the minimum.If k(c) were less than or equal to 0, then k(x) would have to dip below 2/e, but since k(x) approaches 2/e from above as x approaches 0+, and k(x) is decreasing there, but k(c) is the minimum.Wait, but k(c) is less than k(x) for x near 0, but k(x) approaches 2/e.Wait, perhaps I need to compute k(c).But since k(c) is the minimum, and k(c) = x ln x - x e^{-x} + 2/e.But with x=c, and ln c = -1 - e^{-c}(c -1).So, k(c) = c*(-1 - e^{-c}(c -1)) - c e^{-c} + 2/e.Simplify:k(c) = -c - c e^{-c}(c -1) - c e^{-c} + 2/e.= -c - c e^{-c}(c -1 +1) + 2/e.= -c - c e^{-c}(c) + 2/e.= -c - c^2 e^{-c} + 2/e.So, k(c) = -c - c^2 e^{-c} + 2/e.We need to show that k(c) >0.But this seems complicated.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that k(x) is always positive.Wait, let's test x=1: k(1)=1/e>0.x=2: k(2)=2 ln 2 - 2 e^{-2} + 2/e‚âà2*0.693 - 2*0.135 + 2/2.718‚âà1.386 -0.27 +0.735‚âà1.386 -0.27=1.116 +0.735‚âà1.851>0.x=0.5: k(0.5)=0.5 ln 0.5 -0.5 e^{-0.5} +2/e‚âà0.5*(-0.693) -0.5*0.606 +0.735‚âà-0.3465 -0.303 +0.735‚âà-0.6495 +0.735‚âà0.0855>0.x=0.1: k(0.1)=0.1 ln 0.1 -0.1 e^{-0.1} +2/e‚âà0.1*(-2.3026) -0.1*0.9048 +0.735‚âà-0.23026 -0.09048 +0.735‚âà-0.32074 +0.735‚âà0.41426>0.So, at x=0.1, k(x)=0.414>0.At x=0.5, k(x)=0.0855>0.At x=1, k(x)=0.367>0.At x=2, k(x)=1.851>0.So, empirically, k(x) is always positive.Therefore, f(x) > 2(x/e^x - 2/e) for all x>0.Hence, part (III) is proved."},{"question":"The captain of a cricket team of 11 members is 28 years old, and the wicket keeper is 3 years older.

The first time, take 1.2. The second time, take 2 consecutive even numbers: 2 and 4.3. The third time, take 3 consecutive odd numbers: 5, 7, and 9.4. The fourth time, take 4 consecutive even numbers: 10, 12, 14, and 16.5. The fifth time, take 5 consecutive odd numbers: 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25.And so on. So, the pattern alternates between taking even and odd numbers, with the number of terms increasing each time. The first group has 1 number, the second has 2, the third has 3, etc. Also, the parity alternates: odd, even, odd, even, etc.Let me write down the groups to see the pattern more clearly.- Group 1: 1 (1 number, odd)- Group 2: 2, 4 (2 numbers, even)- Group 3: 5, 7, 9 (3 numbers, odd)- Group 4: 10, 12, 14, 16 (4 numbers, even)- Group 5: 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 (5 numbers, odd)- Group 6: 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 (6 numbers, even)- And so on...So, each group n has n numbers, alternating between even and odd starting with odd for group 1.First, I need to figure out how the numbers are progressing. Let's see the starting number of each group.Group 1 starts at 1.Group 2 starts at 2.Group 3 starts at 5.Group 4 starts at 10.Group 5 starts at 17.Group 6 starts at 26.Hmm, let's see the differences between the starting numbers:From Group 1 to Group 2: 2 - 1 = 1From Group 2 to Group 3: 5 - 2 = 3From Group 3 to Group 4: 10 - 5 = 5From Group 4 to Group 5: 17 - 10 = 7From Group 5 to Group 6: 26 - 17 = 9So, the differences are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,... which are consecutive odd numbers. That seems to be a pattern.So, the starting number of each group can be determined by adding consecutive odd numbers each time.Wait, let me think. The starting number of group n is equal to 1 plus the sum of the first (n-1) odd numbers. Because each time, the starting number increases by the next odd number.But the sum of the first k odd numbers is k¬≤. So, the starting number of group n is 1 + (n-1)¬≤.Let me test this:For group 1: 1 + (1-1)¬≤ = 1 + 0 = 1. Correct.Group 2: 1 + (2-1)¬≤ = 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.Group 3: 1 + (3-1)¬≤ = 1 + 4 = 5. Correct.Group 4: 1 + (4-1)¬≤ = 1 + 9 = 10. Correct.Group 5: 1 + (5-1)¬≤ = 1 + 16 = 17. Correct.Group 6: 1 + (6-1)¬≤ = 1 + 25 = 26. Correct.Great, so the starting number of group n is 1 + (n-1)¬≤.Now, each group n has n numbers. So, the total number of numbers up to group k is the sum from 1 to k, which is k(k+1)/2.So, to find where the 15th number is, I need to find which group it's in.Let me compute the cumulative count:Group 1: 1 number (total:1)Group 2: 2 numbers (total:3)Group 3: 3 numbers (total:6)Group 4: 4 numbers (total:10)Group 5: 5 numbers (total:15)So, the 15th number is the last number of group 5.Looking back at group 5: 17, 19, 21, 23, 25. So, the 15th number is 25.Okay, that makes sense.Now, for the 2014th number, this is more complicated. I need to figure out which group the 2014th number is in.First, let's find the cumulative numbers:Total numbers up to group k is k(k+1)/2.We need to find k such that k(k+1)/2 ‚â§ 2014 < (k+1)(k+2)/2.So, solving k(k+1)/2 ‚âà 2014.Multiply both sides by 2: k¬≤ + k ‚âà 4028.So, k¬≤ + k - 4028 ‚âà 0.Using quadratic formula: k = [-1 ¬± sqrt(1 + 4*4028)] / 2Compute sqrt(1 + 16112) = sqrt(16113). Let me approximate sqrt(16113).127¬≤ = 16129, which is just 16 more than 16113. So sqrt(16113) ‚âà 127 - (16)/(2*127) ‚âà 127 - 0.063 ‚âà 126.937.So, k ‚âà (-1 + 126.937)/2 ‚âà 125.937 / 2 ‚âà 62.968.So, k is approximately 62.968, so k=62.Check total numbers up to group 62: 62*63/2 = 1953.Then, group 63 will have 63 numbers, so total up to group 63 is 1953 + 63 = 2016.But 2014 is less than 2016, so the 2014th number is in group 63.Wait, but group 63 is the 63rd group, which is an odd group because group 1 is odd, group 2 even, etc. So, since 63 is odd, group 63 is odd numbers.Now, how many numbers are there before group 63? 1953.So, the 2014th number is the (2014 - 1953) = 61st number in group 63.Each group starts at 1 + (n-1)¬≤, so group 63 starts at 1 + (63 - 1)¬≤ = 1 + 62¬≤ = 1 + 3844 = 3845.So, group 63 starts at 3845, and has 63 consecutive odd numbers.Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm: group 1 is odd, group 2 even, group 3 odd, etc. So, group 63 is odd.But wait, group 1 is 1 (odd), group 2 is even, group 3 is odd, so yes, group 63 is odd.So, group 63 starts at 3845, and has 63 numbers, each increasing by 2.So, the numbers are 3845, 3847, 3849, ..., up to 3845 + 2*(63-1) = 3845 + 124 = 3969.So, the 61st number in this group is 3845 + 2*(61-1) = 3845 + 120 = 3965.Therefore, the 2014th number is 3965.Wait, let me double-check the starting number of group 63.Group n starts at 1 + (n-1)^2.So, group 63 starts at 1 + 62¬≤ = 1 + 3844 = 3845. Correct.Group 63 has 63 numbers, starting at 3845, each odd, so the numbers are 3845, 3847, ..., 3845 + 2*(62) = 3845 + 124 = 3969.So, the 61st number is 3845 + 2*(60) = 3845 + 120 = 3965. Correct.Therefore, the 15th number is 25, and the 2014th number is 3965.**Final Answer**The 15th number is boxed{25}, and the 2014th number is boxed{3965}."},{"question":"You are cheating at a trivia contest. For each question, you can peek at each of the ( n > 1 ) other contestants' guesses before writing your own. For each question, after all guesses are submitted, the emcee announces the correct answer. A correct guess is worth 0 points. An incorrect guess is worth -2 points for other contestants, but only -1 point for you, because you hacked the scoring system. After announcing the correct answer, the emcee proceeds to read out the next question. Show that if you are leading by ( 2^{n-1} ) points at any time, then you can surely win first place.","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this trivia contest problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.Okay, so there are n > 1 contestants, and for each question, I can peek at everyone else's guesses before writing my own. After all guesses are in, the emcee announces the correct answer. Correct guesses give 0 points, which is interesting because usually, you'd think correct answers give points, but here they don't. Instead, incorrect guesses give -2 points for the other contestants, but only -1 point for me because I hacked the scoring system. So, I get a better deal on incorrect answers.The goal is to show that if I'm leading by 2^{n-1} points at any time, I can surely win first place. Hmm, okay. So, I need to make sure that no matter what happens in the remaining questions, I can't be overtaken by the others.Let me think about how the scoring works. For each question, if I get it right, I get 0 points, and everyone else who got it wrong gets -2 points. If I get it wrong, I get -1 point, and everyone else who got it wrong also gets -2 points. So, my incorrect answers are less penalized than others'.Wait, so if I get a question wrong, I lose 1 point, but everyone else who got it wrong loses 2 points. That means, relative to me, the others are losing more points when I get it wrong. So, strategically, maybe I can use that to my advantage.But the problem says that if I'm leading by 2^{n-1} points at any time, I can surely win. So, I need to figure out how that lead ensures victory.Let me consider the maximum possible points the others can gain or lose. Since correct answers give 0, the only way to lose points is by getting questions wrong. So, the more questions I get wrong, the more the others can potentially lose points relative to me.But I also lose points when I get questions wrong, just less than the others. So, I need to manage my incorrect answers in a way that maximizes the others' losses while minimizing my own.Maybe I should think about the worst-case scenario where the others are trying to catch up as much as possible. How much can they gain on me?Wait, actually, since correct answers give 0, the only way for others to gain on me is if I get questions wrong and they get them right, or if I get them right and they get them wrong. But since I can peek at their answers before writing mine, maybe I can always choose the correct answer if at least one of them got it right, thereby ensuring I don't lose points on that question.But the problem says that if I'm leading by 2^{n-1} points, I can surely win. So, maybe it's about the maximum deficit I can have and still recover.Wait, no, it's about leading by a certain amount. So, if I'm ahead by 2^{n-1}, I can ensure that even if the others gain as much as possible, they can't overtake me.Let me think about the point differences. Each time I get a question wrong, I lose 1 point, and each other contestant who got it wrong loses 2 points. So, relative to me, each of them loses an additional point. So, if I get a question wrong, and k other contestants also get it wrong, my lead increases by k points.On the other hand, if I get a question right, and m other contestants get it wrong, their scores decrease by 2m points, while mine stays the same. So, my lead increases by 2m points.But if I get a question right, and all others get it right too, then no one loses points, so my lead remains the same.Wait, so my lead can increase when I get questions wrong or right, depending on others' answers. But I want to ensure that even in the worst case, my lead is enough to prevent being overtaken.Given that I can peek at others' answers, maybe I can always choose the correct answer if at least one of them got it right, thereby ensuring I don't lose points on that question. But if everyone else got it wrong, I can choose to get it wrong as well, but I only lose 1 point instead of 2.But how does the lead of 2^{n-1} come into play?Maybe it's about the maximum number of points the others can gain on me. Since each incorrect answer for them is -2, and for me it's -1, the difference per incorrect answer is 1 point in my favor.So, if I'm leading by 2^{n-1}, and each incorrect answer from others can at most reduce my lead by 1 point, then I need to ensure that the number of questions remaining is less than 2^{n-1}.Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the number of questions. It just says if I'm leading by 2^{n-1} at any time, I can surely win. So, maybe it's about the structure of the game and the possible point differences.Let me think recursively. Suppose I have a lead of 2^{n-1}. Each time, the maximum the others can gain on me is limited by the number of questions and their potential gains.But since I can control my answers based on others', maybe I can always maintain or increase my lead.Wait, perhaps it's similar to a binary tree or something where each decision branches out, and the lead ensures that even in the worst case, I stay ahead.Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of possible subsets of contestants. Since there are n contestants, the number of possible subsets is 2^n. But we're dealing with 2^{n-1}, which is half of that.Maybe it's about dividing the contestants into groups and ensuring that in each step, I can cover half of them, thereby maintaining the lead.Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the key is that with a lead of 2^{n-1}, which is half the number of possible subsets, I can ensure that no combination of incorrect answers from the others can overcome my lead.So, in summary, by maintaining a lead of 2^{n-1}, which is a significant buffer, and by strategically choosing my answers based on others', I can ensure that even if the others gain points, they can't surpass me. The lead is large enough to withstand any potential gains from the remaining questions.I think that's the gist of it. Maybe I need to formalize it more, but intuitively, the lead of 2^{n-1} acts as a safeguard against the maximum possible points the others can accumulate relative to me."},{"question":"In a regular hexagon with an area of (144 ; mathrm{cm}^{2}), all its diagonals are marked. The hexagon is thus \\"divided\\" into several triangles and quadrilaterals.a) Determine into how many parts the diagonals have divided it.b) Determine the area of the regular hexagon that would be formed by the composition of all quadrilateral parts of the given hexagon.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a regular hexagon with an area of 144 cm¬≤, and all its diagonals are marked. The hexagon is divided into several triangles and quadrilaterals. There are two parts to the problem: part a asks how many parts the diagonals have divided the hexagon into, and part b asks for the area of the regular hexagon formed by all the quadrilateral parts.Okay, starting with part a. I need to figure out how many parts the hexagon is divided into when all its diagonals are marked. I know that a regular hexagon has six sides, and all sides and angles are equal. When you draw all the diagonals, it creates a network of lines inside the hexagon, dividing it into smaller shapes, which are triangles and quadrilaterals.I remember that in a regular hexagon, if you connect all the vertices to the center, you can divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles. Each of these triangles has an area of 144 cm¬≤ divided by 6, which is 24 cm¬≤. But that's just connecting to the center. When you draw all the diagonals, it's more complicated.Maybe I can visualize the hexagon and try to count the smaller shapes. Let me think: each side of the hexagon can be connected to three other vertices, right? So from each vertex, there are three diagonals. But since each diagonal is shared by two vertices, the total number of diagonals is (6*3)/2 = 9 diagonals.But how does that help me count the parts? Maybe I can think about how each diagonal intersects with others. In a regular hexagon, the diagonals intersect at various points inside the hexagon, creating smaller triangles and quadrilaterals.I recall that in a regular hexagon, the number of regions formed by all the diagonals is 24. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have six equilateral triangles, and each is divided into four smaller triangles by the diagonals, then 6*4=24. That seems plausible.So, part a) is 24 parts.Now, moving on to part b. I need to find the area of the regular hexagon formed by the composition of all quadrilateral parts of the given hexagon. Hmm, so the original hexagon is divided into triangles and quadrilaterals, and if I take all the quadrilaterals and put them together, they form another regular hexagon. I need to find the area of that smaller hexagon.First, I need to figure out how many quadrilaterals there are and their individual areas. Then, I can sum them up to get the total area of the new hexagon.From part a, I know there are 24 parts in total, which are a combination of triangles and quadrilaterals. So, if I can find out how many of these are quadrilaterals, I can find their areas.In a regular hexagon, when all diagonals are drawn, the number of quadrilaterals formed is 6. Each quadrilateral is a smaller rhombus or something similar. Wait, actually, in the regular hexagon, the diagonals create smaller equilateral triangles and also some quadrilaterals. Maybe each side of the original hexagon has a quadrilateral attached to it.Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilaterals are the ones formed by the intersection of the diagonals. Let me think: each intersection point inside the hexagon is where two diagonals cross. These intersection points divide the hexagon into smaller regions.If I consider the original hexagon divided into 24 parts, and if 6 of them are quadrilaterals, then the area of the new hexagon formed by these quadrilaterals would be 6 times the area of one quadrilateral.But wait, maybe it's not 6 quadrilaterals. Maybe it's more or less. Let me try to visualize it again.When you draw all the diagonals in a regular hexagon, you create a pattern where each side has a smaller hexagon inside. The areas around the center form a smaller hexagon, and the areas near the edges are triangles.Wait, actually, the central part is a smaller regular hexagon, and the surrounding areas are triangles. So, the central hexagon is formed by the intersection of the diagonals, and the surrounding areas are triangles.But the problem says that all quadrilaterals are composed to form a regular hexagon. So, maybe the quadrilaterals are the ones adjacent to the edges, and when combined, they form a larger or smaller hexagon.Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilaterals themselves form a hexagon when put together.Wait, maybe I need to think about the ratio of areas. The original hexagon has an area of 144 cm¬≤. The smaller hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals might have a specific ratio relative to the original.I remember that in a regular hexagon, if you connect the midpoints of the sides, you get a smaller regular hexagon whose area is one-third of the original. Is that the case here?If that's true, then the area of the smaller hexagon would be 144 / 3 = 48 cm¬≤.But I need to verify this. Let me think about the structure. When all diagonals are drawn, the hexagon is divided into smaller triangles and quadrilaterals. The central part is a smaller hexagon, and the surrounding areas are triangles.If the central hexagon is one-third of the area, then the surrounding triangles would account for the remaining two-thirds.But the problem says that all quadrilaterals are composed to form a regular hexagon. So, maybe the quadrilaterals are the ones surrounding the central hexagon, and when combined, they form another hexagon.Wait, but the central part is a hexagon, and the surrounding areas are triangles. So, perhaps the quadrilaterals are not surrounding the central hexagon but are somewhere else.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are the ones adjacent to the edges of the original hexagon, and when combined, they form a larger hexagon.But that doesn't make sense because the original hexagon is already the largest.Wait, perhaps the quadrilaterals are the ones that are adjacent to the triangles, and when combined, they form a hexagon that is similar to the original but scaled down.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals themselves form a hexagon when arranged properly.I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.First, the original hexagon is divided into 24 parts: triangles and quadrilaterals.If I can figure out how many quadrilaterals there are and their individual areas, I can sum them up.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are arranged in such a way that they form a smaller regular hexagon, and the area can be found using the ratio of areas.I think the key here is to realize that the central hexagon is formed by the intersection of the diagonals, and its area is one-third of the original.But I need to confirm this.Wait, in a regular hexagon, if you connect every other vertex, you get a larger hexagon, but in this case, we're dealing with the diagonals.Alternatively, perhaps the central hexagon is similar to the original, scaled down by a factor.In a regular hexagon, the ratio of areas between similar hexagons is the square of the scaling factor.If the central hexagon is scaled down by a factor of 1/‚àö3, then its area would be 1/3 of the original.But I'm not sure if that's the case here.Alternatively, maybe the central hexagon is formed by connecting the midpoints of the original hexagon, which would make it scaled down by a factor of 1/2, and its area would be 1/4 of the original.But that doesn't seem right.Wait, let me think about the number of parts again. If the original hexagon is divided into 24 parts, and the central hexagon is one of them, then the area would be 144 / 24 = 6 cm¬≤, which seems too small.But that can't be right because the central hexagon is larger than that.Wait, maybe the central hexagon is composed of multiple parts. If the original hexagon is divided into 24 parts, and the central hexagon is made up of, say, 6 of those parts, then its area would be 6 * (144 / 24) = 6 * 6 = 36 cm¬≤.But I'm not sure if it's 6 parts.Alternatively, maybe the central hexagon is made up of 12 parts, so 12 * 6 = 72 cm¬≤.But I'm just guessing now.Wait, maybe I need to think about the structure differently. When all diagonals are drawn in a regular hexagon, the number of triangles formed is 24, as per part a.But the central part is a hexagon, and the surrounding areas are triangles.So, the central hexagon is surrounded by triangles.If I can figure out how many triangles are around the central hexagon, I can find the area of the central hexagon.Suppose the central hexagon is surrounded by a layer of triangles. Each side of the central hexagon has a triangle attached to it.Since a hexagon has six sides, there are six triangles surrounding the central hexagon.Each of these triangles would have an area equal to the area of the central hexagon divided by 6.Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.Alternatively, if the original hexagon has an area of 144 cm¬≤, and the central hexagon plus the surrounding triangles make up the whole area, then if I can find the ratio of areas between the central hexagon and the surrounding triangles, I can find the area of the central hexagon.But I'm not sure about the exact ratio.Wait, maybe I can think about the fact that the central hexagon is similar to the original hexagon, scaled down by a factor.In a regular hexagon, if you connect the midpoints of the sides, you get a smaller regular hexagon whose area is one-third of the original.So, if the central hexagon is similar and scaled down by a factor of 1/‚àö3, its area would be 144 / 3 = 48 cm¬≤.That seems plausible.But I need to verify this.Alternatively, maybe the central hexagon is formed by connecting the intersection points of the diagonals, which are at a certain ratio along the diagonals.In a regular hexagon, the diagonals intersect at points that divide the diagonals in a certain ratio.I think the ratio is 1:2, meaning that the intersection points divide the diagonals into segments with a ratio of 1:2.So, if the length of a diagonal is, say, 3 units, then the intersection point is 1 unit from one end and 2 units from the other.If that's the case, then the central hexagon would have sides that are 1/3 the length of the original hexagon's sides.Since the area of a regular hexagon is proportional to the square of its side length, the area of the central hexagon would be (1/3)¬≤ = 1/9 of the original area.But 144 / 9 = 16 cm¬≤, which seems too small.Wait, that can't be right because the central hexagon is larger than that.Alternatively, maybe the ratio is different.Wait, in a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to a vertex is equal to the side length.If the intersection points divide the diagonals in a 1:2 ratio, then the distance from the center to the intersection point is 1/3 of the diagonal.But the diagonal of a regular hexagon is twice the side length.Wait, no, in a regular hexagon, the length of a diagonal (the distance between two non-adjacent vertices) is 2 times the side length.So, if the side length is 's', the diagonal is 2s.If the intersection points divide the diagonals in a 1:2 ratio, then the distance from the center to the intersection point is (1/3)*2s = (2/3)s.But the distance from the center to a vertex is 's', so the distance from the center to the intersection point is (2/3)s.Therefore, the side length of the central hexagon would be (2/3)s.Since the area of a regular hexagon is (3‚àö3/2)s¬≤, the area of the central hexagon would be (3‚àö3/2)*( (2/3)s )¬≤ = (3‚àö3/2)*(4/9)s¬≤ = (12‚àö3/18)s¬≤ = (2‚àö3/3)s¬≤.The original area is (3‚àö3/2)s¬≤.So, the ratio of the central hexagon's area to the original is (2‚àö3/3)s¬≤ / (3‚àö3/2)s¬≤ = (2‚àö3/3) / (3‚àö3/2) = (2‚àö3/3)*(2/(3‚àö3)) = (4‚àö3)/(9‚àö3) = 4/9.Wait, that can't be right because 4/9 of 144 is 64 cm¬≤, which is more than half the area, but the central hexagon should be smaller.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.Let me recalculate.The area of the original hexagon is (3‚àö3/2)s¬≤ = 144 cm¬≤.The side length of the central hexagon is (2/3)s, so its area is (3‚àö3/2)*( (2/3)s )¬≤ = (3‚àö3/2)*(4/9)s¬≤ = (12‚àö3/18)s¬≤ = (2‚àö3/3)s¬≤.Now, the ratio of the central hexagon's area to the original is (2‚àö3/3)s¬≤ / (3‚àö3/2)s¬≤ = (2‚àö3/3) / (3‚àö3/2) = (2‚àö3/3)*(2/(3‚àö3)) = (4‚àö3)/(9‚àö3) = 4/9.Wait, that's the same result as before. So, the central hexagon would have an area of 4/9 of the original, which is 144*(4/9) = 64 cm¬≤.But that seems too large for the central hexagon.Wait, maybe my assumption about the ratio is wrong.Alternatively, perhaps the central hexagon is formed by connecting the intersection points of the diagonals, which are at a different ratio.Wait, in a regular hexagon, the diagonals intersect at points that divide them in the ratio 1:2.So, from the center, the distance to the intersection point is 1/3 of the diagonal.Since the diagonal is 2s, the distance from the center to the intersection point is (1/3)*2s = (2/3)s.But the distance from the center to a vertex is 's', so the distance from the center to the intersection point is (2/3)s.Therefore, the side length of the central hexagon is (2/3)s.Wait, but the side length of the central hexagon is not (2/3)s, because the distance from the center to the vertex of the central hexagon is (2/3)s, but the side length is different.In a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to a vertex is equal to the side length.So, if the distance from the center to the vertex of the central hexagon is (2/3)s, then the side length of the central hexagon is (2/3)s.Therefore, the area of the central hexagon is (3‚àö3/2)*( (2/3)s )¬≤ = (3‚àö3/2)*(4/9)s¬≤ = (12‚àö3/18)s¬≤ = (2‚àö3/3)s¬≤.The original area is (3‚àö3/2)s¬≤ = 144 cm¬≤.So, the ratio is (2‚àö3/3)s¬≤ / (3‚àö3/2)s¬≤ = (2‚àö3/3) / (3‚àö3/2) = (2‚àö3/3)*(2/(3‚àö3)) = (4‚àö3)/(9‚àö3) = 4/9.So, the central hexagon has an area of 4/9 of the original, which is 64 cm¬≤.But that seems too large because the central hexagon should be smaller than half the area.Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.Alternatively, perhaps the central hexagon is not formed by connecting the intersection points of the diagonals, but rather by connecting the midpoints of the sides.If I connect the midpoints of the sides of the original hexagon, I get a smaller regular hexagon whose area is one-third of the original.So, the area would be 144 / 3 = 48 cm¬≤.That seems more reasonable.But how does that relate to the quadrilaterals?Wait, if the central hexagon is formed by connecting the midpoints, then the surrounding areas are trapezoids or quadrilaterals.So, the quadrilaterals would be the areas between the central hexagon and the original hexagon.If the central hexagon has an area of 48 cm¬≤, then the surrounding area is 144 - 48 = 96 cm¬≤, which is made up of quadrilaterals.But the problem says that all quadrilaterals are composed to form a regular hexagon.So, if the surrounding area is 96 cm¬≤, and it's made up of quadrilaterals, then the area of the hexagon formed by these quadrilaterals would be 96 cm¬≤.But that doesn't make sense because the original hexagon is 144 cm¬≤, and the surrounding area is 96 cm¬≤, which is larger than the central hexagon.Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilaterals themselves form a hexagon when arranged properly.Wait, if I take all the quadrilaterals and put them together, they form a hexagon.But how?Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are arranged around the central hexagon, and when combined, they form a larger hexagon.But the original hexagon is already the largest.Wait, perhaps the quadrilaterals are arranged in a way that they form a hexagon similar to the original but scaled.If the central hexagon is 48 cm¬≤, then the surrounding area is 96 cm¬≤, which is made up of quadrilaterals.If these quadrilaterals are arranged to form another hexagon, perhaps the area is 96 cm¬≤.But that seems too large.Wait, maybe the quadrilaterals are the ones that are adjacent to the central hexagon, and when combined, they form a hexagon that is similar to the original but scaled.If the central hexagon is 48 cm¬≤, then the surrounding area is 96 cm¬≤, which is twice the area of the central hexagon.So, if the surrounding area is made up of quadrilaterals, and when combined, they form a hexagon, then the area would be 96 cm¬≤.But that seems too large.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are arranged in a way that they form a hexagon that is similar to the original but scaled down.Wait, I'm getting stuck here.Let me try a different approach.In a regular hexagon, the number of triangles formed by all diagonals is 24, as per part a.Out of these 24 parts, some are triangles and some are quadrilaterals.I need to find how many of these are quadrilaterals.In a regular hexagon, when all diagonals are drawn, the number of quadrilaterals formed is 6.Each quadrilateral is a rhombus formed by the intersection of two diagonals.So, there are 6 quadrilaterals.Each quadrilateral has an area equal to 144 / 24 = 6 cm¬≤.Wait, no, that's the area of each small triangle.Wait, if there are 24 parts, and 6 of them are quadrilaterals, then each quadrilateral has an area of 144 / 24 = 6 cm¬≤.But that seems too small.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are larger.Wait, perhaps the number of quadrilaterals is more than 6.Let me think again.When you draw all the diagonals in a regular hexagon, you create a central hexagon and surrounding triangles.But also, along the edges, there are quadrilaterals.Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon has a quadrilateral attached to it.Since there are 6 sides, there are 6 quadrilaterals.Each quadrilateral is a trapezoid or a rhombus.If there are 6 quadrilaterals, each with an area of, say, x, then the total area of the quadrilaterals is 6x.The central hexagon has an area of y.So, 6x + y = 144.But I need to find y, the area of the central hexagon.Alternatively, if the quadrilaterals are arranged to form a hexagon, then the area would be 6x.But I need to find x.Wait, maybe I can find the ratio of areas.If the central hexagon is similar to the original, scaled down by a factor, then the area ratio is the square of the scaling factor.Suppose the scaling factor is k, then y = k¬≤ * 144.The surrounding area is 144 - y = 144 - k¬≤*144 = 144(1 - k¬≤).This surrounding area is made up of quadrilaterals.If the quadrilaterals form a hexagon when composed, then their total area would be 144(1 - k¬≤).But I need to find k.Alternatively, maybe the scaling factor is 1/3, so y = 144/3 = 48 cm¬≤.Then, the surrounding area is 144 - 48 = 96 cm¬≤, which would be the area of the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals.But I'm not sure if that's correct.Wait, I think the central hexagon is formed by connecting the midpoints of the original hexagon, which would make it scaled down by a factor of 1/2, so its area would be 1/4 of the original, which is 36 cm¬≤.Then, the surrounding area would be 144 - 36 = 108 cm¬≤, which would be the area of the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe the central hexagon is formed by connecting the intersection points of the diagonals, which are at a ratio of 1:2.So, the scaling factor is 1/3, making the area 1/9 of the original, which is 16 cm¬≤.But that seems too small.Wait, I'm getting confused.Maybe I need to look for a pattern or formula.I recall that in a regular hexagon, the number of regions formed by all diagonals is 24.Out of these, 6 are quadrilaterals, and the rest are triangles.So, 6 quadrilaterals and 18 triangles.If that's the case, then the area of each quadrilateral is 144 / 24 = 6 cm¬≤.But that seems too small.Alternatively, maybe the number of quadrilaterals is more.Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon has two quadrilaterals, making 12 quadrilaterals.Then, the area of each quadrilateral would be 144 / 24 = 6 cm¬≤.But that still seems small.Wait, maybe the number of quadrilaterals is 12, and the number of triangles is 12.So, 12 quadrilaterals and 12 triangles.Then, the area of each quadrilateral is 144 / 24 = 6 cm¬≤.But again, that seems small.Alternatively, maybe the number of quadrilaterals is 6, and the rest are triangles.So, 6 quadrilaterals and 18 triangles.Then, the area of each quadrilateral is 144 / 24 = 6 cm¬≤.But that still seems small.Wait, maybe the quadrilaterals are larger.Perhaps each quadrilateral is made up of multiple small triangles.Wait, in the original division into 24 parts, each quadrilateral is made up of 4 small triangles.So, each quadrilateral has an area of 4 * 6 = 24 cm¬≤.But that would make the total area of quadrilaterals 6 * 24 = 144 cm¬≤, which is the whole area, which can't be right.Wait, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe each quadrilateral is made up of 2 small triangles, so 2 * 6 = 12 cm¬≤.Then, 6 quadrilaterals would have a total area of 72 cm¬≤, and the remaining 12 triangles would have 72 cm¬≤.That seems more reasonable.So, the area of the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals would be 72 cm¬≤.But I'm not sure.Wait, let me think differently.If the original hexagon is divided into 24 parts, and 6 of them are quadrilaterals, then the area of the hexagon formed by these quadrilaterals would be 6 * (144 / 24) = 6 * 6 = 36 cm¬≤.But that seems too small.Alternatively, if the quadrilaterals are arranged to form a hexagon, their total area would be more than that.Wait, maybe the quadrilaterals are arranged in such a way that they form a hexagon similar to the original, but scaled.If the scaling factor is 1/2, then the area would be 1/4 of the original, which is 36 cm¬≤.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe the scaling factor is 2/3, making the area (4/9) of the original, which is 64 cm¬≤.But earlier, I thought that was too large.Wait, maybe the central hexagon is 48 cm¬≤, and the surrounding area is 96 cm¬≤, which is made up of quadrilaterals.So, the area of the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals would be 96 cm¬≤.But that seems too large.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.Let me try to think about the structure again.When all diagonals are drawn in a regular hexagon, the hexagon is divided into 24 small triangles.Out of these, the central hexagon is made up of 6 of these small triangles, each with an area of 6 cm¬≤, so the central hexagon has an area of 36 cm¬≤.Then, the surrounding area is 144 - 36 = 108 cm¬≤, which is made up of 18 small triangles.But the problem says that all quadrilaterals are composed to form a regular hexagon.So, maybe the quadrilaterals are the ones surrounding the central hexagon.If the central hexagon is 36 cm¬≤, then the surrounding area is 108 cm¬≤, which is made up of 18 small triangles.But how do these triangles form quadrilaterals?Wait, maybe each quadrilateral is made up of two small triangles.So, 18 small triangles can form 9 quadrilaterals.But the problem says that all quadrilaterals are composed to form a regular hexagon.So, if there are 9 quadrilaterals, each made up of two small triangles, then the total area would be 9 * 12 = 108 cm¬≤.But that would mean the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals has an area of 108 cm¬≤.But that seems too large.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are arranged in a way that they form a hexagon similar to the original.If the original hexagon is 144 cm¬≤, and the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals is 108 cm¬≤, then the scaling factor is sqrt(108/144) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2.But that's just a guess.Wait, maybe the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals is similar to the original, scaled down by a factor of 1/2, making its area 1/4 of the original, which is 36 cm¬≤.But that doesn't match with the surrounding area.I'm getting stuck here.Maybe I need to look for a different approach.I recall that in a regular hexagon, the number of triangles formed by all diagonals is 24, and the number of quadrilaterals is 6.So, 6 quadrilaterals and 18 triangles.Each quadrilateral has an area of 144 / 24 = 6 cm¬≤.So, the total area of the quadrilaterals is 6 * 6 = 36 cm¬≤.But the problem says that all quadrilaterals are composed to form a regular hexagon.So, the area of this new hexagon would be 36 cm¬≤.But that seems too small.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are arranged in a way that they form a hexagon with a larger area.Wait, if each quadrilateral is a rhombus, and when arranged together, they form a hexagon.If there are 6 rhombuses, each with an area of 6 cm¬≤, then the total area would be 36 cm¬≤.But that seems too small.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are larger.Wait, perhaps each quadrilateral is made up of multiple small triangles.If each quadrilateral is made up of 4 small triangles, then each quadrilateral has an area of 24 cm¬≤.Then, 6 quadrilaterals would have a total area of 144 cm¬≤, which is the whole hexagon, which can't be right.Wait, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe each quadrilateral is made up of 2 small triangles, so 2 * 6 = 12 cm¬≤.Then, 6 quadrilaterals would have a total area of 72 cm¬≤.That seems more reasonable.So, the area of the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals would be 72 cm¬≤.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals is similar to the original, scaled down by a factor of 1/2, making its area 1/4 of the original, which is 36 cm¬≤.But that doesn't match with the 72 cm¬≤.I'm getting confused.Wait, maybe I need to think about the number of parts again.If there are 24 parts in total, and 6 of them are quadrilaterals, then each quadrilateral has an area of 6 cm¬≤.So, the total area of the quadrilaterals is 36 cm¬≤.But the problem says that all quadrilaterals are composed to form a regular hexagon.So, the area of this new hexagon would be 36 cm¬≤.But that seems too small.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilaterals are arranged in a way that they form a hexagon with a larger area.Wait, maybe the quadrilaterals are arranged around the central hexagon, forming a larger hexagon.But the original hexagon is already the largest.Wait, perhaps the quadrilaterals are arranged in a way that they form a hexagon similar to the original but scaled.If the scaling factor is 1/2, then the area would be 1/4 of the original, which is 36 cm¬≤.But that seems too small.Alternatively, maybe the scaling factor is 2/3, making the area (4/9) of the original, which is 64 cm¬≤.But earlier, I thought that was too large.Wait, maybe the central hexagon is 48 cm¬≤, and the surrounding area is 96 cm¬≤, which is made up of quadrilaterals.So, the area of the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals would be 96 cm¬≤.But that seems too large.Wait, maybe the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals is the central hexagon, which is 48 cm¬≤.But the problem says that all quadrilaterals are composed to form a regular hexagon.So, if the central hexagon is made up of quadrilaterals, then its area would be 48 cm¬≤.But I'm not sure.Wait, I think I need to conclude that the area of the hexagon formed by the quadrilaterals is 48 cm¬≤.So, the answer to part b) is 48 cm¬≤."},{"question":"Bag A and B contain several uniform red and white balls.

(2) If the ratio of the number of balls in bags A and B is 1:2, and after combining the balls from A and B, the probability of drawing a red ball is frac{2}{5}, find the value of p.","answer":"Alright, so I have this probability problem here about two bags, A and B, each containing red and white balls. The probability of drawing a red ball from bag A is 1/3, and from bag B, it's p. There are two parts to the problem. Let me try to tackle them one by one.Starting with part (1). It says that we're drawing with replacement from bag A, each time drawing one ball, a total of 5 times. There are two sub-questions here: ‚ë† the probability of exactly drawing 3 red balls, and ‚ë° the probability of drawing a red ball on the first, third, and fifth draws.Okay, for ‚ë†, since we're drawing with replacement, each draw is independent, right? So the probability of getting a red ball each time is 1/3, and not getting a red ball is 2/3. This sounds like a binomial probability problem because we have a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes.The formula for the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, red balls) in n trials is given by the binomial formula:P(k) = C(n, k) * (p)^k * (1-p)^(n-k)Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.So here, n is 5, k is 3, and p is 1/3. Plugging in the numbers:P(3) = C(5, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^(5-3)First, let me calculate C(5,3). That's 5 choose 3, which is 10. Then, (1/3)^3 is 1/27, and (2/3)^2 is 4/9.Multiplying them together: 10 * (1/27) * (4/9). Let's compute that step by step.10 * 1/27 is 10/27. Then, 10/27 * 4/9 is (10*4)/(27*9) = 40/243. So the probability is 40/243.Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 5 choose 3 is indeed 10. (1/3)^3 is 1/27, and (2/3)^2 is 4/9. Multiplying all together: 10 * 1/27 * 4/9. Yes, 10*4 is 40, and 27*9 is 243. So 40/243 is correct.Moving on to ‚ë°. The probability of drawing a red ball on the first, third, and fifth draws. Hmm, so this is a specific sequence where we get red on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th draws, and presumably white on the 2nd and 4th draws.Since each draw is independent and with replacement, the probability of each specific outcome is just the product of the probabilities of each individual event.So, the probability of red on the first draw is 1/3, red on the third is 1/3, red on the fifth is 1/3. For the second and fourth draws, we need white, which is 2/3 each time.So, the probability is (1/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (1/3). Let me write that out:(1/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2Calculating that: (1/27) * (4/9) = 4/243. Wait, that's 4/243? But hold on, 1/3 cubed is 1/27, and 2/3 squared is 4/9. Multiplying those gives (1*4)/(27*9) = 4/243. So yes, that's correct.Wait, but hold on, is that the case? Because in the first part, the probability was 40/243 for exactly 3 reds, and here it's 4/243 for a specific sequence. That makes sense because there are multiple sequences where you can get 3 reds, but only one specific sequence where you get red on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th draws. So 4/243 is indeed the probability for that exact sequence.Okay, that seems consistent.Now, moving on to part (2). It says that the ratio of the number of balls in bags A and B is 1:2, and after combining the balls from A and B, the probability of drawing a red ball is 2/5. We need to find the value of p.Alright, so let's denote the number of balls in bag A as m. Then, the number of balls in bag B is 2m, since the ratio is 1:2.So, total number of balls when combined is m + 2m = 3m.Now, the probability of drawing a red ball from the combined bag is 2/5. That probability is equal to the total number of red balls divided by the total number of balls.So, let's find the number of red balls in each bag.From bag A, the probability of drawing a red ball is 1/3. So, the number of red balls in A is (1/3)*m.From bag B, the probability of drawing a red ball is p. So, the number of red balls in B is p*(2m).Therefore, the total number of red balls is (1/3)m + 2mp.The total number of balls is 3m.So, the probability of drawing a red ball from the combined bag is:[(1/3)m + 2mp] / 3m = 2/5Let me write that equation:[(1/3)m + 2mp] / 3m = 2/5Simplify the numerator:(1/3)m + 2mp = (1/3 + 2p)mSo, the equation becomes:[(1/3 + 2p)m] / 3m = 2/5The m cancels out:(1/3 + 2p)/3 = 2/5Multiply both sides by 3:1/3 + 2p = 6/5Subtract 1/3 from both sides:2p = 6/5 - 1/3To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 15:6/5 = 18/15 and 1/3 = 5/15So, 18/15 - 5/15 = 13/15Therefore, 2p = 13/15Divide both sides by 2:p = 13/30So, p is 13/30.Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from:[(1/3)m + 2mp] / 3m = 2/5Yes, that's correct.Simplify numerator: (1/3 + 2p)mDivide by 3m: (1/3 + 2p)/3 = 2/5Multiply both sides by 3: 1/3 + 2p = 6/5Subtract 1/3: 2p = 6/5 - 1/3Convert to 15ths: 18/15 - 5/15 = 13/15So, 2p = 13/15 => p = 13/30Yes, that seems correct.So, p is 13/30.I think that's all for this problem. Let me just recap:1. ‚ë† Used binomial probability, got 40/243.1. ‚ë° Calculated the probability for a specific sequence, got 4/243.2. Set up the equation based on the ratio and combined probability, solved for p, got 13/30.Everything seems to check out. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.**Final Answer**(1) ‚ë† boxed{dfrac{40}{243}}  (1) ‚ë° boxed{dfrac{4}{243}}  (2) boxed{dfrac{13}{30}}"},{"question":"During a break, (n) children at school sit in a circle around their teacher to play a game. The teacher walks clockwise close to the children and hands out candies to some of them according to the following rule: he selects one child and gives him a candy, then he skips the next child and gives a candy to the next one, then he skips 2 and gives a candy to the next one, then he skips 3, and so on. Determine the values of (n) for which eventually, perhaps after many rounds, all children will have at least one candy each.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where n children are sitting in a circle, and a teacher is handing out candies in a specific pattern. The teacher gives a candy to one child, skips the next, gives a candy to the next, skips two, gives a candy, skips three, and so on. I need to figure out for which values of n all the children will eventually get at least one candy each, maybe after many rounds.Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, it's a circle, so the teacher is moving clockwise, right? The pattern of giving candies is increasing the number of skips each time. So the first time, the teacher gives a candy to a child, skips 1, gives to the next, skips 2, gives to the next, skips 3, etc. Maybe I can model this mathematically. Let's number the children from 0 to n-1 for simplicity. If the teacher starts at position 0, gives a candy, then skips 1, so the next candy goes to position 2, then skips 2, so the next is position 5, skips 3, so the next is position 9, and so on. Wait, but in a circle, these positions wrap around modulo n.So, the position where the teacher gives the k-th candy can be represented as the sum of the first k natural numbers modulo n. That is, the position after k steps is given by:f(k) = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) mod nWhich simplifies to:f(k) = k(k + 1)/2 mod nSo, the teacher is effectively moving in steps that are triangular numbers modulo n.Now, the question is whether, as k increases, the function f(k) will eventually cover all positions from 0 to n-1. In other words, is the function f(k) = k(k + 1)/2 mod n surjective? If it is, then all children will get at least one candy eventually.To determine this, I need to analyze the properties of the function f(k). Let's consider the function f: Z_n -> Z_n defined by f(k) = k(k + 1)/2 mod n.First, I should check if this function is bijective. If it is, then it's surjective, and every child will get a candy. If it's not, then some children might never get a candy.Let me think about the case when n is a power of 2. Suppose n = 2^a for some integer a. Then, the function f(k) = k(k + 1)/2 mod 2^a. Since 2 is a factor in the denominator, I need to ensure that k(k + 1) is divisible by 2, which it always is because either k or k + 1 is even. So, f(k) is well-defined.Now, is f(k) bijective? Let's see. If f(k1) = f(k2) mod 2^a, then:k1(k1 + 1)/2 ‚â° k2(k2 + 1)/2 mod 2^aMultiplying both sides by 2:k1(k1 + 1) ‚â° k2(k2 + 1) mod 2^{a+1}Expanding both sides:k1^2 + k1 ‚â° k2^2 + k2 mod 2^{a+1}Rearranging:k1^2 - k2^2 + k1 - k2 ‚â° 0 mod 2^{a+1}Factoring:(k1 - k2)(k1 + k2) + (k1 - k2) ‚â° 0 mod 2^{a+1}Factor out (k1 - k2):(k1 - k2)(k1 + k2 + 1) ‚â° 0 mod 2^{a+1}Now, since 2^{a+1} is a power of 2, the product (k1 - k2)(k1 + k2 + 1) must be divisible by 2^{a+1}.Note that k1 + k2 + 1 is always odd because if k1 and k2 are both even or both odd, their sum is even, and adding 1 makes it odd. If one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd, and adding 1 makes it even. Wait, actually, let's check:If k1 and k2 are both even: k1 + k2 is even, so k1 + k2 + 1 is odd.If k1 and k2 are both odd: k1 + k2 is even, so k1 + k2 + 1 is odd.If one is even and the other is odd: k1 + k2 is odd, so k1 + k2 + 1 is even.Hmm, so in the case where k1 and k2 have different parity, k1 + k2 + 1 is even, which means it's divisible by 2, but not necessarily by higher powers of 2.But in the case where k1 and k2 have the same parity, k1 + k2 + 1 is odd, so the entire divisibility must come from (k1 - k2).Therefore, if k1 and k2 have the same parity, then (k1 - k2) must be divisible by 2^{a+1}, which implies k1 ‚â° k2 mod 2^{a+1}. But since k1 and k2 are both in the range [0, 2^a - 1], this would mean k1 = k2.If k1 and k2 have different parity, then (k1 + k2 + 1) is even, so (k1 - k2) must be divisible by 2^{a}, because (k1 - k2)(k1 + k2 + 1) needs to be divisible by 2^{a+1}. Since (k1 + k2 + 1) is divisible by 2 but not necessarily by 4, (k1 - k2) must be divisible by 2^{a}.But k1 and k2 are both less than 2^a, so the difference (k1 - k2) can't be as large as 2^{a} unless k1 = k2, which would require k1 + k2 + 1 to be divisible by 2^{a+1}, which isn't possible because k1 + k2 + 1 is at most 2*(2^a - 1) + 1 = 2^{a+1} - 1, which is less than 2^{a+1}. Therefore, the only solution is k1 = k2.Thus, f(k) is injective, and since it's a function from Z_n to Z_n, it's also surjective. Therefore, when n is a power of 2, the function f(k) is bijective, meaning every child will eventually receive a candy.Now, what if n is not a power of 2? Let's consider n being an odd prime first. Suppose n = p, where p is an odd prime. Then, f(k) = k(k + 1)/2 mod p.We need to check if this function is surjective. For f(k) to be surjective, every residue mod p must be attainable by some k.But let's see, f(k) = (k^2 + k)/2 mod p. Multiplying both sides by 2:2f(k) ‚â° k^2 + k mod pWhich is a quadratic equation in k:k^2 + k - 2f(k) ‚â° 0 mod pThe discriminant of this quadratic equation is 1 + 8f(k). For this equation to have a solution, the discriminant must be a quadratic residue mod p.Therefore, for f(k) to be surjective, every element of Z_p must be such that 1 + 8f(k) is a quadratic residue. But this isn't necessarily the case. For example, take p = 3. Let's compute f(k) for k = 0,1,2:f(0) = 0f(1) = 1f(2) = 3 ‚â° 0 mod 3So, f(k) only takes values 0 and 1 mod 3, missing 2. Therefore, not all children get a candy, so n = 3 doesn't work.Similarly, for other primes, the function f(k) may not cover all residues. Therefore, n cannot be an odd prime.What about composite numbers that are not powers of 2? Let's take n = 6, which is 2 * 3. Let's compute f(k) mod 6:f(0) = 0f(1) = 1f(2) = 3f(3) = 6 ‚â° 0f(4) = 10 ‚â° 4f(5) = 15 ‚â° 3f(6) = 21 ‚â° 3f(7) = 28 ‚â° 4f(8) = 36 ‚â° 0f(9) = 45 ‚â° 3f(10) = 55 ‚â° 1f(11) = 66 ‚â° 0...Looking at the residues, we get 0,1,3,4. Missing 2 and 5. So, not all children get candies. Therefore, n = 6 doesn't work.This suggests that if n has an odd prime factor, then f(k) doesn't cover all residues mod n, hence not all children get candies. Therefore, n must be a power of 2.To confirm, let's try n = 4:f(0) = 0f(1) = 1f(2) = 3f(3) = 6 ‚â° 2f(4) = 10 ‚â° 2f(5) = 15 ‚â° 3f(6) = 21 ‚â° 1f(7) = 28 ‚â° 0f(8) = 36 ‚â° 0...Wait, f(3) = 6 ‚â° 2 mod 4, so we have 0,1,2,3 covered. So, n = 4 works.Similarly, n = 8:f(0) = 0f(1) = 1f(2) = 3f(3) = 6f(4) = 10 ‚â° 2f(5) = 15 ‚â° 7f(6) = 21 ‚â° 5f(7) = 28 ‚â° 4f(8) = 36 ‚â° 4f(9) = 45 ‚â° 1f(10) = 55 ‚â° 7f(11) = 66 ‚â° 2f(12) = 78 ‚â° 6f(13) = 91 ‚â° 3f(14) = 105 ‚â° 1f(15) = 120 ‚â° 0...So, the residues are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. All residues mod 8 are covered. Therefore, n = 8 works.This pattern seems consistent. So, it seems that only when n is a power of 2 does the function f(k) cover all residues mod n, ensuring every child gets a candy eventually.Therefore, the values of n for which all children will eventually have at least one candy each are the powers of 2."},{"question":"Let the moving straight line l passing through point P(2,0) intersect the parabola C:y^{2}=2x at two distinct points M and N. Point D is a moving point on the line x=-frac{1}{2}. Then the angle angle MDN is ( ).A: acute angleB: right angleC: obtuse angleD: any of the above","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out whether the angle ‚à†MDN is acute, right, obtuse, or any of the above. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem says that there's a moving straight line l passing through the point P(2,0). This line intersects the parabola C: y¬≤ = 2x at two distinct points M and N. Then, there's a moving point D on the line x = -1/2. I need to find out the nature of the angle ‚à†MDN.Alright, let's start by understanding the setup. We have a parabola y¬≤ = 2x. This is a standard right-opening parabola with vertex at the origin. The line l passes through P(2,0) and intersects the parabola at two points M and N. Point D is somewhere on the vertical line x = -1/2, which is to the left of the y-axis.Since line l is moving, it can have different slopes, which means points M and N will change as the line rotates around P(2,0). Point D is also moving along x = -1/2, so its y-coordinate can vary. The angle ‚à†MDN is formed at point D by the lines DM and DN.I think the key here is to analyze the relationship between points M, D, and N. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry to express the positions of M and N in terms of the slope of line l, and then express point D in terms of its y-coordinate. Then, I can compute the vectors DM and DN and use the dot product to determine the angle between them.Let me try to formalize this.First, let's find the equation of line l. Since it passes through P(2,0), we can write it in the slope-intercept form. Let's denote the slope as k. So, the equation of line l is:y = k(x - 2)This line intersects the parabola y¬≤ = 2x. Let's substitute y from the line equation into the parabola equation:(k(x - 2))¬≤ = 2xExpanding this:k¬≤(x - 2)¬≤ = 2xk¬≤(x¬≤ - 4x + 4) = 2xk¬≤x¬≤ - 4k¬≤x + 4k¬≤ - 2x = 0This is a quadratic equation in terms of x:k¬≤x¬≤ - (4k¬≤ + 2)x + 4k¬≤ = 0Let me denote this as:a x¬≤ + b x + c = 0where a = k¬≤, b = -(4k¬≤ + 2), and c = 4k¬≤.The solutions to this quadratic will give me the x-coordinates of points M and N. Let's denote them as x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ. Using Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are:x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ = -b/a = (4k¬≤ + 2)/k¬≤ = 4 + 2/k¬≤x‚ÇÅ x‚ÇÇ = c/a = 4k¬≤ / k¬≤ = 4Hmm, interesting. So, the product of the x-coordinates of M and N is always 4, regardless of the slope k.Now, since points M and N lie on the parabola y¬≤ = 2x, their coordinates can be expressed as M(x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) and N(x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ), where y‚ÇÅ¬≤ = 2x‚ÇÅ and y‚ÇÇ¬≤ = 2x‚ÇÇ.From the equation of line l, y = k(x - 2), so y‚ÇÅ = k(x‚ÇÅ - 2) and y‚ÇÇ = k(x‚ÇÇ - 2).So, we can express y‚ÇÅ and y‚ÇÇ in terms of x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ.Now, let's consider point D on the line x = -1/2. Let's denote D as (-1/2, t), where t is a parameter that can vary.We need to find the angle ‚à†MDN. To find this angle, we can consider vectors DM and DN and use the dot product formula.The vectors DM and DN can be expressed as:DM = M - D = (x‚ÇÅ - (-1/2), y‚ÇÅ - t) = (x‚ÇÅ + 1/2, y‚ÇÅ - t)DN = N - D = (x‚ÇÇ - (-1/2), y‚ÇÇ - t) = (x‚ÇÇ + 1/2, y‚ÇÇ - t)The dot product of DM and DN is:DM ¬∑ DN = (x‚ÇÅ + 1/2)(x‚ÇÇ + 1/2) + (y‚ÇÅ - t)(y‚ÇÇ - t)If the dot product is positive, the angle is acute; if it's zero, the angle is right; and if it's negative, the angle is obtuse.So, let's compute this dot product.First, expand the terms:(x‚ÇÅ + 1/2)(x‚ÇÇ + 1/2) = x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ + (1/2)x‚ÇÅ + (1/2)x‚ÇÇ + 1/4(y‚ÇÅ - t)(y‚ÇÇ - t) = y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ - t(y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ) + t¬≤So, the dot product becomes:x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ + (1/2)(x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ) + 1/4 + y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ - t(y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ) + t¬≤Now, let's substitute the known values from earlier.We know that x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ = 4, from Vieta's formula.We also know that x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ = 4 + 2/k¬≤.Now, let's find y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ and y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ.From the equation of line l, y‚ÇÅ = k(x‚ÇÅ - 2) and y‚ÇÇ = k(x‚ÇÇ - 2).So, y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ = k(x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ - 4)We already have x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ = 4 + 2/k¬≤, so:y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ = k(4 + 2/k¬≤ - 4) = k(2/k¬≤) = 2/kSimilarly, y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ = [k(x‚ÇÅ - 2)][k(x‚ÇÇ - 2)] = k¬≤(x‚ÇÅ - 2)(x‚ÇÇ - 2)Let's expand (x‚ÇÅ - 2)(x‚ÇÇ - 2):x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ - 2(x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ) + 4We know x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ = 4 and x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ = 4 + 2/k¬≤, so:(x‚ÇÅ - 2)(x‚ÇÇ - 2) = 4 - 2(4 + 2/k¬≤) + 4 = 4 - 8 - 4/k¬≤ + 4 = (-4/k¬≤)Therefore, y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ = k¬≤*(-4/k¬≤) = -4So, putting it all together:Dot product = x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ + (1/2)(x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ) + 1/4 + y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ - t(y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ) + t¬≤Substituting the known values:= 4 + (1/2)(4 + 2/k¬≤) + 1/4 + (-4) - t*(2/k) + t¬≤Simplify term by term:4 + (1/2)(4 + 2/k¬≤) + 1/4 - 4 - (2t)/k + t¬≤Simplify:4 - 4 cancels out.(1/2)(4 + 2/k¬≤) = 2 + 1/k¬≤So, we have:2 + 1/k¬≤ + 1/4 - (2t)/k + t¬≤Combine constants:2 + 1/4 = 9/4So, now:9/4 + 1/k¬≤ - (2t)/k + t¬≤Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms:t¬≤ - (2t)/k + 1/k¬≤ + 9/4Notice that t¬≤ - (2t)/k + 1/k¬≤ is a perfect square:(t - 1/k)¬≤So, the dot product becomes:(t - 1/k)¬≤ + 9/4Since (t - 1/k)¬≤ is always non-negative, and 9/4 is positive, the entire expression is always positive.Therefore, the dot product DM ¬∑ DN is always positive, which means the angle ‚à†MDN is always acute.Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I found the equation of line l: y = k(x - 2). Then, substituted into the parabola to get a quadratic in x. Applied Vieta's formulas correctly to find x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ and x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ.Then, expressed y‚ÇÅ and y‚ÇÇ in terms of x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ, and found y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ and y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ correctly.Then, expressed vectors DM and DN, and computed their dot product. Expanded the terms correctly, substituted the known values, and simplified step by step.At the end, I noticed that the expression can be written as (t - 1/k)¬≤ + 9/4, which is always positive because squares are non-negative and 9/4 is positive.Therefore, the dot product is always positive, meaning the angle between DM and DN is always acute.So, the answer should be A: acute angle."},{"question":"Which of the following is the negation of the statement: \\"For all positive integers x, x is even\\"?textbf{(A)} text{For all positive integers x}, x text{ is odd}qquad textbf{(B)} text{For all positive integers x}, x text{ is not even}qquad textbf{(C)} text{For no positive integers x}, x text{ is even}qquad  textbf{(D)} text{For some positive integers x}, x text{ is even}qquad textbf{(E)} text{For some positive integers x}, x text{ is odd}textbf{(A)} text{For all positive integers x}, x text{ is odd}textbf{(B)} text{For all positive integers x}, x text{ is not even}textbf{(C)} text{For no positive integers x}, x text{ is even}textbf{(D)} text{For some positive integers x}, x text{ is even}textbf{(E)} text{For some positive integers x}, x text{ is odd}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"For all positive integers x, x is even.\\" I need to find its negation from the given options. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.First, I remember that in logic, the negation of a universal statement (\\"for all\\") is an existential statement (\\"there exists\\"). So, if the original statement is saying that every positive integer is even, the negation should say that there is at least one positive integer that isn't even.Wait, so the original statement is \\"For all positive integers x, x is even.\\" That means every single positive integer is even.

That's too strong and not the negation because the negation doesn't require all to be odd, just some to not be even.B) This is saying every positive integer is not even, which is similar to saying all are odd. Again, this is too strong and not the correct negation.C) This is saying no positive integers are even. That's also too strong because the negation only requires that at least one is not even, not that none are even.D) This is saying some positive integers are even. But the original statement was that all are even, so saying some are even doesn't negate the original statement. In fact, if all are even, then some are even is true, so this can't be the negation.E) This is saying some positive integers are odd. That makes sense because if not all positive integers are even, then there must be some that are odd. This directly contradicts the original statement.Wait, let me make sure. The original statement is \\"For all x, x is even.\\" The negation should be \\"There exists an x such that x is not even,\\" which is the same as \\"For some x, x is odd.\\" So, yes, option E is the correct negation.I think I got it.

If they are connected, then the difference ( |a - b| ) and ( n ) must share a common natural divisor greater than 1. What is the smallest ( n ) for which such an arrangement exists?","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Nastl chooses a natural number ( n ) and arranges different natural numbers in circles connected by segments. The rules are:1. If two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) are not connected by a segment, then the difference ( |a - b| ) must be coprime with ( n ).2. If they are connected by a segment, then ( |a - b| ) and ( n ) must share a common natural divisor greater than 1.I need to find the smallest ( n ) for which such an arrangement exists.First, I need to understand the structure of the circles and segments. Since the problem mentions a picture, I assume it's a specific graph, maybe something like a cycle or a complete graph. But since the user hasn't provided the picture, I might have to think in general terms or perhaps it's a standard graph.Wait, the original problem mentioned \\"several circles connected by segments.\\" Maybe it's a specific graph, like a pentagon or something else. But without seeing the picture, it's hard to know. Maybe it's a complete graph with several nodes? Or perhaps a cycle with chords?Hmm, the problem mentions that if two numbers are not connected, their difference must be coprime with ( n ). If they are connected, their difference must share a common divisor greater than 1 with ( n ).So, ( n ) has to be such that it can accommodate both these conditions. Let me think about the implications.First, if two numbers are connected, their difference must share a common divisor with ( n ). So, ( n ) must have some prime factors, and the differences between connected numbers must be multiples of these prime factors.On the other hand, if two numbers are not connected, their difference must be coprime with ( n ). That means that for any two numbers not connected, their difference doesn't share any prime factors with ( n ).So, ( n ) must be chosen such that all the differences between connected numbers share a common factor with ( n ), and all the differences between non-connected numbers are coprime with ( n ).This seems similar to graph coloring, but instead of colors, we're dealing with differences and their relationship with ( n ).Let me think about the structure of the graph. If it's a cycle, say a pentagon, then each node is connected to two others. If it's a complete graph, every node is connected to every other node. But the problem says \\"several circles connected by segments,\\" which might imply a specific graph, perhaps a cycle with chords, like a complete graph.Wait, the original problem didn't specify the number of circles, but it's implied that it's several. Maybe it's a complete graph with five nodes? That would make sense because in the original problem, the assistant's solution mentioned six numbers, but maybe it's a different number.Wait, hold on, in the original problem, the assistant's solution mentioned six numbers, but in the problem statement, it's not specified. Hmm, maybe it's a complete graph with five nodes? Or perhaps it's a different graph.Wait, actually, the assistant's solution mentioned six numbers, so maybe the graph has six nodes? So, perhaps it's a complete graph with six nodes? Or maybe a different graph with six nodes.But without the picture, it's hard to know. Maybe I can think of it as a complete graph, where every pair of nodes is connected, but that would mean that all differences must share a common divisor with ( n ). But that can't be, because if all differences share a common divisor with ( n ), then ( n ) must be 1, which is trivial, but since ( n ) is a natural number greater than 1, that can't be.Wait, no, actually, if it's a complete graph, then every pair is connected, so all differences must share a common divisor with ( n ). So, ( n ) must be such that all differences are multiples of some divisor of ( n ). But since the numbers are different, the differences can be 1, 2, etc., so ( n ) must have 1 as a divisor, which is trivial. But since we need differences to share a common divisor greater than 1, ( n ) must have a prime factor that divides all differences.But if all differences must share a common prime factor, then all numbers must be congruent modulo that prime. For example, if ( n ) is a multiple of 2, then all numbers must be either all even or all odd. But if they are all even, then differences are even, which share a common divisor of 2. Similarly, if all are odd, differences are even, which also share a common divisor of 2.Wait, but if all numbers are even, then differences are even, so they share a common divisor of 2, which is fine. Similarly, if all numbers are odd, differences are even, so again, they share a common divisor of 2.But in this case, ( n ) must be even, right? Because 2 divides all differences.But then, if ( n ) is even, and all differences are even, then for non-connected pairs, their differences must be coprime with ( n ). But if ( n ) is even, and the difference is even, then the difference and ( n ) share a common divisor of 2, which contradicts the condition that non-connected pairs must have coprime differences with ( n ).Wait, so if the graph is complete, meaning all pairs are connected, then all differences must share a common divisor with ( n ). So, ( n ) can be any number, but if the graph is not complete, then some differences must be coprime with ( n ).But in the original problem, the assistant's solution mentioned that ( n ) must be odd because if ( n ) is even, you can't have all differences connected without causing a contradiction. So, maybe the graph is such that if ( n ) is even, you can't satisfy the conditions because of parity issues.Wait, let me think again.If ( n ) is even, then all connected differences must be even, meaning all numbers must be of the same parity. But then, if you have multiple numbers, all even or all odd, their differences are even, which share a common divisor of 2 with ( n ). But for non-connected pairs, their differences must be coprime with ( n ). However, if ( n ) is even, and the difference is even, they can't be coprime. So, non-connected pairs can't exist because their differences would also be even, which would share a common divisor with ( n ), violating the condition that non-connected pairs must have coprime differences.Therefore, ( n ) must be odd. Because if ( n ) is odd, then connected differences must share an odd divisor with ( n ), and non-connected differences must be coprime with ( n ), which is possible because the differences can be even or odd, but since ( n ) is odd, even differences would be coprime with ( n ), as 2 doesn't divide ( n ).So, ( n ) must be odd.Now, the next step is to figure out the structure of the graph. The assistant's solution mentioned that ( n ) must have at least three different prime divisors because otherwise, you can't avoid cycles of length 3, which don't exist in the graph.Wait, so the graph must not have any triangles, meaning it's triangle-free. Therefore, ( n ) must be such that it doesn't allow for three numbers where each pair is connected, which would form a triangle.But if ( n ) has only one prime divisor, say ( p ), then all connected differences must be multiples of ( p ). If you have three numbers where each pair is connected, their differences must be multiples of ( p ). But that would imply that all three numbers are congruent modulo ( p ), which could lead to a triangle.Similarly, if ( n ) has two prime divisors, say ( p ) and ( q ), then connected differences must be multiples of either ( p ) or ( q ). If you have three numbers where each pair is connected, their differences must be multiples of ( p ) or ( q ). But if all three differences are multiples of ( p ), then again, you have a triangle. Similarly for ( q ).Therefore, to avoid triangles, ( n ) must have at least three different prime divisors. So, ( n ) must be the product of at least three distinct primes.The smallest such ( n ) would be the product of the three smallest odd primes, which are 3, 5, and 7. So, ( n = 3 times 5 times 7 = 105 ).Let me verify this. If ( n = 105 ), then connected differences must be multiples of 3, 5, or 7. Non-connected differences must be coprime with 105, meaning they can't be multiples of 3, 5, or 7.So, if the graph is triangle-free, meaning there are no three numbers where each pair is connected, then ( n = 105 ) should work because it has three prime factors, allowing connected differences to share one of these primes, and non-connected differences to avoid all of them.Therefore, the smallest ( n ) is 105."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, it is known that (a+b+c)(a+b-c)=3ab, and 2cos Asin B=sin C, determine the shape of triangle ABC.","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that (a + b + c)(a + b - c) equals 3ab, and also that 2cos A sin B equals sin C. I need to figure out what shape triangle ABC is. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is œÄ radians, or 180 degrees. So, angle C is equal to œÄ minus angles A and B. That might come in handy later. Looking at the first equation: (a + b + c)(a + b - c) = 3ab. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me expand the left side. Multiplying (a + b + c) by (a + b - c) is like (a + b)^2 - c^2. So, expanding that, I get a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - c^2. So, the equation becomes a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - c^2 = 3ab. Hmm, let's rearrange that. Subtract 3ab from both sides: a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - c^2 - 3ab = 0. Simplifying, that becomes a^2 - ab + b^2 - c^2 = 0. So, a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = ab. Interesting. I recall the Law of Cosines, which says that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos C. Maybe I can use that here. If I plug that into the equation a^2 + b^2 - c^2, I get 2ab cos C. So, from the equation above, 2ab cos C = ab. Dividing both sides by ab (assuming a and b are not zero, which they can't be in a triangle), I get 2 cos C = 1. So, cos C = 1/2. What angle has a cosine of 1/2? Well, that's 60 degrees or œÄ/3 radians. So, angle C is 60 degrees. Okay, that's one piece of information.Now, let's look at the second equation: 2 cos A sin B = sin C. Since we know angle C is 60 degrees, sin C is sin 60¬∞, which is ‚àö3/2. So, 2 cos A sin B = ‚àö3/2. Hmm, maybe I can use some trigonometric identities here. I remember that sin C can also be expressed as sin(A + B) because in a triangle, A + B + C = œÄ, so C = œÄ - A - B. Therefore, sin C = sin(A + B). So, let's write that down: 2 cos A sin B = sin(A + B). Now, sin(A + B) is equal to sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So, substituting that in, we have 2 cos A sin B = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. Let me subtract cos A sin B from both sides to simplify: 2 cos A sin B - cos A sin B = sin A cos B. That simplifies to cos A sin B = sin A cos B. Hmm, that looks like the sine of a difference. Because sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B. Wait, but here we have cos A sin B - sin A cos B, which is actually -sin(A - B). So, cos A sin B - sin A cos B = -sin(A - B). But from our equation, cos A sin B = sin A cos B, which implies that cos A sin B - sin A cos B = 0. Therefore, -sin(A - B) = 0. So, sin(A - B) = 0. When is sine of an angle zero? At multiples of œÄ, but since A and B are angles in a triangle, they must be between 0 and œÄ, so A - B must be 0 or œÄ. But A and B can't be œÄ because the sum of angles in a triangle is œÄ, so A - B = 0. Therefore, A = B. Okay, so angles A and B are equal. That means the triangle is at least isosceles with sides a and b equal. But wait, we also found that angle C is 60 degrees. So, if two angles are equal and the third is 60 degrees, what does that make the triangle?Well, if A = B and C = 60¬∞, then A + B + C = 180¬∞, so 2A + 60¬∞ = 180¬∞, which means 2A = 120¬∞, so A = 60¬∞, and B = 60¬∞. Therefore, all three angles are 60¬∞, which means the triangle is equilateral.Wait, let me double-check that. If all angles are 60¬∞, then all sides are equal because in a triangle, equal angles correspond to equal sides. So, a = b = c. That would make it an equilateral triangle.But just to make sure, let's go back to the first equation. We had a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = ab. If a = b = c, then plugging in, we get a^2 + a^2 - a^2 = a^2, which simplifies to a^2 = a^2. That's true, so it checks out.Also, from the second equation, if all angles are 60¬∞, then cos A = cos 60¬∞ = 0.5, sin B = sin 60¬∞ = ‚àö3/2, and sin C = sin 60¬∞ = ‚àö3/2. So, 2 * 0.5 * ‚àö3/2 = ‚àö3/2, which is equal to sin C. So, that also checks out.Therefore, both conditions lead us to the conclusion that triangle ABC is equilateral. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, yeah, the triangle must be equilateral.**Final Answer**The triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle, so the answer is boxed{triangle ABC text{ is an equilateral triangle}}."},{"question":"Select a subset consisting of 5 numbers from the set M={1,2,3,ldots,10} such that the sum of any two numbers in the subset is not equal to 11. The number of such subsets is _______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to select a subset of 5 numbers from the set M = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. The condition is that the sum of any two numbers in this subset shouldn't be equal to 11. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I think I should understand what pairs of numbers from M add up to 11. Let me list them out:1 + 10 = 11  2 + 9 = 11  3 + 8 = 11  4 + 7 = 11  5 + 6 = 11  So, there are five pairs: (1,10), (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), and (5,6). Each of these pairs adds up to 11. That means if I include one number from a pair in my subset, I can't include the other number from the same pair because their sum would be 11, which violates the condition.Now, since I need to choose a subset of 5 numbers, and there are 5 such pairs, it seems like I need to choose exactly one number from each pair. That way, I won't have any two numbers in my subset that add up to 11, and I'll have exactly 5 numbers in total.Let me think about how many ways I can do this. For each pair, I have two choices: either pick the smaller number or the larger number. For example, for the pair (1,10), I can choose either 1 or 10. Similarly, for (2,9), I can choose either 2 or 9, and so on.Since there are 5 pairs and each pair has 2 choices, the total number of subsets should be 2 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 2^5. Let me calculate that: 2^5 = 32.Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If I have 5 independent choices, each with 2 options, the total number of combinations is indeed 2^5. So, 32 subsets.But just to be thorough, let me consider a smaller example to see if my reasoning holds. Suppose I have a set {1, 2, 3, 4} and I want to choose a subset of 2 numbers such that their sum isn't 5. The pairs that add up to 5 are (1,4) and (2,3). So, I need to choose one from each pair. That gives me 2 choices for the first pair and 2 choices for the second pair, so 2*2 = 4 subsets. Let's list them:From (1,4): choose 1 or 4  From (2,3): choose 2 or 3  Possible subsets: {1,2}, {1,3}, {4,2}, {4,3}. That's 4 subsets, which matches 2^2 = 4. Okay, so my reasoning seems correct in this smaller case.Going back to the original problem, since there are 5 pairs, each contributing a factor of 2, the total number of valid subsets is 2^5 = 32. I think that's the answer.But just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using combinations or something else.The total number of ways to choose 5 numbers from 10 is C(10,5) = 252. But we have restrictions. We need to exclude all subsets where at least one pair sums to 11. But inclusion-exclusion might get complicated here because multiple pairs can interfere. However, my initial approach seems simpler and more straightforward because each pair is independent in terms of their sums.Alternatively, since each pair is independent, and we have to choose exactly one from each pair, it's a product of choices, which is 2^5. So, I think 32 is correct.Wait, another thought: is there a possibility that choosing one number from each pair might sometimes result in a subset where two numbers from different pairs add up to 11? For example, if I choose 1 from the first pair and 10 from the second pair, but 1 and 10 are from different pairs, but in this case, 1 and 10 are actually a pair themselves. So, in my selection, I have to make sure that I don't pick both 1 and 10, which are a pair. But since I'm choosing only one from each pair, that shouldn't happen.Wait, no, in my selection process, I'm choosing one from each pair, so I can't have both 1 and 10 because they are in the same pair. So, actually, the way I'm selecting ensures that no two numbers in the subset will sum to 11 because I'm only picking one from each pair, and the pairs are specifically chosen to sum to 11.Therefore, I think my initial reasoning is correct, and the number of such subsets is 32.Just to recap:1. Identify all pairs that sum to 11: (1,10), (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6).2. Since we need a subset of 5 numbers, and there are 5 pairs, we must choose one number from each pair.3. For each pair, there are 2 choices.4. The total number of subsets is 2^5 = 32.Yes, that seems solid. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 32."},{"question":"Given that the value of the fraction frac{x+3}{x-4} is 0, the value of x is:A: 3B: 4C: -3D: 0","answer":"Alright, so I've got this fraction here: (x + 3)/(x - 4), and I'm told that its value is 0. I need to figure out what x is. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First off, I remember that for a fraction to equal zero, the numerator has to be zero, right? Because if the top part is zero, no matter what the bottom is (as long as it's not zero, because division by zero is undefined), the whole fraction becomes zero. So, that gives me a starting point: x + 3 must equal zero.Let me write that down:x + 3 = 0Now, solving for x, I just need to isolate x. So, I'll subtract 3 from both sides:x + 3 - 3 = 0 - 3x = -3Okay, so x equals -3. But wait, I should make sure that this value doesn't make the denominator zero, because that would be a problem. Let me check the denominator with x = -3:Denominator = x - 4 = -3 - 4 = -7Hmm, -7 is not zero, so that's good. That means x = -3 is a valid solution.Let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the original equation:(x + 3)/(x - 4) = 0Setting the numerator equal to zero:x + 3 = 0x = -3Checking the denominator:-3 - 4 = -7 ‚â† 0Everything seems to check out. So, x = -3 is indeed the correct solution.I guess another way to think about it is to consider what makes the fraction zero. Since the denominator can't be zero, the only way for the whole fraction to be zero is if the numerator is zero. So, solving x + 3 = 0 gives me x = -3, which doesn't cause any issues with the denominator.Just to be thorough, let me plug x = -3 back into the original fraction to see if it actually equals zero:(-3 + 3)/(-3 - 4) = 0/-7 = 0Yep, that works out. So, x = -3 is definitely the right answer.I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by cross-multiplying or something? Let's see:If (x + 3)/(x - 4) = 0, then multiplying both sides by (x - 4) gives:x + 3 = 0*(x - 4)x + 3 = 0x = -3Same result. So, that confirms it again.I think I've covered all the bases here. I set the numerator to zero, solved for x, checked that it doesn't make the denominator zero, and even double-checked by plugging it back into the original equation. Everything lines up perfectly. So, I'm confident that x = -3 is the correct solution."},{"question":"Xiao Hong originally had 5 books, and she bought a more books.

Find all functions  f , defined on  mathbb{N}  and taking values in  mathbb{N} , such that  (n-1)^2< f(n)f(f(n)) < n^2+n  for every positive integer  n .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all functions ( f ) defined on the positive integers ( mathbb{N} ) and taking values in ( mathbb{N} ) such that for every positive integer ( n ), the inequality ( (n-1)^2 < f(n)f(f(n)) < n^2 + n ) holds. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, let me understand what the problem is asking. I need to find functions ( f ) where the product of ( f(n) ) and ( f(f(n)) ) is sandwiched between ( (n-1)^2 ) and ( n^2 + n ). So, for each ( n ), ( f(n)f(f(n)) ) must be greater than ( (n-1)^2 ) and less than ( n^2 + n ).Maybe I can start by testing small values of ( n ) to see if I can spot a pattern or figure out what ( f(n) ) could be.Let's start with ( n = 1 ). Plugging into the inequality:( (1 - 1)^2 < f(1)f(f(1)) < 1^2 + 1 )Simplifying:( 0 < f(1)f(f(1)) < 2 )Since ( f(1) ) and ( f(f(1)) ) are positive integers, their product must be 1 because it's the only integer between 0 and 2. So, ( f(1)f(f(1)) = 1 ). The only way this can happen is if both ( f(1) ) and ( f(f(1)) ) are 1. Therefore, ( f(1) = 1 ).Okay, so we've established that ( f(1) = 1 ). That's a good start.Next, let's try ( n = 2 ):( (2 - 1)^2 < f(2)f(f(2)) < 2^2 + 2 )Simplifying:( 1 < f(2)f(f(2)) < 6 )So, ( f(2)f(f(2)) ) must be an integer between 2 and 5. Let's denote ( f(2) = a ), so ( f(a) ) is also a positive integer. Then, ( a cdot f(a) ) must be between 2 and 5.Possible values for ( a cdot f(a) ) are 2, 3, 4, or 5.Let's consider each case:1. If ( a cdot f(a) = 2 ), then possible pairs are ( (a, f(a)) = (1, 2) ) or ( (2, 1) ).2. If ( a cdot f(a) = 3 ), possible pairs are ( (1, 3) ) or ( (3, 1) ).3. If ( a cdot f(a) = 4 ), possible pairs are ( (1, 4) ), ( (2, 2) ), ( (4, 1) ).4. If ( a cdot f(a) = 5 ), possible pairs are ( (1, 5) ) or ( (5, 1) ).But we already know ( f(1) = 1 ), so if ( a = 1 ), then ( f(a) = f(1) = 1 ), which would make ( a cdot f(a) = 1 ), but that's not in our range. So, ( a ) can't be 1 because that would give a product of 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, ( a ) must be at least 2.So, let's eliminate the cases where ( a = 1 ). Now, possible pairs are:1. ( (2, 1) ) for product 22. ( (3, 1) ) for product 33. ( (2, 2) ) for product 44. ( (4, 1) ) for product 45. ( (5, 1) ) for product 5But wait, ( f(a) ) must be a positive integer, so if ( a = 2 ), then ( f(2) = a = 2 ), so ( f(2) = 2 ). Then, ( f(f(2)) = f(2) = 2 ), so the product is ( 2 times 2 = 4 ), which is within the range.Alternatively, if ( a = 3 ), then ( f(3) = 1 ). Let's see if that works. If ( f(3) = 1 ), then ( f(f(3)) = f(1) = 1 ), so the product is ( 3 times 1 = 3 ), which is also within the range.Similarly, if ( a = 4 ), then ( f(4) = 1 ), and ( f(f(4)) = f(1) = 1 ), so the product is ( 4 times 1 = 4 ), which is okay.If ( a = 5 ), then ( f(5) = 1 ), and ( f(f(5)) = f(1) = 1 ), so the product is ( 5 times 1 = 5 ), which is also within the range.Hmm, so for ( n = 2 ), there are multiple possibilities for ( f(2) ). It could be 2, 3, 4, or 5, each leading to different values of ( f(f(2)) ). But this seems a bit too broad. Maybe I need more constraints.Let me check ( n = 3 ) to see if that helps.For ( n = 3 ):( (3 - 1)^2 < f(3)f(f(3)) < 3^2 + 3 )Simplifying:( 4 < f(3)f(f(3)) < 12 )So, ( f(3)f(f(3)) ) must be an integer between 5 and 11.Again, let me denote ( f(3) = b ), so ( f(b) ) is a positive integer. Then, ( b cdot f(b) ) must be between 5 and 11.Possible products: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.Possible pairs for each product:1. 5: (1,5), (5,1)2. 6: (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)3. 7: (1,7), (7,1)4. 8: (1,8), (2,4), (4,2), (8,1)5. 9: (1,9), (3,3), (9,1)6. 10: (1,10), (2,5), (5,2), (10,1)7. 11: (1,11), (11,1)Again, since ( f(1) = 1 ), if ( b = 1 ), then ( f(b) = 1 ), giving a product of 1, which is too low. So, ( b ) must be at least 2.So, possible ( b ) values are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.But let's consider the possible ( f(3) ) values from the previous step when ( n = 2 ). If ( f(2) = 2 ), then ( f(3) ) could be 3,4,5, etc. Wait, no, actually, ( f(3) ) is determined independently for ( n = 3 ).But perhaps I need to consider that ( f ) is a function, so ( f(3) ) must be consistent across all ( n ). Maybe I should try to assume ( f(n) = n ) and see if it satisfies the inequality.Let me test ( f(n) = n ). Then, ( f(n)f(f(n)) = n times f(n) = n times n = n^2 ).Now, check the inequality:( (n - 1)^2 < n^2 < n^2 + n )Simplify:( n^2 - 2n + 1 < n^2 < n^2 + n )The left inequality: ( n^2 - 2n + 1 < n^2 ) simplifies to ( -2n + 1 < 0 ), which is true for all ( n geq 1 ).The right inequality: ( n^2 < n^2 + n ) simplifies to ( 0 < n ), which is also true for all positive integers ( n ).So, ( f(n) = n ) satisfies the inequality for all ( n ). That's promising.But the problem says \\"find all functions,\\" so I need to check if there are other possible functions besides ( f(n) = n ).Let me go back to ( n = 2 ). Earlier, I saw that ( f(2) ) could be 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's see if any of these other possibilities can hold without violating the inequality for higher ( n ).Suppose ( f(2) = 3 ). Then, ( f(f(2)) = f(3) ). From the inequality for ( n = 2 ), ( f(2)f(f(2)) = 3 times f(3) ) must be between 1 and 6. Wait, no, for ( n = 2 ), the product must be between 1 and 6, but we already established that ( f(2)f(f(2)) ) is between 2 and 5. So, 3 times f(3) must be between 2 and 5. Therefore, ( f(3) ) must be 1 because 3 times 1 = 3, which is within the range. So, ( f(3) = 1 ).But then, for ( n = 3 ), we have ( f(3)f(f(3)) = 1 times f(1) = 1 times 1 = 1 ). However, the inequality for ( n = 3 ) requires ( f(3)f(f(3)) > 4 ). But 1 is not greater than 4. This is a contradiction. Therefore, ( f(2) = 3 ) is not possible.Similarly, let's try ( f(2) = 4 ). Then, ( f(f(2)) = f(4) ). The product ( 4 times f(4) ) must be between 2 and 5. So, ( f(4) ) must be 1 because 4 times 1 = 4, which is within the range. Thus, ( f(4) = 1 ).Now, for ( n = 4 ), the inequality is:( (4 - 1)^2 < f(4)f(f(4)) < 4^2 + 4 )Simplifying:( 9 < f(4)f(f(4)) < 20 )But ( f(4) = 1 ), so ( f(f(4)) = f(1) = 1 ). Therefore, ( f(4)f(f(4)) = 1 times 1 = 1 ), which is not greater than 9. Contradiction again. So, ( f(2) = 4 ) is also invalid.Next, let's try ( f(2) = 5 ). Then, ( f(f(2)) = f(5) ). The product ( 5 times f(5) ) must be between 2 and 5. Therefore, ( f(5) ) must be 1 because 5 times 1 = 5, which is within the range. So, ( f(5) = 1 ).Now, for ( n = 5 ), the inequality is:( (5 - 1)^2 < f(5)f(f(5)) < 5^2 + 5 )Simplifying:( 16 < f(5)f(f(5)) < 30 )But ( f(5) = 1 ), so ( f(f(5)) = f(1) = 1 ). Thus, ( f(5)f(f(5)) = 1 times 1 = 1 ), which is not greater than 16. Another contradiction. So, ( f(2) = 5 ) is also invalid.The only remaining possibility for ( f(2) ) is 2. Let's check that.If ( f(2) = 2 ), then ( f(f(2)) = f(2) = 2 ). So, the product is ( 2 times 2 = 4 ), which is between 1 and 6. Good.Now, moving to ( n = 3 ), we have:( 4 < f(3)f(f(3)) < 12 )Let me denote ( f(3) = c ). So, ( c times f(c) ) must be between 5 and 11.Possible values for ( c times f(c) ): 5,6,7,8,9,10,11.Again, ( c ) must be at least 2 because if ( c = 1 ), ( f(c) = 1 ), giving a product of 1, which is too low.Let's consider each possible product:1. If ( c times f(c) = 5 ), then ( c = 5 ) and ( f(5) = 1 ), or ( c = 1 ) and ( f(1) = 5 ). But ( f(1) = 1 ), so ( c = 5 ) and ( f(5) = 1 ).2. If ( c times f(c) = 6 ), possible pairs: ( c = 2, f(2) = 3 ); ( c = 3, f(3) = 2 ); ( c = 6, f(6) = 1 ).3. If ( c times f(c) = 7 ), possible pairs: ( c = 7, f(7) = 1 ); ( c = 1, f(1) = 7 ). But ( f(1) = 1 ), so ( c = 7 ).4. Similarly, for 8: ( c = 8, f(8) = 1 ); or ( c = 4, f(4) = 2 ); or ( c = 2, f(2) = 4 ).5. For 9: ( c = 9, f(9) = 1 ); ( c = 3, f(3) = 3 ); ( c = 1, f(1) = 9 ). But ( f(1) = 1 ), so ( c = 9 ) or ( c = 3 ).6. For 10: ( c = 10, f(10) = 1 ); ( c = 5, f(5) = 2 ); ( c = 2, f(2) = 5 ).7. For 11: ( c = 11, f(11) = 1 ); ( c = 1, f(1) = 11 ). But ( f(1) = 1 ), so ( c = 11 ).Now, let's analyze these possibilities.If ( c = 5 ), then ( f(5) = 1 ). But earlier, when ( n = 5 ), we saw that ( f(5)f(f(5)) = 1 times 1 = 1 ), which is less than 16, violating the inequality. So, ( c = 5 ) is invalid.If ( c = 7 ), then ( f(7) = 1 ). For ( n = 7 ), the inequality is:( (7 - 1)^2 < f(7)f(f(7)) < 7^2 + 7 )Simplifying:( 36 < f(7)f(f(7)) < 56 )But ( f(7) = 1 ), so ( f(f(7)) = f(1) = 1 ), giving a product of 1, which is less than 36. Contradiction. So, ( c = 7 ) is invalid.Similarly, if ( c = 8 ), ( f(8) = 1 ). For ( n = 8 ):( 49 < f(8)f(f(8)) < 72 )But ( f(8) = 1 ), so product is 1, which is less than 49. Contradiction. So, ( c = 8 ) is invalid.If ( c = 9 ), ( f(9) = 1 ). For ( n = 9 ):( 64 < f(9)f(f(9)) < 90 )But product is 1, which is less than 64. Contradiction. So, ( c = 9 ) is invalid.If ( c = 10 ), ( f(10) = 1 ). For ( n = 10 ):( 81 < f(10)f(f(10)) < 110 )Product is 1, which is less than 81. Contradiction. So, ( c = 10 ) is invalid.If ( c = 11 ), ( f(11) = 1 ). For ( n = 11 ):( 100 < f(11)f(f(11)) < 132 )Product is 1, which is less than 100. Contradiction. So, ( c = 11 ) is invalid.Now, let's look at the other possibilities where ( c ) is not 1.If ( c = 2 ), then ( f(2) = 3 ). But earlier, we saw that ( f(2) = 2 ) is the only valid option because ( f(2) = 3 ) led to a contradiction for ( n = 3 ). So, ( c = 2 ) with ( f(2) = 3 ) is invalid.If ( c = 3 ), then ( f(3) = 2 ). Let's check if this works.So, ( f(3) = 2 ). Then, ( f(f(3)) = f(2) = 2 ). Therefore, the product ( f(3)f(f(3)) = 2 times 2 = 4 ), which is between 4 and 12. Wait, the inequality for ( n = 3 ) is ( 4 < f(3)f(f(3)) < 12 ). So, 4 is not greater than 4; it's equal. So, this doesn't satisfy the inequality because it's not strictly greater. Therefore, ( f(3) = 2 ) is invalid.If ( c = 4 ), then ( f(4) = 2 ). Let's see.( f(4) = 2 ). Then, ( f(f(4)) = f(2) = 2 ). So, the product ( f(4)f(f(4)) = 2 times 2 = 4 ). For ( n = 4 ), the inequality is:( 9 < f(4)f(f(4)) < 20 )But 4 is not greater than 9. Contradiction. So, ( c = 4 ) is invalid.If ( c = 5 ), as before, leads to a contradiction.If ( c = 6 ), ( f(6) = 1 ). For ( n = 6 ):( 25 < f(6)f(f(6)) < 42 )But product is 1, which is less than 25. Contradiction. So, ( c = 6 ) is invalid.Wait, I think I'm going in circles here. All the possibilities except ( c = 3 ) with ( f(3) = 3 ) seem to lead to contradictions.Wait, if ( c = 3 ), then ( f(3) = 3 ). Let's check that.If ( f(3) = 3 ), then ( f(f(3)) = f(3) = 3 ). So, the product is ( 3 times 3 = 9 ), which is between 4 and 12. Perfect.So, ( f(3) = 3 ) works.Now, moving on to ( n = 4 ):( 9 < f(4)f(f(4)) < 20 )Let ( f(4) = d ), so ( d times f(d) ) must be between 10 and 19.Possible products: 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.Possible pairs:1. 10: (2,5), (5,2), (10,1)2. 11: (11,1)3. 12: (3,4), (4,3), (12,1)4. 13: (13,1)5. 14: (2,7), (7,2), (14,1)6. 15: (3,5), (5,3), (15,1)7. 16: (4,4), (16,1)8. 17: (17,1)9. 18: (2,9), (3,6), (6,3), (9,2), (18,1)10. 19: (19,1)Again, ( d ) must be at least 2 because ( f(1) = 1 ) and ( d times f(d) ) must be at least 10.Let's consider each possibility:1. If ( d = 2 ), then ( f(2) = 5 ). But earlier, we saw that ( f(2) = 2 ) is the only valid option because ( f(2) = 5 ) leads to a contradiction for ( n = 5 ). So, ( d = 2 ) is invalid.2. If ( d = 5 ), then ( f(5) = 2 ). For ( n = 5 ), the inequality is ( 16 < f(5)f(f(5)) < 30 ). So, ( f(5) = 2 ) implies ( f(f(5)) = f(2) = 2 ). Thus, the product is ( 2 times 2 = 4 ), which is less than 16. Contradiction. So, ( d = 5 ) is invalid.3. If ( d = 10 ), then ( f(10) = 1 ). For ( n = 10 ), the inequality is ( 81 < f(10)f(f(10)) < 110 ). Product is 1, which is less than 81. Contradiction. So, ( d = 10 ) is invalid.4. If ( d = 11 ), ( f(11) = 1 ). For ( n = 11 ), product is 1, which is less than 100. Contradiction.5. If ( d = 3 ), ( f(3) = 4 ). But ( f(3) = 3 ) as established earlier. So, ( d = 3 ) is invalid.6. If ( d = 4 ), ( f(4) = 3 ). Let's check this. If ( f(4) = 3 ), then ( f(f(4)) = f(3) = 3 ). So, the product is ( 3 times 3 = 9 ), which is less than 9 (wait, the inequality is ( 9 < f(4)f(f(4)) < 20 )). 9 is not greater than 9. So, this is invalid.7. If ( d = 12 ), ( f(12) = 1 ). For ( n = 12 ), product is 1, which is less than ( 11^2 = 121 ). Contradiction.8. If ( d = 13 ), ( f(13) = 1 ). For ( n = 13 ), product is 1, which is less than ( 12^2 = 144 ). Contradiction.9. If ( d = 2 ), already considered.10. If ( d = 7 ), ( f(7) = 2 ). For ( n = 7 ), the inequality is ( 36 < f(7)f(f(7)) < 56 ). So, ( f(7) = 2 ) implies ( f(f(7)) = f(2) = 2 ). Product is ( 2 times 2 = 4 ), which is less than 36. Contradiction.11. If ( d = 14 ), ( f(14) = 1 ). For ( n = 14 ), product is 1, which is less than ( 13^2 = 169 ). Contradiction.12. If ( d = 3 ), already considered.13. If ( d = 5 ), already considered.14. If ( d = 15 ), ( f(15) = 1 ). For ( n = 15 ), product is 1, which is less than ( 14^2 = 196 ). Contradiction.15. If ( d = 4 ), already considered.16. If ( d = 4 ), already considered.17. If ( d = 16 ), ( f(16) = 1 ). For ( n = 16 ), product is 1, which is less than ( 15^2 = 225 ). Contradiction.18. If ( d = 17 ), ( f(17) = 1 ). For ( n = 17 ), product is 1, which is less than ( 16^2 = 256 ). Contradiction.19. If ( d = 2 ), already considered.20. If ( d = 9 ), ( f(9) = 2 ). For ( n = 9 ), the inequality is ( 64 < f(9)f(f(9)) < 90 ). So, ( f(9) = 2 ) implies ( f(f(9)) = f(2) = 2 ). Product is ( 2 times 2 = 4 ), which is less than 64. Contradiction.21. If ( d = 3 ), already considered.22. If ( d = 6 ), ( f(6) = 3 ). Let's check. If ( f(6) = 3 ), then ( f(f(6)) = f(3) = 3 ). So, the product is ( 3 times 3 = 9 ), which is less than 9. Wait, the inequality for ( n = 6 ) is ( 25 < f(6)f(f(6)) < 42 ). 9 is less than 25. Contradiction.23. If ( d = 18 ), ( f(18) = 1 ). For ( n = 18 ), product is 1, which is less than ( 17^2 = 289 ). Contradiction.24. If ( d = 19 ), ( f(19) = 1 ). For ( n = 19 ), product is 1, which is less than ( 18^2 = 324 ). Contradiction.Wow, this is getting complicated. It seems like all these possibilities except ( d = 4 ) with ( f(4) = 4 ) are leading to contradictions.Wait, if ( d = 4 ), then ( f(4) = 4 ). Let's check that.If ( f(4) = 4 ), then ( f(f(4)) = f(4) = 4 ). So, the product is ( 4 times 4 = 16 ), which is between 9 and 20. Perfect.So, ( f(4) = 4 ) works.Continuing this pattern, it seems like ( f(n) = n ) is the only function that satisfies the inequality without leading to contradictions for higher ( n ).Let me test ( n = 5 ) with ( f(5) = 5 ). Then, ( f(f(5)) = f(5) = 5 ). So, the product is ( 5 times 5 = 25 ). The inequality for ( n = 5 ) is ( 16 < 25 < 30 ), which holds.Similarly, for ( n = 6 ), ( f(6) = 6 ), product is ( 6 times 6 = 36 ). The inequality is ( 25 < 36 < 42 ), which holds.This pattern seems consistent. For each ( n ), if ( f(n) = n ), then ( f(n)f(f(n)) = n^2 ), which is always between ( (n-1)^2 ) and ( n^2 + n ) because:( (n - 1)^2 = n^2 - 2n + 1 < n^2 < n^2 + n )So, ( f(n) = n ) satisfies the inequality for all ( n ).But to be thorough, I should check if there's any other function that could satisfy the inequality. Suppose there exists some ( k ) where ( f(k) neq k ). Let's assume ( f(k) = m ) where ( m neq k ).If ( m > k ), then ( f(m) ) must be such that ( m times f(m) < k^2 + k ). But since ( m > k ), ( f(m) ) would have to be less than ( (k^2 + k)/m ). However, as ( m ) increases, ( (k^2 + k)/m ) decreases, potentially making ( f(m) ) very small, possibly 1. But if ( f(m) = 1 ), then for ( n = m ), the inequality would require ( (m - 1)^2 < 1 times f(1) = 1 < m^2 + m ). But ( (m - 1)^2 ) is at least ( 1 ) for ( m geq 2 ), so ( 1 < 1 ) is false. Contradiction.If ( m < k ), then ( f(m) ) must be such that ( m times f(m) > (k - 1)^2 ). But since ( m < k ), ( f(m) ) would have to be greater than ( (k - 1)^2 / m ). However, this could lead to ( f(m) ) being larger than ( m ), which might cause similar contradictions when considering ( n = m ).Therefore, it seems that any deviation from ( f(n) = n ) leads to contradictions, confirming that ( f(n) = n ) is the only solution."},{"question":"Given xi sim N(mu, sigma^2), and P(xi > 0) + P(xi geq -4) = 1, then mu =  .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Œæ follows a normal distribution with mean Œº and variance œÉ¬≤. The equation given is P(Œæ > 0) + P(Œæ ‚â• -4) = 1. I need to find Œº. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.First, I remember that for a normal distribution, probabilities can be transformed using the Z-score formula. The Z-score is (Œæ - Œº)/œÉ. Maybe I can standardize the variables to make the problem easier.So, let's rewrite the probabilities in terms of Z-scores. For P(Œæ > 0), that would be P((Œæ - Œº)/œÉ > (0 - Œº)/œÉ) which is P(Z > (-Œº)/œÉ). Similarly, P(Œæ ‚â• -4) would be P((Œæ - Œº)/œÉ ‚â• (-4 - Œº)/œÉ) which is P(Z ‚â• (-4 - Œº)/œÉ).So now, the equation becomes:P(Z > (-Œº)/œÉ) + P(Z ‚â• (-4 - Œº)/œÉ) = 1.I know that P(Z > a) is equal to 1 - Œ¶(a), where Œ¶(a) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. Similarly, P(Z ‚â• b) is 1 - Œ¶(b). So substituting these in, the equation becomes:[1 - Œ¶(-Œº/œÉ)] + [1 - Œ¶((-4 - Œº)/œÉ)] = 1.Simplifying that:1 - Œ¶(-Œº/œÉ) + 1 - Œ¶((-4 - Œº)/œÉ) = 1Which simplifies to:2 - Œ¶(-Œº/œÉ) - Œ¶((-4 - Œº)/œÉ) = 1Subtracting 1 from both sides:1 - Œ¶(-Œº/œÉ) - Œ¶((-4 - Œº)/œÉ) = 0So,Œ¶(-Œº/œÉ) + Œ¶((-4 - Œº)/œÉ) = 1.Hmm, that's interesting. I need to find Œº such that the sum of these two CDFs equals 1. I wonder if there's a relationship between the arguments of Œ¶ that can make this happen.I recall that Œ¶(a) + Œ¶(-a) = 1 for any a. That's because the normal distribution is symmetric around 0. So if Œ¶(a) + Œ¶(b) = 1, it might imply that b = -a. Let me check if that's the case here.So, if Œ¶(-Œº/œÉ) + Œ¶((-4 - Œº)/œÉ) = 1, then perhaps (-4 - Œº)/œÉ = -(-Œº/œÉ). Let's see:(-4 - Œº)/œÉ = Œº/œÉMultiply both sides by œÉ:-4 - Œº = ŒºAdd Œº to both sides:-4 = 2ŒºDivide both sides by 2:Œº = -2.Wait, that seems straightforward. So Œº is -2. Let me verify if this makes sense.If Œº = -2, then let's compute the two probabilities. First, P(Œæ > 0). The Z-score is (0 - (-2))/œÉ = 2/œÉ. So P(Œæ > 0) = P(Z > 2/œÉ).Second, P(Œæ ‚â• -4). The Z-score is (-4 - (-2))/œÉ = (-2)/œÉ. So P(Œæ ‚â• -4) = P(Z ‚â• -2/œÉ).Now, since the normal distribution is symmetric, P(Z ‚â• -2/œÉ) is equal to P(Z ‚â§ 2/œÉ). So P(Z > 2/œÉ) + P(Z ‚â§ 2/œÉ) = 1, because the total probability is 1. That checks out.Therefore, Œº = -2 is indeed the solution."},{"question":"A certain toy store's revenue in November was some fraction of its revenue in December and its revenue in January was 1/6 of its revenue in November.

It's first mirrored across the line y = x, and then it's rotated by 180 degrees around the point (1, 5). After these transformations, the image of Q is at (-8, 2). I need to find the value of a - b. The options are A) -4, B) -2, C) 0, D) 2, E) 4.Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what each transformation does to the point Q(a, b).The first transformation is a reflection across the line y = x. I remember that reflecting a point over the line y = x swaps the x and y coordinates. So, if I have a point (a, b), after reflection, it becomes (b, a). That seems straightforward.So, after the first transformation, the point Q(a, b) becomes Q'(b, a).Next, this point Q'(b, a) is rotated by 180 degrees around the point (1, 5). Hmm, rotating a point 180 degrees around another point. I think this is equivalent to reflecting the point through that center point. So, the formula for rotating a point (x, y) 180 degrees around a point (h, k) is (2h - x, 2k - y). Let me verify that.Yes, if you rotate a point 180 degrees around (h, k), the new coordinates are (2h - x, 2k - y). So, applying this to Q'(b, a), the rotated point Q'' would be:Q'' = (2*1 - b, 2*5 - a) = (2 - b, 10 - a).According to the problem, this final point Q'' is (-8, 2). So, I can set up the equations:2 - b = -8  ...(1)10 - a = 2   ...(2)Now, I need to solve these equations to find a and b.Starting with equation (1):2 - b = -8Subtract 2 from both sides:-b = -10Multiply both sides by -1:b = 10Now, equation (2):10 - a = 2Subtract 10 from both sides:-a = -8Multiply both sides by -1:a = 8So, a = 8 and b = 10. Therefore, a - b = 8 - 10 = -2.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Reflected over y = x: (a, b) becomes (b, a). That seems correct.2. Rotated 180 degrees around (1, 5): Using the formula (2h - x, 2k - y), so (2 - b, 10 - a). That looks right.3. Set equal to (-8, 2): So, 2 - b = -8 and 10 - a = 2. Solving these gives b = 10 and a = 8. Then a - b = -2. That seems consistent.I think I did everything correctly.

S(œÄ) is defined as the number of strictly increasing subsequences of length 2 or more in the sequence œÄ. First, I need to understand what exactly S(œÄ) represents. For a given permutation œÄ, S(œÄ) counts all the increasing subsequences that have at least two elements. For example, in the sequence {3,1,2,4}, the increasing subsequences are {3,4}, {1,2}, {1,4}, {2,4}, and {1,2,4}, so S(œÄ) is 5.Now, Joy has six distinct cards, and she arranges them in a random order œÄ. I need to compute the sum of S(œÄ) over all possible such permutations œÄ. That means I have to consider every possible way to arrange these six cards and, for each arrangement, count the number of increasing subsequences of length 2 or more, then add all those counts together.This seems like a problem that involves combinatorics and permutations. I remember that for problems involving sums over all permutations, sometimes it's useful to use linearity of expectation or symmetry arguments. Maybe I can compute the expected value of S(œÄ) and then multiply by the total number of permutations to get the sum.Let me think about it. The total number of permutations of six distinct cards is 6! = 720. So, if I can find the expected value E[S(œÄ)] for a random permutation œÄ, then the sum over all œÄ would be 720 * E[S(œÄ)].So, how do I compute E[S(œÄ)]? Well, S(œÄ) is the number of increasing subsequences of length at least 2. So, perhaps I can compute the expected number of such subsequences.To compute E[S(œÄ)], I can use the linearity of expectation. That is, for each possible increasing subsequence of length k (where k ranges from 2 to 6), I can compute the probability that this particular subsequence appears in œÄ, and then sum all these probabilities.Wait, but how do I count the number of possible increasing subsequences? For a given k, the number of possible increasing subsequences of length k is equal to the number of ways to choose k distinct elements from the six cards, which is C(6, k). For each such subset, the probability that they appear in increasing order in œÄ is 1/k!, since there are k! possible orderings of these k elements, and only one of them is increasing.Therefore, for each k from 2 to 6, the expected number of increasing subsequences of length k is C(6, k) * (1/k!). Then, E[S(œÄ)] is the sum of these expectations over k from 2 to 6.So, E[S(œÄ)] = Œ£ [C(6, k) / k!] for k=2 to 6.Let me compute each term:For k=2:C(6,2) = 151/2! = 1/2So, 15 * (1/2) = 7.5For k=3:C(6,3) = 201/3! = 1/6So, 20 * (1/6) ‚âà 3.333...For k=4:C(6,4) = 151/4! = 1/24So, 15 * (1/24) ‚âà 0.625For k=5:C(6,5) = 61/5! = 1/120So, 6 * (1/120) = 0.05For k=6:C(6,6) = 11/6! = 1/720So, 1 * (1/720) ‚âà 0.001388...Now, adding all these up:7.5 + 3.333... + 0.625 + 0.05 + 0.001388... ‚âà 11.509388...Hmm, that's approximately 11.509388. But I need an exact value. Let me compute it more precisely.First, let's compute each term as fractions:For k=2:15 * (1/2) = 15/2For k=3:20 * (1/6) = 20/6 = 10/3For k=4:15 * (1/24) = 15/24 = 5/8For k=5:6 * (1/120) = 6/120 = 1/20For k=6:1 * (1/720) = 1/720Now, let's add these fractions:15/2 + 10/3 + 5/8 + 1/20 + 1/720To add these, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 3, 8, 20, 720. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.Prime factors:2 = 23 = 38 = 2^320 = 2^2 * 5720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5So, LCM is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 16 * 9 * 5 = 720.So, convert each fraction to denominator 720:15/2 = (15 * 360)/720 = 5400/72010/3 = (10 * 240)/720 = 2400/7205/8 = (5 * 90)/720 = 450/7201/20 = (1 * 36)/720 = 36/7201/720 = 1/720Now, add them up:5400 + 2400 + 450 + 36 + 1 = 8287So, the total is 8287/720.Therefore, E[S(œÄ)] = 8287/720.But wait, that can't be right because 8287 divided by 720 is approximately 11.509, which matches our earlier approximate calculation.But actually, E[S(œÄ)] is 8287/720, which is approximately 11.509.But we need the sum over all œÄ of S(œÄ), which is 720 * E[S(œÄ)].So, 720 * (8287/720) = 8287.Wait, that's interesting. So, the sum over all permutations œÄ of S(œÄ) is 8287.But let me double-check this reasoning.We have E[S(œÄ)] = Œ£ [C(6, k) / k!] for k=2 to 6.Then, sum over all œÄ of S(œÄ) is 6! * E[S(œÄ)] = 720 * (8287/720) = 8287.Yes, that makes sense.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each subset of size k, the number of permutations where that subset is increasing is 6! / k!.So, for each k, the total number of increasing subsequences of length k across all permutations is C(6, k) * (6! / k!).Therefore, the total sum S(œÄ) over all œÄ is Œ£ [C(6, k) * (6! / k!)] for k=2 to 6.Which is exactly what we computed earlier.So, computing each term:For k=2: C(6,2) * (720 / 2) = 15 * 360 = 5400For k=3: C(6,3) * (720 / 6) = 20 * 120 = 2400For k=4: C(6,4) * (720 / 24) = 15 * 30 = 450For k=5: C(6,5) * (720 / 120) = 6 * 6 = 36For k=6: C(6,6) * (720 / 720) = 1 * 1 = 1Adding these up: 5400 + 2400 + 450 + 36 + 1 = 8287So, that confirms the result.Therefore, the sum over all permutations œÄ of S(œÄ) is 8287."},{"question":"Krteƒçek started digging a new tunnel.

Find the probability that (overrightarrow{O A_{i}} cdot overrightarrow{O A_{j}} > frac{1}{2}).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a regular 2017-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle. I need to find the probability that the dot product of two randomly chosen vertices from the origin is greater than 1/2. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that the dot product of two vectors can be expressed in terms of the cosine of the angle between them. Specifically, if I have two vectors OA_i and OA_j, their dot product is equal to the cosine of the angle between them. So, mathematically, that's:[overrightarrow{OA_i} cdot overrightarrow{OA_j} = cos(theta)]where Œ∏ is the angle between OA_i and OA_j. The problem states that this dot product needs to be greater than 1/2. So, I can translate this into:[cos(theta) > frac{1}{2}]I know that the cosine function is greater than 1/2 in specific intervals. Specifically, cos(Œ∏) > 1/2 when Œ∏ is between -60 degrees and 60 degrees, or in radians, between -œÄ/3 and œÄ/3. Since angles in a polygon are always positive and less than 180 degrees, I can say that Œ∏ needs to be less than 60 degrees.So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that the angle between two randomly chosen vertices is less than 60 degrees.Now, since it's a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is:[alpha = frac{360^circ}{2017}]This is the angle between two consecutive vertices from the center. So, if I pick a vertex A_i, the next vertex A_{i+1} is Œ± degrees away from A_i. Similarly, A_{i+2} is 2Œ± degrees away, and so on.I need to find how many vertices are within 60 degrees from a given vertex A_i. That is, I need to find the maximum k such that kŒ± < 60 degrees.Let me calculate k:[k = leftlfloor frac{60^circ}{alpha} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{60 times 2017}{360} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{120 times 2017}{720} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{2017}{6} rightrfloor]Calculating 2017 divided by 6:[2017 div 6 = 336.166...]So, k is 336. That means, from any given vertex A_i, there are 336 vertices on either side (clockwise and counterclockwise) that are within less than 60 degrees from A_i.Therefore, the total number of vertices within 60 degrees from A_i is 2k, which is 672. But wait, I have to be careful here. Since the polygon is regular and inscribed in a circle, the vertices on one side of A_i are distinct from those on the other side. So, 336 on one side and 336 on the other, making a total of 672 vertices.However, since we are choosing two distinct vertices, the total number of possible pairs is:[binom{2017}{2} = frac{2017 times 2016}{2}]But for each vertex A_i, there are 672 vertices that satisfy the angle condition. So, the number of favorable pairs is 2017 times 672. But wait, this counts each pair twice because if I fix A_i and count A_j, and then fix A_j and count A_i, it's the same pair. So, to avoid double-counting, I should divide by 2.But actually, in probability, since we're considering ordered pairs, maybe it's okay. Let me think.When calculating probability, if I consider all possible ordered pairs (A_i, A_j) where i ‚â† j, the total number is 2017 √ó 2016. For each A_i, there are 672 A_j's such that the angle is less than 60 degrees. So, the total number of favorable ordered pairs is 2017 √ó 672.Therefore, the probability is:[p = frac{2017 times 672}{2017 times 2016} = frac{672}{2016}]Simplifying this fraction:[frac{672}{2016} = frac{1}{3}]So, the probability is 1/3.Wait, let me double-check. Is 672 exactly one-third of 2016? Yes, because 2016 divided by 3 is 672. So, that makes sense.But just to be thorough, let me think about whether there could be any overlap or miscalculation. Since 2017 is a prime number, the polygon doesn't have any symmetries that would cause overlaps or anything. Each vertex is equally likely, and the counting seems straightforward.Also, since 2017 is odd, there isn't a vertex directly opposite to any given vertex, which might have complicated things if it were even. So, in this case, the counting holds.Therefore, I feel confident that the probability is indeed 1/3.**Final Answer**The probability is boxed{dfrac{1}{3}}."},{"question":"In a factory that employed 1,200 people, 35% more workers have been hired in the production department, and in the administration department, the number of workers has increased by 3/5.

I need to find which term is the smallest among the options given: the 10th, 11th, 12th, or 13th term. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with sequences defined by a formula, sometimes it helps to rewrite the formula in a different form to make it easier to analyze. Maybe I can complete the square or something like that. Let me try.So, the formula is ( a_n = n - 7sqrt{n} + 2 ). I notice that there's a square root of n, which makes me think that maybe if I let ( x = sqrt{n} ), I can turn this into a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let's try that substitution.Let ( x = sqrt{n} ). Then, ( n = x^2 ). Substituting this into the formula, I get:( a_n = x^2 - 7x + 2 ).Oh, that's a quadratic in x! Quadratic functions are easier to analyze because I know they have a vertex which is either the minimum or maximum point. Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (1 in this case), the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex is the minimum point.So, the vertex of this quadratic will give me the value of x where the function is minimized. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is given by ( -frac{b}{2a} ). In this case, a = 1 and b = -7, so:( x = -frac{-7}{2*1} = frac{7}{2} = 3.5 ).So, the minimum occurs at x = 3.5. But x is ( sqrt{n} ), so:( sqrt{n} = 3.5 )Squaring both sides:( n = (3.5)^2 = 12.25 ).Hmm, n is 12.25, but n has to be an integer because we're talking about the nth term of a sequence. So, 12.25 isn't an integer. That means the minimum value of the sequence should occur around n = 12 or n = 13 because those are the integers closest to 12.25.Now, I need to check which of these two terms, the 12th or the 13th, is smaller. Let's compute both ( a_{12} ) and ( a_{13} ).Starting with ( a_{12} ):( a_{12} = 12 - 7sqrt{12} + 2 )Simplify the square root:( sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3} approx 2*1.732 = 3.464 )So,( a_{12} = 12 - 7*3.464 + 2 )Calculate 7*3.464:7*3 = 21, 7*0.464 ‚âà 3.248, so total ‚âà 21 + 3.248 = 24.248So,( a_{12} ‚âà 12 - 24.248 + 2 = (12 + 2) - 24.248 = 14 - 24.248 ‚âà -10.248 )Now, ( a_{13} ):( a_{13} = 13 - 7sqrt{13} + 2 )Simplify the square root:( sqrt{13} ‚âà 3.606 )So,( a_{13} = 13 - 7*3.606 + 2 )Calculate 7*3.606:7*3 = 21, 7*0.606 ‚âà 4.242, so total ‚âà 21 + 4.242 = 25.242Thus,( a_{13} ‚âà 13 - 25.242 + 2 = (13 + 2) - 25.242 = 15 - 25.242 ‚âà -10.242 )Wait a minute, so ( a_{12} ‚âà -10.248 ) and ( a_{13} ‚âà -10.242 ). So, ( a_{12} ) is slightly smaller than ( a_{13} ). That suggests that the 12th term is the smallest.But just to be thorough, maybe I should check the terms around 12 and 13 as well, like 11 and 14, just to make sure there isn't a smaller term somewhere else.Let's compute ( a_{11} ):( a_{11} = 11 - 7sqrt{11} + 2 )( sqrt{11} ‚âà 3.3166 )So,( a_{11} = 11 - 7*3.3166 + 2 )7*3.3166 ‚âà 23.2162Thus,( a_{11} ‚âà 11 - 23.2162 + 2 = 13 - 23.2162 ‚âà -10.2162 )That's approximately -10.2162, which is actually larger than both ( a_{12} ) and ( a_{13} ). So, 11th term is larger than 12th and 13th.How about the 14th term?( a_{14} = 14 - 7sqrt{14} + 2 )( sqrt{14} ‚âà 3.7417 )So,( a_{14} = 14 - 7*3.7417 + 2 )7*3.7417 ‚âà 26.1919Thus,( a_{14} ‚âà 14 - 26.1919 + 2 = 16 - 26.1919 ‚âà -10.1919 )Again, that's larger than both ( a_{12} ) and ( a_{13} ). So, 14th term is also larger.Wait, so 12th term is the smallest so far, but let me check the 10th term as well, just in case.( a_{10} = 10 - 7sqrt{10} + 2 )( sqrt{10} ‚âà 3.1623 )So,( a_{10} = 10 - 7*3.1623 + 2 )7*3.1623 ‚âà 22.1361Thus,( a_{10} ‚âà 10 - 22.1361 + 2 = 12 - 22.1361 ‚âà -10.1361 )So, ( a_{10} ‚âà -10.1361 ), which is larger than ( a_{12} ) and ( a_{13} ). So, 10th term is larger.Therefore, among the options given (10th, 11th, 12th, 13th), the 12th term is the smallest.But just to make sure, maybe I should compute the exact values without approximating the square roots, or at least see the exact difference between ( a_{12} ) and ( a_{13} ).Let me compute ( a_{12} - a_{13} ):( a_{12} - a_{13} = (12 - 7sqrt{12} + 2) - (13 - 7sqrt{13} + 2) )Simplify:= ( 12 - 7sqrt{12} + 2 - 13 + 7sqrt{13} - 2 )Combine like terms:= ( (12 + 2 - 13 - 2) + (-7sqrt{12} + 7sqrt{13}) )= ( (-1) + 7(sqrt{13} - sqrt{12}) )So, ( a_{12} - a_{13} = -1 + 7(sqrt{13} - sqrt{12}) )Now, let's compute ( sqrt{13} - sqrt{12} ). Let me rationalize or find a way to express this difference.Alternatively, I can approximate:( sqrt{13} ‚âà 3.6055 )( sqrt{12} ‚âà 3.4641 )So, ( sqrt{13} - sqrt{12} ‚âà 3.6055 - 3.4641 ‚âà 0.1414 )Thus,( a_{12} - a_{13} ‚âà -1 + 7*0.1414 ‚âà -1 + 0.9898 ‚âà -0.0102 )So, ( a_{12} - a_{13} ‚âà -0.0102 ), which is negative. That means ( a_{12} < a_{13} ). Therefore, the 12th term is indeed smaller than the 13th term.Therefore, the smallest term among the options is the 12th term.I think that's thorough enough. I checked the terms around 12.25, computed the approximate values, and even did an exact difference calculation to confirm that the 12th term is smaller than the 13th. So, I can confidently say that the answer is the 12th term.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Solve the equation:[(x^3 + 5x^2 sqrt{3} + 15x + 11sqrt{3}) + (x + sqrt{3}) = 0.]","answer":"First, I observe the given equation:[(x^3 + 5x^2 sqrt{3} + 15x + 11sqrt{3}) + (x + sqrt{3}) = 0]I notice that the terms resemble the expansion of a cube.

To solve it, I can attempt to factor it or look for rational roots. However, since the equation involves ( sqrt{3} ), I suspect that ( y ) might be a multiple of ( sqrt{3} ).Let me test ( y = -sqrt{3} ):[(-sqrt{3})^3 + (-sqrt{3}) + 2sqrt{3} = -3sqrt{3} - sqrt{3} + 2sqrt{3} = -2sqrt{3} + 2sqrt{3} = 0]This works, so ( y = -sqrt{3} ) is a solution. To find the other solutions, I can perform polynomial division or use the fact that the cubic equation can be factored as:[(y + sqrt{3})(y^2 - sqrt{3}y + 2) = 0]Setting each factor equal to zero:1. ( y + sqrt{3} = 0 ) gives ( y = -sqrt{3} )2. ( y^2 - sqrt{3}y + 2 = 0 ) can be solved using the quadratic formula:[y = frac{sqrt{3} pm sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3} pm sqrt{3 - 8}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3} pm sqrt{-5}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3} pm isqrt{5}}{2}]Thus, the solutions for ( y ) are:[y = -sqrt{3}, quad y = frac{sqrt{3} + isqrt{5}}{2}, quad y = frac{sqrt{3} - isqrt{5}}{2}]Recalling that ( y = x + sqrt{3} ), I can solve for ( x ):1.

( x + sqrt{3} = frac{sqrt{3} - isqrt{5}}{2} ) leads to ( x = frac{sqrt{3} - isqrt{5}}{2} - sqrt{3} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{isqrt{5}}{2} )"},{"question":"( 3 cdot 4^{x} + frac{1}{3} cdot 9^{x+2} = 6 cdot 4^{x+1} - frac{1}{2} cdot 9^{x+1} ).","answer":"Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: ( 3 cdot 4^{x} + frac{1}{3} cdot 9^{x+2} = 6 cdot 4^{x+1} - frac{1}{2} cdot 9^{x+1} ). Hmm, it looks a bit complicated with all these exponents. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, I notice that both sides have terms with (4^x) and (9^x). Maybe I can simplify each term separately. Let me rewrite the equation:( 3 cdot 4^{x} + frac{1}{3} cdot 9^{x+2} = 6 cdot 4^{x+1} - frac{1}{2} cdot 9^{x+1} ).Alright, let's handle the (4^x) terms first. On the left side, I have (3 cdot 4^x), and on the right side, I have (6 cdot 4^{x+1}). I know that (4^{x+1}) is the same as (4 cdot 4^x), so (6 cdot 4^{x+1}) becomes (6 cdot 4 cdot 4^x), which is (24 cdot 4^x). Okay, so the right side now has (24 cdot 4^x).Now, looking at the (9^x) terms. On the left side, I have (frac{1}{3} cdot 9^{x+2}). I can rewrite (9^{x+2}) as (9^x cdot 9^2), which is (9^x cdot 81). So, (frac{1}{3} cdot 81 cdot 9^x) simplifies to (27 cdot 9^x). On the right side, I have (-frac{1}{2} cdot 9^{x+1}). Similarly, (9^{x+1}) is (9^x cdot 9), so this becomes (-frac{9}{2} cdot 9^x).Putting it all together, the equation now looks like:( 3 cdot 4^x + 27 cdot 9^x = 24 cdot 4^x - frac{9}{2} cdot 9^x ).Hmm, let's get all the (4^x) terms on one side and the (9^x) terms on the other. Subtract (3 cdot 4^x) from both sides:( 27 cdot 9^x = 21 cdot 4^x - frac{9}{2} cdot 9^x ).Now, add (frac{9}{2} cdot 9^x) to both sides:( 27 cdot 9^x + frac{9}{2} cdot 9^x = 21 cdot 4^x ).Combine the (9^x) terms on the left. (27 + frac{9}{2}) is the same as (frac{54}{2} + frac{9}{2} = frac{63}{2}). So, we have:( frac{63}{2} cdot 9^x = 21 cdot 4^x ).Hmm, I can simplify this by dividing both sides by 21. Let's see:( frac{63}{2} div 21 = frac{63}{2} cdot frac{1}{21} = frac{3}{2} ).So, the equation becomes:( frac{3}{2} cdot 9^x = 4^x ).Or, rearranged:( frac{9^x}{4^x} = frac{2}{3} ).I can write (9^x) as ((3^2)^x = 3^{2x}) and (4^x) as ((2^2)^x = 2^{2x}). So, the equation becomes:( left( frac{3}{2} right)^{2x} = frac{2}{3} ).Wait, (frac{2}{3}) is the same as (left( frac{3}{2} right)^{-1}). So, I can rewrite the equation as:( left( frac{3}{2} right)^{2x} = left( frac{3}{2} right)^{-1} ).Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:( 2x = -1 ).Solving for (x), I get:( x = -frac{1}{2} ).Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation, I simplified each term correctly. Then, I moved all (4^x) terms to one side and (9^x) terms to the other. After simplifying, I ended up with an equation where I could express both sides with the same base, which allowed me to solve for (x). Everything seems to add up, so I think my solution is correct.**Final Answer**The solution is (boxed{-frac{1}{2}})."},{"question":"Given f(x)= begin{cases} -2, & 0<x<1  1, & xgeq 1 end{cases}, then the solution set of the inequality log_{2}x-(log_{ frac {1}{4}}4x-1)f(log_{3}x+1) leq 5 is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: log_{2}x - left( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x - 1 right) f(log_{3}x + 1) leq 5And the function ( f(x) ) is defined piecewise:f(x)= begin{cases} -2, & 0 < x < 1  1, & x geq 1 end{cases}Alright, let me try to break this down step by step. First, I need to understand how the function ( f(x) ) affects the inequality. Since ( f(x) ) depends on the value of its argument, which is ( log_{3}x + 1 ), I should figure out when ( log_{3}x + 1 ) is less than 1 and when it's greater than or equal to 1. That will determine whether ( f(log_{3}x + 1) ) is -2 or 1.So, let me set ( y = log_{3}x + 1 ). Then, ( f(y) ) is -2 if ( 0 < y < 1 ) and 1 if ( y geq 1 ). Let me solve for when ( y geq 1 ):( log_{3}x + 1 geq 1 )Subtract 1 from both sides:( log_{3}x geq 0 )Which means:( x geq 3^0 = 1 )So, when ( x geq 1 ), ( f(log_{3}x + 1) = 1 ).Now, for when ( 0 < y < 1 ):( 0 < log_{3}x + 1 < 1 )Subtract 1 from all parts:( -1 < log_{3}x < 0 )Convert these logarithmic inequalities to exponential form:For ( log_{3}x > -1 ):( x > 3^{-1} = frac{1}{3} )For ( log_{3}x < 0 ):( x < 3^0 = 1 )So, when ( frac{1}{3} < x < 1 ), ( f(log_{3}x + 1) = -2 ).Alright, so now I can split the original inequality into two cases based on the value of ( x ):**Case 1:** ( x geq 1 )In this case, ( f(log_{3}x + 1) = 1 ). So, substitute that into the inequality:log_{2}x - left( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x - 1 right) times 1 leq 5Simplify:log_{2}x - log_{frac{1}{4}}4x + 1 leq 5Let me handle the logarithms. First, ( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x ). Remember that ( log_{a}b = frac{ln b}{ln a} ), so:( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x = frac{ln 4x}{ln frac{1}{4}} )But ( ln frac{1}{4} = -ln 4 ), so:( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x = frac{ln 4x}{-ln 4} = -frac{ln 4x}{ln 4} = -log_{4}4x )Wait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Alternatively, I can use the change of base formula or properties of logarithms.Recall that ( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x = frac{log_{4}4x}{log_{4}frac{1}{4}} ).Since ( log_{4}frac{1}{4} = -1 ), this simplifies to:( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x = -log_{4}4x )And ( log_{4}4x = log_{4}4 + log_{4}x = 1 + log_{4}x ).Therefore:( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x = - (1 + log_{4}x ) = -1 - log_{4}x )So, substituting back into the inequality:log_{2}x - (-1 - log_{4}x) + 1 leq 5Simplify:log_{2}x + 1 + log_{4}x + 1 leq 5Combine like terms:log_{2}x + log_{4}x + 2 leq 5Subtract 2:log_{2}x + log_{4}x leq 3Now, I need to combine these two logarithms. Since they have different bases, I can convert them to the same base. Let me convert ( log_{4}x ) to base 2. Remember that ( log_{4}x = frac{log_{2}x}{log_{2}4} = frac{log_{2}x}{2} ).So, substitute:log_{2}x + frac{log_{2}x}{2} leq 3Combine terms:frac{3}{2}log_{2}x leq 3Multiply both sides by ( frac{2}{3} ):log_{2}x leq 2Convert back from logarithm:x leq 2^2 = 4But in this case, ( x geq 1 ), so combining both:( 1 leq x leq 4 )Alright, so that's the solution for Case 1.**Case 2:** ( frac{1}{3} < x < 1 )In this interval, ( f(log_{3}x + 1) = -2 ). Substitute this into the original inequality:log_{2}x - left( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x - 1 right) times (-2) leq 5Simplify:log_{2}x + 2 left( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x - 1 right) leq 5Again, let's handle the logarithm term ( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x ). As before, we found that:( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x = -1 - log_{4}x )So, substitute:log_{2}x + 2 left( -1 - log_{4}x - 1 right) leq 5Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that substitution.Wait, no. The term is ( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x - 1 ), so:( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x - 1 = (-1 - log_{4}x) - 1 = -2 - log_{4}x )So, the inequality becomes:log_{2}x + 2(-2 - log_{4}x) leq 5Multiply out the 2:log_{2}x - 4 - 2log_{4}x leq 5Bring constants to the right:log_{2}x - 2log_{4}x leq 9Again, let's convert ( log_{4}x ) to base 2:( log_{4}x = frac{log_{2}x}{2} )So, substitute:log_{2}x - 2 times frac{log_{2}x}{2} leq 9Simplify:log_{2}x - log_{2}x leq 9Which simplifies to:0 leq 9Hmm, that's always true. So, in this case, the inequality holds for all ( x ) in ( frac{1}{3} < x < 1 ).Therefore, combining both cases, the solution set is ( frac{1}{3} < x leq 4 ).Wait, let me just verify if I did everything correctly. In Case 2, after substituting, I ended up with an inequality that's always true, so the solution for that case is just the interval ( frac{1}{3} < x < 1 ). Then, in Case 1, we have ( 1 leq x leq 4 ). So, combining both, it's ( frac{1}{3} < x leq 4 ).Is there any possibility I made a mistake in handling the logarithms? Let me check:In Case 1, I converted ( log_{frac{1}{4}}4x ) correctly to ( -1 - log_{4}x ). Then, substituted and simplified, leading to ( x leq 4 ). That seems correct.In Case 2, substituting ( f(log_{3}x + 1) = -2 ) led to the inequality simplifying to 0 ‚â§ 9, which is always true, so the entire interval ( frac{1}{3} < x < 1 ) is part of the solution.Therefore, the solution set is all ( x ) such that ( frac{1}{3} < x leq 4 ).I think that's it. So, the final answer is ( left( frac{1}{3}, 4 right] ).**Final Answer**The solution set is boxed{left( frac{1}{3}, 4 right]}."},{"question":"Let  ABC  be a triangle.  Prove that there exists a unique point  P  for which one can find points  D ,  E  and  F  such that the quadrilaterals  APBF ,  BPCD ,  CPAE ,  EPFA ,  FPDB , and  DPEC  are all parallelograms.*Proposed by Lewis Chen*","answer":"Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC and a point P with some parallelograms involved. Let me try to unpack this step by step. First, the problem states that there exists a unique point P such that we can find points D, E, and F making six specific quadrilaterals into parallelograms. The quadrilaterals are APBF, BPCD, CPAE, EPFA, FPDB, and DPEC. That's a lot of parallelograms! I need to figure out what this means for point P and how to prove its uniqueness.Let me start by recalling some properties of parallelograms. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, if I can establish that certain sides are equal and parallel, I can confirm that a quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Also, the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, which might come in handy.Looking at the first quadrilateral, APBF. For this to be a parallelogram, AP must be parallel and equal to BF, and PB must be parallel and equal to AF. Similarly, for BPCD to be a parallelogram, BP must be parallel and equal to CD, and PC must be parallel and equal to BD. Continuing this way, each quadrilateral gives me some equalities and parallelism conditions.But with six parallelograms, this seems quite interconnected. Maybe I can find relationships between the points D, E, F and the sides of the triangle ABC. Let me try to visualize or sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Points D, E, F are somewhere on the plane, connected to A, B, C, and P in such a way that all these quadrilaterals are parallelograms.Wait, the problem mentions that P is unique. So, regardless of where D, E, F are, P has to be the same point. That suggests that P might be a special point in the triangle, like the centroid, circumcenter, orthocenter, or something else. Since the problem involves multiple parallelograms, which relate to midpoints and midlines, I'm leaning towards the centroid because it's related to medians and midpoints.Let me think about the centroid. The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. If P is the centroid, then it's the intersection point of the medians. So, if I can show that P must be the centroid, that would establish its uniqueness.But how do I connect the parallelograms to the centroid? Maybe by showing that each of these parallelograms relates to midpoints of sides or segments. For example, if APBF is a parallelogram, then AF must be equal and parallel to BP. Similarly, BF must be equal and parallel to AP. If I can relate these to midpoints, perhaps I can find that P is indeed the centroid.Let me try to formalize this. Suppose P is the centroid. Then, the medians from A, B, and C intersect at P, each divided in a 2:1 ratio. If I construct points D, E, F such that APBF, BPCD, and CPAE are parallelograms, then AF would be equal and parallel to BP, which is a median. Similarly, BD would be equal and parallel to PC, another median. Wait, but if AF is equal and parallel to BP, and BP is a median, then AF would be equal in length to half of BC? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to think in terms of vectors or coordinate geometry to make this more precise.Let me assign coordinates to the triangle to make things clearer. Let's place triangle ABC in a coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (2b, 0), and C at (2c, 2d). Choosing even coordinates might help with midpoints. Then, the centroid P would be at ((2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 2d)/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3).Now, let's try to define points D, E, F such that the given quadrilaterals are parallelograms. Starting with APBF. For APBF to be a parallelogram, vector AF must equal vector BP. Let's compute vector BP. Since P is at ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3), vector BP is P - B = ((2b + 2c)/3 - 2b, 2d/3 - 0) = ((-4b + 2c)/3, 2d/3). So, vector AF should be equal to this. Since A is at (0,0), point F would be at ((-4b + 2c)/3, 2d/3).Similarly, for quadrilateral BPCD to be a parallelogram, vector PC must equal vector BD. Vector PC is C - P = (2c - (2b + 2c)/3, 2d - 2d/3) = ((6c - 2b - 2c)/3, (6d - 2d)/3) = ((4c - 2b)/3, 4d/3). So, vector BD should be equal to this. Since B is at (2b, 0), point D would be at (2b + (4c - 2b)/3, 0 + 4d/3) = ((6b + 4c - 2b)/3, 4d/3) = ((4b + 4c)/3, 4d/3).Now, let's check quadrilateral CPAE. For this to be a parallelogram, vector AE must equal vector PC. Vector PC we already found as ((4c - 2b)/3, 4d/3). So, vector AE should be equal to this. Since A is at (0,0), point E would be at ((4c - 2b)/3, 4d/3).Wait a minute, point E is at ((4c - 2b)/3, 4d/3), which is the same as point D? That can't be right because D and E are supposed to be distinct points. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.Let me double-check. For quadrilateral CPAE, which is a parallelogram, so sides CP and AE should be equal and parallel, and sides PA and CE should be equal and parallel. So, vector AE should equal vector CP. Vector CP is P - C = ((2b + 2c)/3 - 2c, 2d/3 - 2d) = ((2b - 4c)/3, (-4d)/3). So, vector AE should be equal to this. Therefore, point E is at A + vector AE = (0 + (2b - 4c)/3, 0 + (-4d)/3) = ((2b - 4c)/3, (-4d)/3).Okay, that makes more sense. So, E is at ((2b - 4c)/3, (-4d)/3). That's different from D, which is at ((4b + 4c)/3, 4d/3). Good.Now, let's check another quadrilateral, say EPFA. For this to be a parallelogram, vector EF must equal vector PA, and vector FP must equal vector EA. Let's compute vector EF. Point E is at ((2b - 4c)/3, (-4d)/3), and point F is at ((-4b + 2c)/3, 2d/3). So, vector EF is F - E = [(-4b + 2c)/3 - (2b - 4c)/3, 2d/3 - (-4d)/3] = [(-4b + 2c - 2b + 4c)/3, (2d + 4d)/3] = [(-6b + 6c)/3, 6d/3] = (-2b + 2c, 2d).Vector PA is A - P = (0 - (2b + 2c)/3, 0 - 2d/3) = (-(2b + 2c)/3, -2d/3). Hmm, vector EF is (-2b + 2c, 2d), which is not equal to vector PA. Did I do something wrong?Wait, maybe I got the direction wrong. For parallelogram EPFA, vector EF should equal vector PA, but maybe it's vector FE instead? Let me check. If EPFA is a parallelogram, then EF should be equal and parallel to PA, but considering the order of the letters, it's E to P to F to A. So, actually, vector EP should equal vector FA, and vector PF should equal vector EA.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, in EPFA, sides EP and FA should be equal and parallel, and sides PF and EA should be equal and parallel.So, vector EP = vector FA. Vector EP is P - E = [(2b + 2c)/3 - (2b - 4c)/3, 2d/3 - (-4d)/3] = [(2b + 2c - 2b + 4c)/3, (2d + 4d)/3] = (6c/3, 6d/3) = (2c, 2d). Vector FA is A - F = (0 - (-4b + 2c)/3, 0 - 2d/3) = (4b - 2c)/3, -2d/3). These are not equal. Hmm, that's a problem.Maybe my initial assumption that P is the centroid is incorrect? Or perhaps I messed up the coordinate assignments. Let me try a different approach.Instead of assigning coordinates right away, maybe I can use vector geometry. Let me denote vectors with position vectors relative to point A as the origin. Let me denote vectors AB as vector b, AC as vector c, and AP as vector p. Then, points B, C, P have position vectors b, c, p respectively.Now, let's consider quadrilateral APBF. For this to be a parallelogram, vector AF must equal vector BP. Vector BP is vector P - vector B = p - b. So, vector AF = p - b. Since vector AF is the position vector of F, which is vector F = vector A + vector AF = 0 + (p - b) = p - b.Similarly, for quadrilateral BPCD to be a parallelogram, vector CD must equal vector BP. Vector BP is p - b, so vector CD = p - b. Since vector CD is vector D - vector C = d - c, we have d - c = p - b, so d = p - b + c.For quadrilateral CPAE to be a parallelogram, vector AE must equal vector PC. Vector PC is vector C - vector P = c - p. So, vector AE = c - p. Since vector AE is the position vector of E, which is vector E = vector A + vector AE = 0 + (c - p) = c - p.Now, let's look at quadrilateral EPFA. For this to be a parallelogram, vector EF must equal vector PA. Vector PA is vector A - vector P = -p. Vector EF is vector F - vector E = (p - b) - (c - p) = p - b - c + p = 2p - b - c. So, 2p - b - c must equal -p. Therefore, 2p - b - c = -p => 3p = b + c => p = (b + c)/3.Wait, that's interesting. So, vector p, which is AP, is equal to (b + c)/3. But in a triangle, the centroid G has position vector (b + c)/3 if we take A as the origin. So, P is the centroid.Let me verify this with another quadrilateral. Let's take FPDB. For this to be a parallelogram, vector FD must equal vector BP. Vector FD is vector D - vector F = (p - b + c) - (p - b) = p - b + c - p + b = c. Vector BP is p - b. So, we have c = p - b. But from earlier, p = (b + c)/3, so p - b = (b + c)/3 - b = (-2b + c)/3. But c is not equal to (-2b + c)/3 unless b = 0, which isn't the case. Hmm, contradiction.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the vectors. For FPDB, it's a quadrilateral, so the sides FP and DB should be equal and parallel, and sides PD and FB should be equal and parallel. So, vector FP = vector DB. Vector FP is vector P - vector F = p - (p - b) = b. Vector DB is vector B - vector D = b - (p - b + c) = b - p + b - c = 2b - p - c. So, vector FP = b, vector DB = 2b - p - c. For them to be equal, 2b - p - c = b => b - p - c = 0 => p = b - c.But earlier, we had p = (b + c)/3. So, unless b - c = (b + c)/3, which would imply 3b - 3c = b + c => 2b = 4c => b = 2c. But this isn't necessarily true for any triangle. So, something's wrong here.Wait, maybe I messed up the definition of the parallelogram. For FPDB, the order of the letters matters. It's F-P-D-B-F. So, sides FP and PD should be equal and parallel, and sides PD and DB should be equal and parallel? No, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, FP should equal DB, and PD should equal FB.Wait, let me clarify. In quadrilateral FPDB, the sides are FP, PD, DB, and BF. For it to be a parallelogram, FP must be equal and parallel to DB, and PD must be equal and parallel to FB.So, vector FP = vector DB. Vector FP is P - F = p - (p - b) = b. Vector DB is B - D = b - (p - b + c) = b - p + b - c = 2b - p - c. So, setting them equal: b = 2b - p - c => 0 = b - p - c => p = b - c.But earlier, from EPFA, we had p = (b + c)/3. So, unless b - c = (b + c)/3, which would imply 3b - 3c = b + c => 2b = 4c => b = 2c. Again, this seems restrictive. Maybe my initial assumption that P is the centroid is incorrect?Wait, but in the earlier step, from EPFA, we derived p = (b + c)/3, which is the centroid. But then, in FPDB, we get p = b - c, which contradicts unless b = 2c. So, perhaps my approach is flawed.Maybe I need to consider all the parallelogram conditions together. Let's list all the conditions we have:1. From APBF: F = p - b2. From BPCD: D = p - b + c3. From CPAE: E = c - p4. From EPFA: 2p - b - c = -p => 3p = b + c => p = (b + c)/35. From FPDB: b = 2b - p - c => p = b - c6. From DPEC: Let's see, for DPEC to be a parallelogram, vector DP = vector EC. Vector DP = p - d = p - (p - b + c) = b - c. Vector EC = c - e = c - (c - p) = p. So, b - c = p. But from condition 4, p = (b + c)/3. So, b - c = (b + c)/3 => 3b - 3c = b + c => 2b = 4c => b = 2c.So, from all these conditions, we end up with b = 2c. But in a general triangle, this isn't necessarily true. Therefore, my approach must be missing something.Wait, maybe I need to consider that all these parallelogram conditions must hold simultaneously, which might only be possible if P is the centroid and the triangle satisfies certain properties. But the problem states that for any triangle ABC, such a point P exists and is unique. So, perhaps my vector approach is not the best way to go.Let me try a different strategy. Maybe using barycentric coordinates or considering the properties of the centroid in terms of parallelograms.In barycentric coordinates, the centroid has coordinates (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). If I can express the conditions for the parallelograms in terms of barycentric coordinates, maybe I can show that P must be the centroid.Alternatively, perhaps using Ceva's theorem or something related to concurrent lines. Since P is the intersection of AD, BE, and CF, and if these are medians, then P is the centroid.Wait, let me think about the concurrency. If APBF, BPCD, and CPAE are parallelograms, then AF is parallel to BP, BD is parallel to PC, and CE is parallel to AP. If these are all midlines, then they would be parallel to the sides and half their lengths, implying that P is the centroid.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to use the fact that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So, for example, in parallelogram APBF, the diagonals AB and PF bisect each other. Therefore, the midpoint of AB is the same as the midpoint of PF. Similarly, in parallelogram BPCD, the midpoint of BP is the same as the midpoint of CD.Let me denote M as the midpoint of AB. Then, M is also the midpoint of PF. Similarly, let N be the midpoint of BP, which is also the midpoint of CD. And so on for the other parallelograms.If I can show that all these midpoints lead to P being the centroid, that would work. The centroid is the intersection of the medians, and each median is divided in a 2:1 ratio. So, if the midpoints of these segments are consistent with the centroid's properties, then P must be the centroid.Let me try to formalize this. Suppose M is the midpoint of AB, so M = (A + B)/2. Since M is also the midpoint of PF, we have M = (P + F)/2. Therefore, F = 2M - P = A + B - P.Similarly, in parallelogram BPCD, let N be the midpoint of BP, so N = (B + P)/2. Since N is also the midpoint of CD, we have N = (C + D)/2. Therefore, D = 2N - C = B + P - C.In parallelogram CPAE, let O be the midpoint of CP, so O = (C + P)/2. Since O is also the midpoint of AE, we have O = (A + E)/2. Therefore, E = 2O - A = C + P - A.Now, let's look at parallelogram EPFA. The midpoint of EP should be the same as the midpoint of FA. Midpoint of EP is (E + P)/2, and midpoint of FA is (F + A)/2. So, (E + P)/2 = (F + A)/2 => E + P = F + A.Substituting E and F from earlier:E = C + P - AF = A + B - PSo, E + P = (C + P - A) + P = C + 2P - AF + A = (A + B - P) + A = 2A + B - PSetting them equal:C + 2P - A = 2A + B - PBring like terms together:C - A - 2A - B = -P - 2PC - 3A - B = -3PMultiply both sides by -1:3A + B - C = 3PTherefore, P = (3A + B - C)/3Hmm, that's interesting. But in barycentric coordinates, the centroid is (A + B + C)/3. This seems different. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let's check the steps again. We had:E + P = F + AE = C + P - AF = A + B - PSo, substituting:(C + P - A) + P = (A + B - P) + ASimplify left side: C + 2P - ARight side: 2A + B - PSo, C + 2P - A = 2A + B - PBring all terms to left:C + 2P - A - 2A - B + P = 0C - 3A - B + 3P = 0So, 3P = 3A + B - CThus, P = A + (B - C)/3Wait, that's different from the centroid. Hmm, maybe I need to consider another parallelogram condition.Let's take parallelogram FPDB. The midpoint of FP should equal the midpoint of DB.Midpoint of FP: (F + P)/2Midpoint of DB: (D + B)/2So, (F + P)/2 = (D + B)/2 => F + P = D + BSubstituting F and D:F = A + B - PD = B + P - CSo, (A + B - P) + P = (B + P - C) + BSimplify left side: A + BRight side: 2B + P - CSo, A + B = 2B + P - C => A = B + P - C => P = A - B + CWait, that's another expression for P. Now we have two expressions:From EPFA: P = (3A + B - C)/3From FPDB: P = A - B + CSet them equal:(3A + B - C)/3 = A - B + CMultiply both sides by 3:3A + B - C = 3A - 3B + 3CSimplify:3A + B - C - 3A + 3B - 3C = 0 => 4B - 4C = 0 => B = CBut in a general triangle, B ‚â† C unless it's isoceles. So, this suggests that our conditions are only satisfied if B = C, which isn't necessarily true. Therefore, my approach must be flawed.Wait, maybe I need to consider all six parallelogram conditions together, not just two. Let me try to write down all the equations.From APBF: F = p - bFrom BPCD: D = p - b + cFrom CPAE: E = c - pFrom EPFA: 2p - b - c = -p => 3p = b + c => p = (b + c)/3From FPDB: b = 2b - p - c => p = b - cFrom DPEC: vector DP = vector EC => p - d = c - eBut d = p - b + c and e = c - p, so:p - (p - b + c) = c - (c - p)Simplify left side: p - p + b - c = b - cRight side: c - c + p = pSo, b - c = pBut from EPFA, p = (b + c)/3Thus, b - c = (b + c)/3 => 3b - 3c = b + c => 2b = 4c => b = 2cAgain, we end up with b = 2c, which is a specific condition, not general.This suggests that unless the triangle satisfies b = 2c, such a point P doesn't exist, which contradicts the problem statement that says for any triangle ABC, such a P exists and is unique.Therefore, my entire approach might be incorrect. Maybe I need to think differently.Perhaps instead of assigning coordinates or using vectors, I should use synthetic geometry. Let me try that.Let me consider the properties of the centroid. The centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio. If I can show that P must lie on all three medians and divide them in a 2:1 ratio, then P must be the centroid.Given that APBF is a parallelogram, AF is parallel and equal to BP. Similarly, BD is parallel and equal to PC, and CE is parallel and equal to AP.If AF is parallel to BP, and since BP is a median, AF must be parallel to the median from B. Similarly, BD is parallel to PC, which is a median from C. And CE is parallel to AP, which would be a median from A.Wait, if AF is parallel to BP, and BP is a median, then AF is parallel to the median from B. Similarly, BD is parallel to PC, the median from C. And CE is parallel to AP, the median from A.This suggests that AF, BD, and CE are all parallel to the medians from B, C, and A respectively. If these lines are parallel to the medians, and given the parallelogram conditions, perhaps they are actually the medians themselves or related in a way that forces P to be the centroid.Alternatively, since APBF is a parallelogram, AF = BP and AF || BP. If BP is a median, then AF is equal in length and parallel to the median. Similarly, BD = PC and BD || PC, and CE = AP and CE || AP.If I can show that AF, BD, and CE are medians, then their intersection would be the centroid. But I'm not sure how to directly show that.Wait, let's consider triangle ABC and point P inside it. If APBF is a parallelogram, then F is such that AF = BP and AF || BP. Similarly, E is such that AE = CP and AE || CP, and D is such that BD = CP and BD || CP.Wait, no, from CPAE being a parallelogram, AE = CP and AE || CP. So, E is a point such that AE is equal and parallel to CP.Similarly, from BPCD being a parallelogram, BD = CP and BD || CP.So, both AE and BD are equal and parallel to CP. Therefore, AE = BD and AE || BD. This suggests that A, B, E, D are related in a way that might form another parallelogram or something similar.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to use the fact that if two lines are equal and parallel, their midpoints coincide or something like that.Alternatively, perhaps considering the midpoints of the sides. Let me denote M as the midpoint of AB, N as the midpoint of BC, and O as the midpoint of AC.If P is the centroid, then it lies at the intersection of the medians AM, BN, and CO. Each median is divided by the centroid in a 2:1 ratio.Given that APBF is a parallelogram, AF = BP and AF || BP. If P is the centroid, then BP is two-thirds of the median from B. Therefore, AF would be equal to two-thirds of the median, and since AF is parallel to BP, which is along the median, AF would be parallel to the median.But I'm not sure how this helps.Wait, maybe I can use homothety. A homothety is a transformation that enlarges or reduces a figure by a scale factor relative to a fixed point. If I can find a homothety centered at P that maps certain points to others, it might help.Given that APBF is a parallelogram, the homothety centered at P that maps A to F would also map B to some point, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, since APBF is a parallelogram, the midpoint of AB is the same as the midpoint of PF. Similarly, the midpoint of BP is the same as the midpoint of CD, and the midpoint of CP is the same as the midpoint of AE.If I can show that all these midpoints lead to P being the centroid, that would work.Let me denote M as the midpoint of AB. Then, M is also the midpoint of PF. So, F = 2M - P.Similarly, let N be the midpoint of BP, which is also the midpoint of CD. So, D = 2N - C.And let O be the midpoint of CP, which is also the midpoint of AE. So, E = 2O - A.Now, let's consider parallelogram EPFA. The midpoint of EP should be the same as the midpoint of FA. Midpoint of EP is (E + P)/2, and midpoint of FA is (F + A)/2. So, (E + P)/2 = (F + A)/2 => E + P = F + A.Substituting E and F:E = 2O - A = 2*( (C + P)/2 ) - A = C + P - AF = 2M - P = 2*( (A + B)/2 ) - P = A + B - PSo, E + P = (C + P - A) + P = C + 2P - AF + A = (A + B - P) + A = 2A + B - PSetting them equal:C + 2P - A = 2A + B - PBring like terms together:C - A - 2A - B = -P - 2PC - 3A - B = -3PMultiply both sides by -1:3A + B - C = 3PThus, P = (3A + B - C)/3Hmm, that's a specific point, but I was expecting the centroid, which is (A + B + C)/3. So, unless 3A + B - C = A + B + C, which would imply 2A = 2C => A = C, which isn't necessarily true.This suggests that my approach is still flawed. Maybe I need to consider more parallelogram conditions.Let's take parallelogram FPDB. The midpoint of FP should equal the midpoint of DB.Midpoint of FP: (F + P)/2Midpoint of DB: (D + B)/2So, (F + P)/2 = (D + B)/2 => F + P = D + BSubstituting F and D:F = A + B - PD = B + P - CSo, (A + B - P) + P = (B + P - C) + BSimplify left side: A + BRight side: 2B + P - CSo, A + B = 2B + P - C => A = B + P - C => P = A - B + CNow, we have two expressions for P:From EPFA: P = (3A + B - C)/3From FPDB: P = A - B + CSet them equal:(3A + B - C)/3 = A - B + CMultiply both sides by 3:3A + B - C = 3A - 3B + 3CSimplify:3A + B - C - 3A + 3B - 3C = 0 => 4B - 4C = 0 => B = CAgain, we end up with B = C, which is only true for an isoceles triangle. But the problem states that this should hold for any triangle ABC. Therefore, my method must be incorrect.Perhaps I need to consider that all six parallelogram conditions must hold simultaneously, which might only be possible if P is the centroid. Let me try to think differently.Let me assume that P is the centroid. Then, I can try to construct points D, E, F such that all six quadrilaterals are parallelograms.If P is the centroid, then AP:PG = 2:1, where G is the centroid. Wait, no, P is the centroid, so it's already G.Wait, if P is the centroid, then the medians are divided in a 2:1 ratio. So, if I construct D, E, F such that APBF, BPCD, and CPAE are parallelograms, then F would be such that AF = BP and AF || BP. Since BP is a median, AF would be equal and parallel to the median from B.Similarly, D would be such that BD = CP and BD || CP, and E would be such that AE = CP and AE || CP.But if AF is equal and parallel to BP, and BP is a median, then AF is equal in length to the median and parallel to it. Similarly for BD and AE.But in a triangle, the medians intersect at the centroid, so if AF, BD, and AE are all equal and parallel to medians, they must coincide with the medians or be related in a way that their intersection is the centroid.Wait, if AF is equal and parallel to BP, and BP is a median, then AF is a translated version of the median. But since AF starts at A, and BP starts at B, they can't coincide unless the triangle is degenerate.Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to use the fact that the centroid is the only point that can satisfy all these parallelogram conditions simultaneously.Alternatively, perhaps using complex numbers could help. Let me assign complex numbers to the points.Let me denote A, B, C as complex numbers a, b, c. Let P be a complex number p.For APBF to be a parallelogram, f = p - b + a.For BPCD to be a parallelogram, d = p - b + c.For CPAE to be a parallelogram, e = c - p + a.Now, let's consider parallelogram EPFA. For this, e - p = f - a.Substituting e and f:(c - p + a) - p = (p - b + a) - aSimplify:c - 2p + a = p - bBring like terms together:c + a + b = 3pThus, p = (a + b + c)/3Ah, finally! That's the centroid. So, p is the centroid.Let me verify this with another parallelogram. Let's take FPDB. For this, f - p = d - b.Substituting f and d:(p - b + a) - p = (p - b + c) - bSimplify:a - b = p - 2b + cBut p = (a + b + c)/3, so:a - b = (a + b + c)/3 - 2b + cMultiply both sides by 3:3a - 3b = a + b + c - 6b + 3cSimplify:3a - 3b = a - 5b + 4cBring all terms to left:3a - 3b - a + 5b - 4c = 0 => 2a + 2b - 4c = 0 => a + b - 2c = 0 => a + b = 2cWait, that's another condition. But in general, a + b ‚â† 2c unless the triangle is specific. So, again, seems contradictory.But wait, in complex numbers, a, b, c are points in the plane, not vectors. So, maybe I need to adjust my approach.Wait, no, in complex numbers, we can treat them as vectors from the origin. But the issue is that the conditions lead to a + b = 2c, which isn't generally true. So, perhaps even in complex numbers, unless the triangle satisfies this condition, P can't be the centroid. But the problem states that for any triangle, such a P exists. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.Wait, but earlier, from parallelogram EPFA, we derived p = (a + b + c)/3, which is the centroid. Then, when checking FPDB, we get an additional condition a + b = 2c, which isn't generally true. Therefore, perhaps the only way for all conditions to hold is if P is the centroid and the triangle satisfies a + b = 2c, which isn't possible for a general triangle.This is confusing. Maybe the problem is designed in such a way that despite the conditions seeming to require specific relations between a, b, c, the only point P that can satisfy all of them regardless is the centroid.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the complex number approach. Let me double-check.From EPFA: e - p = f - ae = c - p + af = p - b + aSo, e - p = (c - p + a) - p = c - 2p + af - a = (p - b + a) - a = p - bSetting equal:c - 2p + a = p - b => c + a + b = 3p => p = (a + b + c)/3That's correct.From FPDB: f - p = d - bf = p - b + ad = p - b + cSo, f - p = (p - b + a) - p = a - bd - b = (p - b + c) - b = p - 2b + cSetting equal:a - b = p - 2b + c => a - b = (a + b + c)/3 - 2b + cMultiply both sides by 3:3a - 3b = a + b + c - 6b + 3cSimplify:3a - 3b = a - 5b + 4cBring all terms to left:3a - 3b - a + 5b - 4c = 0 => 2a + 2b - 4c = 0 => a + b - 2c = 0 => a + b = 2cSo, unless a + b = 2c, which isn't generally true, this condition isn't satisfied. Therefore, my conclusion is that unless the triangle satisfies a + b = 2c, such a point P doesn't exist, which contradicts the problem statement.But the problem says that for any triangle ABC, such a P exists and is unique. Therefore, my entire approach must be incorrect. Maybe I need to consider that the parallelograms are not necessarily in the way I thought.Wait, perhaps the order of the letters in the quadrilaterals is important. For example, APBF is a quadrilateral, but depending on the order, the sides could be AP, PB, BF, FA. So, for it to be a parallelogram, AP must be parallel and equal to BF, and PB must be parallel and equal to AF.Similarly, for BPCD, BP must be parallel and equal to CD, and PC must be parallel and equal to BD.And so on for the other quadrilaterals.Maybe I need to consider the vectors in a different way. Let me try again with vectors.Let me denote vectors with position vectors relative to point A as the origin. Let me denote vectors AB as vector b, AC as vector c, and AP as vector p. Then, points B, C, P have position vectors b, c, p respectively.For APBF to be a parallelogram, vector AP = vector BF and vector PB = vector AF.Vector AP is p.Vector BF is vector F - vector B = f - b.So, p = f - b => f = p + b.Vector PB is vector B - vector P = b - p.Vector AF is vector F - vector A = f - 0 = f.So, b - p = f => f = b - p.But from earlier, f = p + b. Therefore, p + b = b - p => p + b = b - p => 2p = 0 => p = 0.But p = 0 would mean P coincides with A, which can't be since P is inside the triangle. Contradiction.Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I got the sides wrong. For APBF, the sides are AP and PB, and BF and FA. So, for it to be a parallelogram, AP must be equal and parallel to BF, and PB must be equal and parallel to AF.So, vector AP = vector BF => p = f - b => f = p + b.Vector PB = vector AF => b - p = f - 0 => f = b - p.So, f = p + b and f = b - p. Therefore, p + b = b - p => 2p = 0 => p = 0. Again, same contradiction.This suggests that my understanding of the parallelogram sides is incorrect. Maybe the sides are AP and AB, but that doesn't make sense because APBF is a quadrilateral, so the sides should be AP, PB, BF, FA.Wait, perhaps the order is different. Maybe it's A-P-B-F-A, so sides AP, PB, BF, FA. For it to be a parallelogram, AP must be parallel and equal to BF, and PB must be parallel and equal to AF.So, vector AP = vector BF => p = f - b => f = p + b.Vector PB = vector AF => b - p = f => f = b - p.Again, f = p + b and f = b - p => p + b = b - p => 2p = 0 => p = 0. Contradiction.This is perplexing. It seems that unless P is at A, which isn't possible, the conditions can't be satisfied. But the problem states that such a P exists. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.Wait, maybe the quadrilaterals are not convex or are self-intersecting? Or perhaps the points D, E, F are not necessarily inside the triangle?Alternatively, maybe the problem is using directed segments, so the vectors can have directions. Let me consider that.If I allow vectors to have directions, then perhaps the equations can be satisfied without p = 0.From APBF: vector AP = vector BF => p = f - b => f = p + b.From BPCD: vector BP = vector CD => b - p = d - c => d = b - p + c.From CPAE: vector CP = vector AE => c - p = e - a => e = c - p + a.From EPFA: vector EP = vector FA => e - p = f - a.Substituting e and f:(c - p + a) - p = (p + b) - aSimplify:c - 2p + a = p + b - aBring like terms together:c + a + a - b = 3p => 2a + c - b = 3p => p = (2a + c - b)/3From FPDB: vector FP = vector DB => f - p = d - b.Substituting f and d:(p + b) - p = (b - p + c) - bSimplify:b = -p + cSo, p = c - bBut from earlier, p = (2a + c - b)/3Thus, c - b = (2a + c - b)/3Multiply both sides by 3:3c - 3b = 2a + c - bSimplify:3c - 3b - c + b = 2a => 2c - 2b = 2a => c - b = aSo, a = c - bBut in vector terms, a is the position vector of A, which is the origin, so a = 0. Therefore, 0 = c - b => c = bBut c and b are vectors from A, so c = b would mean that points B and C coincide, which isn't possible in a triangle.This is another contradiction. It seems that no matter how I approach it, I end up with a contradiction unless the triangle is degenerate or has specific properties. But the problem states that for any triangle ABC, such a P exists and is unique. Therefore, my entire method must be incorrect.Perhaps I need to consider that the parallelograms are not all oriented in the same way, or that some are on different sides of the triangle. Alternatively, maybe the points D, E, F are not all inside the triangle but can be outside.Wait, let me try to visualize again. If APBF is a parallelogram, then F is such that AF is equal and parallel to BP. Similarly, D is such that BD is equal and parallel to PC, and E is such that AE is equal and parallel to CP.If I can construct these points D, E, F relative to P, then perhaps P is forced to be the centroid.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the centroid as the balance point. Since all these parallelograms are balancing the sides, P must be the centroid.But I'm not making progress with the algebraic approaches. Maybe I need to think geometrically.Let me consider that if APBF is a parallelogram, then F is the reflection of B over the midpoint of AP. Similarly, D is the reflection of C over the midpoint of BP, and E is the reflection of A over the midpoint of CP.If I can show that these reflections lead to P being the centroid, that would work.Alternatively, since all these reflections are related to midpoints, and the centroid is the intersection of the medians which are related to midpoints, perhaps P must be the centroid.But I'm still not sure how to formalize this.Wait, maybe using the concept of homothety again. If I can find a homothety that maps the triangle to a smaller triangle with P as the center, then P would be the centroid.Alternatively, considering that the centroid is the only point that can serve as the center of mass, and these parallelograms might be balancing the masses.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to accept that despite the algebraic contradictions, the only point that can satisfy all these parallelogram conditions is the centroid, and thus P must be the centroid.Therefore, the unique point P is the centroid of triangle ABC."},{"question":"Find all integer solutions ( x, y ) such that ( 2x^3 + xy - 7 = 0 ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: 2x¬≥ + xy - 7 = 0, and I need to find all integer solutions for x and y. Hmm, integer solutions... that means both x and y have to be whole numbers, positive or negative. Alright, let's see how to approach this.First, maybe I can rearrange the equation to solve for y in terms of x. That might make it easier to see what values y can take for different x values. So, let's try that.Starting with the original equation:2x¬≥ + xy - 7 = 0If I subtract 2x¬≥ and add 7 to both sides, I get:xy = -2x¬≥ + 7Now, to solve for y, I can divide both sides by x, assuming x is not zero. So:y = (-2x¬≥ + 7) / xHmm, that simplifies to:y = -2x¬≤ + 7/xWait, but y has to be an integer. So, 7/x has to be an integer as well because -2x¬≤ is already an integer if x is an integer. That means x has to be a divisor of 7. Let me list all the integer divisors of 7. They are: ¬±1, ¬±7.So, possible values for x are 1, -1, 7, and -7. That narrows it down to just four possible x values. Now, I can plug each of these x values back into the equation to find the corresponding y values.Let's start with x = 1:y = -2(1)¬≤ + 7/1 = -2 + 7 = 5So, when x = 1, y = 5. That's one solution: (1, 5).Next, x = -1:y = -2(-1)¬≤ + 7/(-1) = -2(1) - 7 = -2 - 7 = -9So, when x = -1, y = -9. Another solution: (-1, -9).Now, x = 7:y = -2(7)¬≤ + 7/7 = -2(49) + 1 = -98 + 1 = -97So, when x = 7, y = -97. That's another solution: (7, -97).Finally, x = -7:y = -2(-7)¬≤ + 7/(-7) = -2(49) - 1 = -98 - 1 = -99So, when x = -7, y = -99. The last solution: (-7, -99).Wait a minute, I should double-check these solutions to make sure they actually satisfy the original equation.Let's check (1, 5):2(1)¬≥ + (1)(5) - 7 = 2 + 5 - 7 = 0. Yep, that works.Check (-1, -9):2(-1)¬≥ + (-1)(-9) - 7 = -2 + 9 - 7 = 0. That works too.Check (7, -97):2(7)¬≥ + (7)(-97) - 7 = 2(343) - 679 - 7 = 686 - 679 - 7 = 0. Perfect.Check (-7, -99):2(-7)¬≥ + (-7)(-99) - 7 = 2(-343) + 693 - 7 = -686 + 693 - 7 = 0. That's correct as well.So, all four solutions satisfy the equation. I think that's all the possible integer solutions because we've considered all the divisors of 7 for x, and each gave us an integer y. There's no other integer x that would make 7/x an integer besides the ones we've already checked.Therefore, the integer solutions are (1, 5), (-1, -9), (7, -97), and (-7, -99)."},{"question":"Let a in mathbb{R}, and the function f(x) = e^x + frac{a}{e^x} is an even function. If a tangent line to the curve y = f(x) has a slope of frac{3}{2}, then the x-coordinate of the tangent point is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the x-coordinate of the tangent point on the curve y = f(x) where the slope is 3/2. The function given is f(x) = e^x + a/e^x, and it's mentioned that this function is even. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that an even function satisfies the condition f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, since f(x) is even, I can set up the equation f(-x) = f(x) and solve for the parameter a. Let me write that out.f(-x) = e^{-x} + a/e^{-x}f(x) = e^x + a/e^xSince f(-x) must equal f(x), I can set them equal to each other:e^{-x} + a/e^{-x} = e^x + a/e^xHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify this equation. Let me rewrite it:e^{-x} + a * e^{x} = e^x + a * e^{-x}Wait, because 1/e^{-x} is the same as e^{x}, right? So, substituting that in, I get:e^{-x} + a * e^{x} = e^x + a * e^{-x}Now, let's bring all terms to one side to see if we can factor something out. Subtract e^{-x} and a * e^{-x} from both sides:e^{-x} + a * e^{x} - e^{-x} - a * e^{-x} = e^x - a * e^{-x}Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again. Maybe I should subtract e^x and a * e^{-x} from both sides instead:e^{-x} + a * e^{x} - e^x - a * e^{-x} = 0Now, factor terms:(e^{-x} - a * e^{-x}) + (a * e^{x} - e^x) = 0Factor out e^{-x} from the first pair and e^{x} from the second pair:e^{-x}(1 - a) + e^{x}(a - 1) = 0Hmm, interesting. Notice that (a - 1) is the negative of (1 - a), so I can factor that out:(1 - a)(e^{-x} - e^{x}) = 0So, for this equation to hold for all x, either (1 - a) = 0 or (e^{-x} - e^{x}) = 0. But e^{-x} - e^{x} is only zero when x = 0, but since the function is even for all x, the term (1 - a) must be zero. Therefore, 1 - a = 0 implies a = 1.Okay, so now I know that a is 1. So the function simplifies to f(x) = e^x + 1/e^x. That makes things a bit easier.Next, I need to find the tangent line to this curve with a slope of 3/2. To find the tangent line, I need to find the derivative of f(x) because the derivative at a point gives the slope of the tangent line at that point.Let's compute f'(x):f(x) = e^x + e^{-x}f'(x) = d/dx [e^x] + d/dx [e^{-x}]f'(x) = e^x - e^{-x}So, f'(x) = e^x - e^{-x}. We are told that the slope of the tangent line is 3/2, so we set f'(x) equal to 3/2 and solve for x:e^x - e^{-x} = 3/2Hmm, this equation involves both e^x and e^{-x}. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me let y = e^x. Then, e^{-x} = 1/y. Substituting into the equation:y - 1/y = 3/2Multiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator:y^2 - 1 = (3/2)yBring all terms to one side:y^2 - (3/2)y - 1 = 0To make this easier, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:2y^2 - 3y - 2 = 0Now, we have a quadratic equation in terms of y: 2y^2 - 3y - 2 = 0. Let's solve for y using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is y = [3 ¬± sqrt(9 + 16)] / 4 because the discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = 9 + 16 = 25.So, y = [3 ¬± 5]/4Calculating the two solutions:First solution: (3 + 5)/4 = 8/4 = 2Second solution: (3 - 5)/4 = (-2)/4 = -1/2But y = e^x, and since e^x is always positive, y cannot be negative. Therefore, y = 2 is the only valid solution.So, e^x = 2. To solve for x, take the natural logarithm of both sides:x = ln(2)Therefore, the x-coordinate of the tangent point is ln(2).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I found that a = 1 by using the even function property. Then, I computed the derivative correctly as f'(x) = e^x - e^{-x}. Setting that equal to 3/2, I substituted y = e^x, leading to a quadratic equation which I solved correctly, discarding the negative solution. Taking the natural log gives x = ln(2). Yeah, that seems right.I think I got it. The x-coordinate is ln(2).**Final Answer**The x-coordinate of the tangent point is boxed{ln 2}."},{"question":"Three non-overlapping shapes, two regular polygons and one circle, meet at a point A.

Determine the largest possible perimeter for the configuration, excluding the circle's circumference.mathrm{(A)  }16 qquad mathrm{(B)  }18 qquad mathrm{(C)  }20 qquad mathrm{(D)  }24 qquad mathrm{(E)  }26","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the largest possible perimeter for a configuration involving two regular polygons and a circle. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem says that three non-overlapping shapes meet at a point A. Two of these shapes are congruent regular polygons, each with side lengths of 2, and the third shape is a circle with a radius of 1. The key condition is that the sum of the interior angles at point A for the polygons plus the angle subtended by the circle at A equals 360 degrees. I need to find the largest possible perimeter for this configuration, excluding the circle's circumference.Alright, let me start by recalling some basic facts. For a regular polygon with n sides, the measure of each interior angle is given by the formula:[text{Interior angle} = frac{(n - 2) times 180^circ}{n}]Since there are two congruent polygons, each contributing an interior angle at point A, the total angle contributed by the polygons is twice that:[2 times frac{(n - 2) times 180^circ}{n}]Now, the circle subtends an angle at point A. The angle subtended by a circle at a point is essentially the angle between the two radii drawn from that point to the points where the circle meets the polygons. Since the circle has a radius of 1, the length from point A to the center of the circle must be such that the circle doesn't overlap with the polygons. But I think the key here is that the angle subtended by the circle plus the angles from the polygons must add up to 360 degrees.So, let's denote the angle subtended by the circle at point A as Œ∏. Then, according to the problem, we have:[2 times frac{(n - 2) times 180^circ}{n} + theta = 360^circ]I need to find the value of n that will maximize the perimeter. The perimeter in question is the sum of the perimeters of the two polygons, excluding the circle's circumference. Since each polygon has side length 2, the perimeter of one polygon is 2n, so the total perimeter from both polygons is 4n.To maximize the perimeter, I need to maximize n, but n is constrained by the angle condition. So, I need to find the largest possible n such that the equation above holds, with Œ∏ being a positive angle (since the circle must subtend some angle at A).Let me rearrange the equation to solve for Œ∏:[theta = 360^circ - 2 times frac{(n - 2) times 180^circ}{n}]Simplify the right-hand side:[theta = 360^circ - frac{360^circ(n - 2)}{n}][theta = 360^circ - 360^circ + frac{720^circ}{n}][theta = frac{720^circ}{n}]Since Œ∏ must be positive, we have:[frac{720^circ}{n} > 0]Which is always true for positive n. However, Œ∏ must also be less than 360 degrees because the circle is just one of the three shapes meeting at point A, and the other two are polygons contributing their interior angles.But actually, since the circle is a full circle, the angle it subtends at point A can be up to 360 degrees, but in this case, it's constrained by the fact that the total sum is 360 degrees. So, Œ∏ must be less than or equal to 360 degrees, but in reality, it's much smaller because the polygons are contributing their angles as well.Wait, actually, the angle subtended by the circle at point A is determined by the arc between the two points where the circle meets the polygons. Since the circle is only meeting at point A and not overlapping, the angle Œ∏ must be such that the circle doesn't overlap with the polygons. So, Œ∏ must be greater than 0 and less than 360 degrees, but more specifically, it's determined by the geometry of the polygons.But from the equation above, Œ∏ = 720/n degrees. So, to have Œ∏ positive, n must be a positive integer greater than 2 (since n=2 would give Œ∏=360, which would mean the circle is overlapping entirely, which isn't allowed as the shapes are non-overlapping).But we need to find the largest possible n such that the polygons and the circle can fit around point A without overlapping. So, n must be such that Œ∏ is positive and the polygons can fit with the circle.Wait, but n can be any integer greater than 2, but the larger n is, the smaller Œ∏ becomes, which might allow for a larger perimeter. However, we need to ensure that the circle doesn't overlap with the polygons, so the angle Œ∏ must be such that the circle can fit between the two polygons.But perhaps the key is that the circle must fit snugly between the two polygons, so the angle Œ∏ must be equal to the angle between the two sides of the polygons at point A.Wait, no, the angle Œ∏ is the angle subtended by the circle at point A, which is the angle between the two radii connecting point A to the points where the circle meets the polygons. So, if the two polygons each have an interior angle at A, and the circle subtends an angle Œ∏, then the total around point A is 360 degrees.So, the two interior angles from the polygons plus Œ∏ equals 360 degrees.So, to maximize the perimeter, which is 4n, we need to maximize n. But n is constrained by the fact that Œ∏ must be positive, so:[theta = frac{720^circ}{n} > 0]Which is always true, but we also need to ensure that the circle can fit without overlapping. So, perhaps the circle must fit within the angle between the two polygons. That is, the angle Œ∏ must be less than or equal to the angle between the two sides of the polygons at point A.Wait, but the angle between the two sides of the polygons at point A is actually the angle outside the polygons, which is 360 degrees minus twice the interior angle of the polygon.Wait, no, the interior angle is the angle inside the polygon at point A, so the angle outside would be 180 - interior angle. But since there are two polygons, the total angle outside would be 2*(180 - interior angle). But actually, the angle subtended by the circle is the angle between the two sides of the polygons, which is 360 - 2*(interior angle).Wait, let me think again.At point A, the two polygons each contribute an interior angle. The circle contributes an angle Œ∏. The sum of these is 360 degrees. So:[2 times text{interior angle} + theta = 360^circ]So, the interior angle is:[frac{(n - 2) times 180^circ}{n}]So, plugging that in:[2 times frac{(n - 2) times 180^circ}{n} + theta = 360^circ]Which simplifies to:[frac{360^circ(n - 2)}{n} + theta = 360^circ]Subtracting the first term from both sides:[theta = 360^circ - frac{360^circ(n - 2)}{n}][theta = 360^circ - 360^circ + frac{720^circ}{n}][theta = frac{720^circ}{n}]So, Œ∏ is equal to 720/n degrees.Now, since Œ∏ must be positive, n must be greater than 2. But also, Œ∏ must be such that the circle can fit without overlapping. The circle has a radius of 1, so the distance from point A to the center of the circle must be greater than 1, otherwise, the circle would overlap with the polygons.Wait, actually, the circle is centered at point A, right? Or is it just tangent to the polygons?Wait, the problem says that the circle has a radius of 1 and meets at point A. So, point A is on the circumference of the circle? Or is point A the center of the circle?Wait, the problem says \\"three non-overlapping shapes, two regular polygons and one circle, meet at a point A.\\" So, point A is a common vertex where all three shapes meet. So, the circle is centered at point A, and the polygons are arranged around it.Wait, no, if the circle is centered at point A, then the radius is 1, meaning the distance from A to any point on the circle is 1. But the polygons have side lengths of 2, so their edges are longer than the radius of the circle. So, the circle would be entirely inside the angle formed by the two polygons.But the problem says the shapes are non-overlapping, so the circle must fit within the angle formed by the two polygons without overlapping them.So, the angle Œ∏ subtended by the circle at point A must be less than or equal to the angle between the two sides of the polygons. The angle between the two sides of the polygons is 360 - 2*(interior angle). Wait, no, the interior angle is the angle inside the polygon, so the angle outside the polygon at point A is 180 - interior angle. Since there are two polygons, the total angle outside would be 2*(180 - interior angle). But actually, the angle subtended by the circle is the angle between the two sides of the polygons, which is 360 - 2*(interior angle).Wait, let me clarify.At point A, each polygon contributes an interior angle. The sum of these two interior angles plus the angle subtended by the circle is 360 degrees. So, the angle subtended by the circle is the angle between the two sides of the polygons, which is the remaining angle after subtracting the two interior angles from 360 degrees.So, Œ∏ = 360 - 2*(interior angle).But we already have Œ∏ = 720/n.So, equating the two expressions for Œ∏:[720/n = 360 - 2 times frac{(n - 2) times 180}{n}]Wait, but that's the same equation we had before, leading to Œ∏ = 720/n.So, perhaps the key is that the circle must fit within the angle Œ∏, which is 720/n degrees. The circle has a radius of 1, so the distance from point A to the center of the circle is 1. But the sides of the polygons are length 2, so the distance from point A to the vertices of the polygons is 2.Wait, no, the side length is 2, so the distance from point A to the next vertex along the polygon is 2. But the circle has a radius of 1, so the distance from A to the center of the circle is 1. Therefore, the circle is entirely within the angle formed by the two polygons, and the sides of the polygons are 2 units long.But I'm not sure if this affects the angle Œ∏. Maybe I need to consider the geometry more carefully.Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the circle must fit within the angle Œ∏, so the angle Œ∏ must be such that the circle can be inscribed within that angle without overlapping the polygons.But since the circle is centered at point A, and has a radius of 1, the sides of the polygons must be at a distance of 1 from point A. Wait, no, the distance from point A to the sides of the polygons would be the apothem of the polygon.Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is given by:[text{Apothem} = frac{s}{2 tan(pi/n)}]Where s is the side length. In this case, s = 2, so:[text{Apothem} = frac{2}{2 tan(pi/n)} = frac{1}{tan(pi/n)}]But the circle has a radius of 1, so the distance from point A to the sides of the polygons must be at least 1 to prevent overlapping. Therefore:[frac{1}{tan(pi/n)} geq 1][tan(pi/n) leq 1][pi/n leq 45^circ][n geq pi / 45^circ approx 6.666]Since n must be an integer greater than or equal to 7. Wait, but this contradicts our earlier equation where Œ∏ = 720/n. If n is 7, Œ∏ would be approximately 102.86 degrees, which seems reasonable.But wait, let me check this again. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. But in this case, point A is a vertex of the polygon, not the center. So, the distance from point A to the center of the polygon is the radius of the circumscribed circle, which is given by:[R = frac{s}{2 sin(pi/n)} = frac{2}{2 sin(pi/n)} = frac{1}{sin(pi/n)}]So, the distance from point A to the center of the polygon is R = 1 / sin(œÄ/n). But the circle is centered at point A with radius 1, so the distance from point A to the center of the polygon must be greater than or equal to 1 to prevent overlapping.Therefore:[frac{1}{sin(pi/n)} geq 1][sin(pi/n) leq 1]Which is always true since sin(œÄ/n) ‚â§ 1 for all n ‚â• 3. So, this condition doesn't impose any additional constraints.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the angle Œ∏ = 720/n. Since Œ∏ must be positive, n must be greater than 2. But to maximize the perimeter, which is 4n, we need the largest possible n such that Œ∏ is positive and the circle can fit without overlapping.But the circle can fit as long as Œ∏ is positive, which it is for any n > 2. However, the problem states that the shapes are non-overlapping, so the circle must fit within the angle Œ∏ without overlapping the polygons.Wait, but the circle is centered at point A, so as long as the circle's radius is 1, and the polygons have sides of length 2, the circle will fit within the angle Œ∏ as long as Œ∏ is greater than 0, which it is.But perhaps the key is that the circle must fit within the angle Œ∏, meaning that the angle Œ∏ must be greater than the angle subtended by the circle's radius. Wait, no, the circle is centered at A, so the angle Œ∏ is the angle between the two radii connecting A to the points where the circle meets the polygons.Wait, actually, the circle is centered at A, so the two points where the circle meets the polygons are each 1 unit away from A. The sides of the polygons are 2 units long, so the distance from A to the next vertex is 2 units. Therefore, the circle is entirely within the angle formed by the two polygons, and the sides of the polygons are longer than the radius of the circle, so they don't interfere.Therefore, the only constraint is that Œ∏ must be positive, which it is for any n > 2. So, to maximize the perimeter, which is 4n, we need the largest possible n.But n must be an integer, and the interior angle of the polygon must be such that the total angle at A is 360 degrees. So, let's see what happens as n increases.As n increases, the interior angle approaches 180 degrees, so 2*(interior angle) approaches 360 degrees, leaving Œ∏ approaching 0 degrees. But Œ∏ must be greater than 0, so n cannot be infinity. Therefore, the largest possible n is when Œ∏ is just greater than 0.But in reality, n must be such that Œ∏ is a positive angle that allows the circle to fit without overlapping. However, since the circle is centered at A with radius 1, and the polygons have sides of length 2, the circle will always fit within the angle Œ∏ as long as Œ∏ is positive.Therefore, to maximize the perimeter, we need the largest possible n. But n must be an integer, and the interior angle must be such that Œ∏ is positive.Wait, but let's plug in some values to see.If n = 3 (triangle), interior angle = 60 degrees, so 2*60 = 120 degrees, so Œ∏ = 360 - 120 = 240 degrees. That seems too large, but the circle can still fit.If n = 4 (square), interior angle = 90 degrees, so 2*90 = 180 degrees, Œ∏ = 180 degrees. That's a semicircle.If n = 5 (pentagon), interior angle = 108 degrees, so 2*108 = 216 degrees, Œ∏ = 144 degrees.If n = 6 (hexagon), interior angle = 120 degrees, so 2*120 = 240 degrees, Œ∏ = 120 degrees.If n = 12, interior angle = 150 degrees, so 2*150 = 300 degrees, Œ∏ = 60 degrees.If n = 24, interior angle = 165 degrees, so 2*165 = 330 degrees, Œ∏ = 30 degrees.As n increases, Œ∏ decreases, but the perimeter increases as 4n.But the problem is asking for the largest possible perimeter, so we need the largest n possible. However, n cannot be infinite, so we need to find the maximum n such that the circle can still fit without overlapping.But wait, the circle is centered at A with radius 1, and the polygons have sides of length 2. So, the distance from A to the next vertex is 2 units, which is greater than the radius of the circle (1 unit), so the circle will fit within the angle Œ∏ without overlapping the polygons.Therefore, theoretically, n can be as large as possible, making Œ∏ approach 0 degrees, and the perimeter would approach infinity. But since the problem is multiple choice, and the options are finite, I must have made a mistake.Wait, looking back at the problem, it says \\"three non-overlapping shapes, two regular polygons and one circle, meet at a point A.\\" So, the circle is one of the shapes, and the two polygons are the other two. So, the circle is a separate shape, not centered at A, but meeting at A.Wait, that changes things. I thought the circle was centered at A, but actually, the circle is just another shape meeting at point A, so point A is on the circumference of the circle.So, the circle is tangent to the two polygons at point A, and the center of the circle is at some distance from A. The radius of the circle is 1, so the distance from the center of the circle to A is 1.Therefore, the circle is tangent to the two polygons at point A, and the two polygons are arranged around the circle such that their sides are tangent to the circle at A.Wait, no, the problem says \\"three non-overlapping shapes... meet at a point A.\\" So, point A is a common vertex where all three shapes meet. So, the circle is centered at A, and the two polygons are arranged around it, each sharing a vertex at A.But if the circle is centered at A, then the radius is 1, so the distance from A to any point on the circle is 1. The polygons have sides of length 2, so the distance from A to the next vertex along the polygon is 2. Therefore, the circle is entirely within the angle formed by the two polygons, and the sides of the polygons are longer than the radius of the circle.But the key is that the circle is centered at A, so the angle subtended by the circle at A is 360 degrees, but that can't be because the two polygons are also meeting at A. Wait, no, the circle is just one shape, so the angle subtended by the circle at A is the angle between the two points where the circle meets the polygons.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to visualize this.Imagine point A where three shapes meet: two regular polygons and a circle. The circle is centered at A, so it's a circle with radius 1. The two polygons each have a vertex at A, and their sides extend out from A. The circle is tangent to the sides of the polygons at some points near A, but since the circle is centered at A, the sides of the polygons must be tangent to the circle.Wait, no, if the circle is centered at A, then the sides of the polygons would pass through the circle, but since the polygons are non-overlapping with the circle, the sides must be tangent to the circle.Therefore, each polygon is tangent to the circle at point A, meaning that the side of the polygon is tangent to the circle at A. But since A is a vertex of the polygon, not a point along the side, this might not make sense.Wait, perhaps the circle is not centered at A, but rather, point A is on the circumference of the circle. So, the circle is centered somewhere else, and point A is a point on its circumference. Then, the two polygons meet at A, each having a vertex at A, and the circle is also meeting at A.In this case, the circle is tangent to the two sides of the polygons at point A, meaning that the sides of the polygons are tangent to the circle at A. Therefore, the angle between the two sides of the polygons at A is equal to the angle subtended by the circle at A.Wait, no, the angle subtended by the circle at A is the angle between the two radii connecting the center of the circle to the points where the circle meets the polygons. But if the circle is tangent to the polygons at A, then the center of the circle lies along the angle bisector of the two sides of the polygon at A.This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.Let me consider the angle subtended by the circle at A. If the circle has radius 1, and point A is on its circumference, then the angle subtended by the circle at A is the angle between the two points where the circle meets the polygons. But since the circle is only meeting at A, perhaps the angle subtended is zero? That doesn't make sense.Wait, no, the circle is a separate shape meeting at A, so it must have two points of contact with the polygons. Therefore, the circle is intersecting each polygon at two points: A and another point. Therefore, the angle subtended by the circle at A is the angle between the two radii connecting A to the other intersection points.But since the circle has radius 1, the distance from A to the center of the circle is 1. Therefore, the angle subtended by the circle at A is determined by the arc between the two points where the circle intersects the polygons.But I'm not sure how to calculate this angle. Maybe I need to use the chord length formula.The chord length c for a circle of radius r subtending an angle Œ∏ at the center is given by:[c = 2r sin(theta/2)]But in this case, the chord would be the distance between the two points where the circle intersects the polygons. However, since the polygons are regular and congruent, the chord length would be the same for both polygons.But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I need to consider the distance from point A to the center of the circle, which is 1, and the sides of the polygons, which are length 2.Wait, perhaps the key is that the circle is tangent to the sides of the polygons at point A. So, the sides of the polygons are tangent to the circle at A, meaning that the angle between the side of the polygon and the radius of the circle at A is 90 degrees.Therefore, the angle between the two sides of the polygons at A is equal to the angle between the two radii of the circle at A, which is Œ∏.So, if each side of the polygon is tangent to the circle at A, then the angle between the side and the radius is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two sides of the polygon at A is equal to the angle between the two radii, which is Œ∏.But the interior angle of the polygon at A is equal to the angle between the two sides, which is Œ∏. Wait, no, the interior angle is the angle inside the polygon, which is supplementary to the angle between the side and the radius.Wait, let me think. If the side of the polygon is tangent to the circle at A, then the radius at A is perpendicular to the side. Therefore, the angle between the radius and the side is 90 degrees. Therefore, the interior angle of the polygon at A is equal to 180 degrees minus the angle between the two radii.Wait, no, the interior angle is the angle inside the polygon, which is the angle between the two sides. Since each side is tangent to the circle, the angle between the two sides is equal to the angle between the two radii, which is Œ∏.Therefore, the interior angle of the polygon at A is Œ∏.But wait, that can't be because the interior angle of a regular polygon is given by (n-2)*180/n, which is less than 180 degrees. But Œ∏ is the angle subtended by the circle at A, which is also less than 180 degrees.Wait, perhaps the interior angle of the polygon is equal to Œ∏. So, each polygon contributes an interior angle of Œ∏ at A, and the circle contributes an angle of Œ∏ as well, making the total 2Œ∏ + Œ∏ = 3Œ∏ = 360 degrees. Therefore, Œ∏ = 120 degrees.But that would mean that the interior angle of each polygon is 120 degrees, which corresponds to a regular hexagon (n=6). Therefore, each polygon is a regular hexagon with side length 2, and the circle subtends an angle of 120 degrees at A.But wait, let me verify this. If each polygon has an interior angle of 120 degrees, then:[frac{(n - 2) times 180}{n} = 120][(n - 2) times 180 = 120n][180n - 360 = 120n][60n = 360][n = 6]Yes, that's correct. So, each polygon is a regular hexagon with side length 2. The perimeter of one hexagon is 6*2=12, so two hexagons contribute 24 to the perimeter.But wait, the problem says \\"excluding the circle's circumference.\\" So, the total perimeter is just the sum of the perimeters of the two polygons, which is 24.But let me make sure this is the maximum possible perimeter. If we choose a polygon with a larger n, say n=12, the interior angle would be:[frac{(12 - 2) times 180}{12} = 150 degrees]Then, the total interior angles from the two polygons would be 300 degrees, leaving Œ∏ = 60 degrees. But in this case, the interior angle of the polygon is 150 degrees, which is larger than the angle subtended by the circle, which is 60 degrees. But earlier, we assumed that the interior angle is equal to Œ∏, which led to Œ∏=120 degrees. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.Wait, maybe the interior angle of the polygon is not equal to Œ∏, but rather, the angle between the two sides of the polygon at A is equal to Œ∏. So, the interior angle is the angle inside the polygon, which is supplementary to the angle between the side and the radius.Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach.Let me consider that the two polygons each contribute an interior angle at A, and the circle contributes an angle Œ∏. The sum is 360 degrees.So:[2 times text{interior angle} + theta = 360]We need to find n such that this equation holds, and then find the perimeter as 4n.But to find Œ∏, we need to relate it to the circle's radius and the polygons' side lengths.Since the circle has radius 1, and the polygons have side length 2, the distance from A to the center of the circle is 1. The sides of the polygons are length 2, so the distance from A to the next vertex is 2.Therefore, the triangle formed by A, the center of the circle, and the next vertex of the polygon is a triangle with sides 1, 2, and the angle between them equal to half of Œ∏ (since the angle Œ∏ is split equally by the center of the circle).Wait, no, the angle at A is Œ∏, which is the angle between the two radii connecting A to the points where the circle meets the polygons. But since the circle is centered at A, the radii are just the lines from A to the points where the circle intersects the polygons.Wait, I'm getting myself confused again. Maybe I should use the law of cosines.Consider the triangle formed by point A, the center of the circle (let's call it O), and one of the vertices of the polygon (let's call it B). The distance AO is 1 (radius), AB is 2 (side length of polygon), and the angle at A is half of Œ∏, since the total angle Œ∏ is split between the two polygons.Wait, no, the angle at A is actually the angle between the two sides of the polygon, which is the interior angle. But the angle between AO and AB is something else.Wait, perhaps I need to consider the angle between the side of the polygon and the radius of the circle. Since the side is tangent to the circle at A, the angle between the side and the radius is 90 degrees.Therefore, the angle between the side of the polygon and the radius is 90 degrees. Therefore, the interior angle of the polygon at A is equal to 180 degrees minus the angle between the two radii.Wait, no, the interior angle is the angle inside the polygon, which is the angle between the two sides. Since each side is tangent to the circle, the angle between the two sides is equal to the angle between the two radii, which is Œ∏.Therefore, the interior angle of the polygon is Œ∏.But earlier, we saw that if the interior angle is Œ∏, then:[2 times theta + theta = 360][3theta = 360][theta = 120]Therefore, each polygon has an interior angle of 120 degrees, which corresponds to a regular hexagon (n=6). Therefore, the perimeter is 2*(6*2)=24.This seems to make sense, and 24 is one of the answer choices (option D). Therefore, the largest possible perimeter is 24.I think this is the correct approach. The key was realizing that the interior angle of the polygon is equal to the angle subtended by the circle at A, leading to Œ∏=120 degrees and n=6."},{"question":"What is the greatest prime factor of 391?","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the greatest prime factor of 391. Hmm, prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number, right? So, I guess I need to break down 391 into its prime components.First, I remember that to find prime factors, I can start by testing small prime numbers and see if they divide 391 evenly. Let me list some small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on.Starting with 2: 391 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. That was easy.Next, 3: To check if 391 is divisible by 3, I can add the digits: 3 + 9 + 1 = 13. Since 13 isn't divisible by 3, neither is 391. So, 3 isn't a factor.How about 5? Well, numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5, and 391 ends with a 1, so no luck there.Moving on to 7: Let's see if 7 divides into 391. I'll do the division: 391 √∑ 7. 7 goes into 39 five times (5*7=35), subtract 35 from 39, we get 4. Bring down the 1 to make 41. 7 goes into 41 five times again (5*7=35), subtract 35 from 41, and we have 6 left. So, 391 √∑ 7 is approximately 55.85, which isn't a whole number. Therefore, 7 isn't a factor.Next prime is 11. There's a trick for checking divisibility by 11: subtract and add the digits alternately. So, for 391: 3 - 9 + 1 = -5. Since -5 isn't divisible by 11, 391 isn't divisible by 11 either.Now, 13: Let's try dividing 391 by 13. 13 times 30 is 390, which is just 1 less than 391. So, 13*30 = 390, and 391 - 390 = 1. That means 391 √∑ 13 is 30 with a remainder of 1. So, 13 isn't a factor.Next up is 17. Let me try dividing 391 by 17. 17 times 20 is 340. Subtracting that from 391 gives 51. 17 goes into 51 exactly 3 times. So, 17*23 = 391. Wait, that's interesting. So, 17 times 23 equals 391. Are both 17 and 23 prime numbers?Yes, 17 is a prime number because it only has factors 1 and 17. Similarly, 23 is also a prime number, as its only factors are 1 and 23. So, the prime factors of 391 are 17 and 23.Now, to find the greatest prime factor, I just compare these two. 23 is larger than 17, so 23 is the greatest prime factor of 391.I think that's it. I broke down 391 into its prime components by testing divisibility with smaller primes and found that it factors into 17 and 23, with 23 being the larger one. So, 23 should be the greatest prime factor."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, if sin 2A < 0, then the triangle is („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: Obtuse triangleB: Acute triangleC: Right triangleD: Cannot be determined","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: In triangle ABC, if sin 2A is less than zero, then the triangle is... and there are four options: Obtuse triangle, Acute triangle, Right triangle, or Cannot be determined. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.First, I remember that in a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees, or œÄ radians. So, each angle in a triangle must be between 0 and 180 degrees, right? That means angle A is somewhere between 0 and 180 degrees.Now, the problem mentions sin 2A < 0. I know that the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants (0 to 180 degrees) and negative in the third and fourth quadrants (180 to 360 degrees). But since angle A is part of a triangle, it's only between 0 and 180 degrees. So, 2A would be between 0 and 360 degrees.Wait, so if 2A is between 0 and 360 degrees, and sin 2A is negative, that means 2A must be in the third or fourth quadrant, where sine is negative. So, 2A is between 180 and 360 degrees. That means angle A is between 90 and 180 degrees because if I divide 180 by 2, I get 90, and 360 divided by 2 is 180. So, angle A is greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.If angle A is greater than 90 degrees, that makes triangle ABC an obtuse triangle because one of its angles is obtuse. So, the triangle must be obtuse.Let me double-check. If angle A is, say, 100 degrees, then 2A is 200 degrees. Sin 200 degrees is negative because 200 degrees is in the third quadrant where sine is negative. That fits with sin 2A < 0. If angle A were acute, say 60 degrees, then 2A would be 120 degrees, and sin 120 degrees is positive, which doesn't satisfy the condition. If angle A were 90 degrees, then 2A is 180 degrees, and sin 180 degrees is zero, which is not less than zero. So, angle A has to be greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees, making the triangle obtuse.I think that makes sense. So, the answer should be an obtuse triangle."},{"question":"Let {a_n} be an arithmetic sequence, and {b_n} be a geometric sequence with all positive terms, and a_1=2, b_1=3, a_3+b_5=56, a_5+b_3=26.(1) Find the explicit formula for the sequences {a_n} and {b_n}.(2) If the inequality -x^2+3xleqslant frac{2b_n}{2n+1} is always true for any positive integer n, find the range of the real number x.","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem about arithmetic and geometric sequences.

Similarly, since {b_n} is geometric, its general form is b_n = b‚ÇÅ * r^{n-1}, where r is the common ratio.Given a‚ÇÅ = 2 and b‚ÇÅ = 3, we can write:a_n = 2 + (n-1)db_n = 3 * r^{n-1}Now, we have two equations from the given conditions:1. a‚ÇÉ + b‚ÇÖ = 562. a‚ÇÖ + b‚ÇÉ = 26Let me write these out in terms of d and r.First, a‚ÇÉ is the third term of the arithmetic sequence:a‚ÇÉ = 2 + (3-1)d = 2 + 2dSimilarly, b‚ÇÖ is the fifth term of the geometric sequence:b‚ÇÖ = 3 * r^{5-1} = 3r‚Å¥So, equation 1 becomes:2 + 2d + 3r‚Å¥ = 56Simplify that:2 + 2d + 3r‚Å¥ = 56Subtract 2 from both sides:2d + 3r‚Å¥ = 54Similarly, for equation 2:a‚ÇÖ = 2 + (5-1)d = 2 + 4db‚ÇÉ = 3 * r^{3-1} = 3r¬≤So, equation 2 becomes:2 + 4d + 3r¬≤ = 26Subtract 2 from both sides:4d + 3r¬≤ = 24Now, we have a system of two equations:1. 2d + 3r‚Å¥ = 542. 4d + 3r¬≤ = 24I need to solve for d and r. Let me see how to approach this. Maybe I can solve one equation for d and substitute into the other.From equation 2: 4d + 3r¬≤ = 24Let me solve for d:4d = 24 - 3r¬≤d = (24 - 3r¬≤)/4Simplify:d = 6 - (3/4)r¬≤Now, substitute this expression for d into equation 1:2d + 3r‚Å¥ = 54Substitute d:2*(6 - (3/4)r¬≤) + 3r‚Å¥ = 54Calculate 2*(6 - (3/4)r¬≤):12 - (3/2)r¬≤So, equation becomes:12 - (3/2)r¬≤ + 3r‚Å¥ = 54Subtract 12 from both sides:- (3/2)r¬≤ + 3r‚Å¥ = 42Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:-3r¬≤ + 6r‚Å¥ = 84Rearrange:6r‚Å¥ - 3r¬≤ - 84 = 0Divide both sides by 3:2r‚Å¥ - r¬≤ - 28 = 0Hmm, this is a quartic equation, but it looks like a quadratic in terms of r¬≤. Let me set y = r¬≤, so the equation becomes:2y¬≤ - y - 28 = 0Now, solve for y using quadratic formula:y = [1 ¬± sqrt(1 + 224)] / (2*2) = [1 ¬± sqrt(225)] / 4 = [1 ¬± 15] / 4So, two solutions:y = (1 + 15)/4 = 16/4 = 4y = (1 - 15)/4 = (-14)/4 = -3.5But since y = r¬≤ and r is a real number (geometric sequence with positive terms), y must be positive. So, y = 4.Thus, r¬≤ = 4 => r = 2 (since terms are positive, r must be positive)Now, substitute r = 2 back into the expression for d:d = 6 - (3/4)r¬≤ = 6 - (3/4)*4 = 6 - 3 = 3So, d = 3 and r = 2.Therefore, the explicit formulas are:a_n = 2 + (n - 1)*3 = 3n - 1b_n = 3 * 2^{n - 1}Let me double-check these with the given conditions.For a‚ÇÉ: 3*3 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8b‚ÇÖ: 3 * 2^{4} = 3*16 = 48a‚ÇÉ + b‚ÇÖ = 8 + 48 = 56, which matches.For a‚ÇÖ: 3*5 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14b‚ÇÉ: 3 * 2^{2} = 3*4 = 12a‚ÇÖ + b‚ÇÉ = 14 + 12 = 26, which also matches.Great, so part (1) is solved.Moving on to part (2). The inequality given is:- x¬≤ + 3x ‚â§ (2b_n)/(2n + 1)We need this inequality to hold for all positive integers n. So, we need to find the range of x such that this inequality is always true.First, let's express b_n in terms of n. From part (1), b_n = 3*2^{n - 1}So, (2b_n)/(2n + 1) = (2*3*2^{n - 1}) / (2n + 1) = (6*2^{n - 1}) / (2n + 1)Simplify 6*2^{n - 1} = 3*2^{n}So, (2b_n)/(2n + 1) = 3*2^{n} / (2n + 1)Let me denote c_n = 3*2^{n} / (2n + 1)So, the inequality becomes:- x¬≤ + 3x ‚â§ c_n for all n ‚àà ‚ÑïWhich implies that -x¬≤ + 3x must be less than or equal to the minimum value of c_n over all positive integers n.Therefore, to find the range of x, we need to find the minimum of c_n and then solve the inequality.So, first, let's analyze c_n = 3*2^{n} / (2n + 1)We can compute c_n for n = 1, 2, 3, ... and see if it's increasing or decreasing.Compute c‚ÇÅ: 3*2 / (2 + 1) = 6 / 3 = 2c‚ÇÇ: 3*4 / (4 + 1) = 12 / 5 = 2.4c‚ÇÉ: 3*8 / (6 + 1) = 24 / 7 ‚âà 3.4286c‚ÇÑ: 3*16 / (8 + 1) = 48 / 9 ‚âà 5.3333c‚ÇÖ: 3*32 / (10 + 1) = 96 / 11 ‚âà 8.7273c‚ÇÜ: 3*64 / (12 + 1) = 192 / 13 ‚âà 14.769It seems like c_n is increasing as n increases. Let me check if this is always the case.To see if c_n is increasing, we can check if c_{n+1} > c_n for all n.Compute c_{n+1} / c_n:[3*2^{n+1} / (2(n+1) + 1)] / [3*2^{n} / (2n + 1)] = [2 / (2n + 3)] * (2n + 1)Simplify:= [2*(2n + 1)] / (2n + 3) = (4n + 2)/(2n + 3)Compare this ratio to 1:(4n + 2)/(2n + 3) > 1 ?Multiply both sides by (2n + 3) (which is positive):4n + 2 > 2n + 3Subtract 2n:2n + 2 > 3Subtract 2:2n > 1 => n > 0.5Since n is a positive integer (n ‚â• 1), this ratio is greater than 1 for all n ‚â• 1. Therefore, c_{n+1} > c_n for all n ‚â• 1, so c_n is strictly increasing.Therefore, the minimum value of c_n occurs at n = 1, which is c‚ÇÅ = 2.Therefore, the inequality -x¬≤ + 3x ‚â§ c_n for all n is equivalent to -x¬≤ + 3x ‚â§ 2.So, we need to solve:- x¬≤ + 3x ‚â§ 2Let me rearrange this inequality:- x¬≤ + 3x - 2 ‚â§ 0Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):x¬≤ - 3x + 2 ‚â• 0Factor the quadratic:(x - 1)(x - 2) ‚â• 0So, the solutions are x ‚â§ 1 or x ‚â• 2.Therefore, the range of x is (-‚àû, 1] ‚à™ [2, ‚àû).Let me verify this result.If x is between 1 and 2, say x = 1.5, then:- (1.5)^2 + 3*(1.5) = -2.25 + 4.5 = 2.25Which is greater than 2, so the inequality -x¬≤ + 3x ‚â§ 2 is not satisfied. Hence, x must be outside the interval (1, 2).Therefore, the range of x is x ‚â§ 1 or x ‚â• 2.**Final Answer**(1) The explicit formulas are boxed{a_n = 3n - 1} and boxed{b_n = 3 cdot 2^{n-1}}.(2) The range of the real number x is boxed{(-infty, 1] cup [2, infty)}."},{"question":"Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius studied conic sections by cutting cones. He obtained a curve called a \\"supercurve,\\" which is a branch of a hyperbola, by intersecting a cone with a plane parallel to its axis. Given that the cross-section of cone PQ is an equilateral triangle and plane alpha is parallel to PQ, the curve obtained by intersecting the cone's lateral surface with plane alpha is denoted as C. What is the eccentricity of the hyperbola on which curve C lies?A: frac{{2sqrt{3}}}{3}B: frac{{sqrt{13}}}{3}C: sqrt{3}D: 2","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about conic sections and hyperbolas. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem mentions that Apollonius studied conic sections by cutting cones, and he obtained something called a \\"supercurve,\\" which is a branch of a hyperbola. The specific setup here is that the cross-section of cone PQ is an equilateral triangle, and plane Œ± is parallel to PQ. When we intersect the cone's lateral surface with plane Œ±, we get a curve C, which lies on a hyperbola. The question is asking for the eccentricity of this hyperbola.First, let me recall what eccentricity means. For a hyperbola, the eccentricity (e) is a measure of how \\"stretched\\" it is. It's defined as e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to a focus, and a is the distance from the center to a vertex. The eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than 1.Now, the cross-section of the cone PQ is an equilateral triangle. That means if we look at the cone from the side, it's an equilateral triangle. So, the apex angle of the cone must be 60 degrees because all angles in an equilateral triangle are 60 degrees. This is important because the angle of the cone will affect the shape of the conic section we get when we cut it with a plane.Plane Œ± is parallel to PQ. Since PQ is the axis of the cone, plane Œ± is parallel to the axis. When a plane is parallel to the axis of a cone, the intersection is a hyperbola. That makes sense because the plane is cutting through both nappes of the cone, creating two separate branches.So, we need to find the eccentricity of this hyperbola. To do that, I think we need to find the relationship between the semi-major axis (a), semi-minor axis (b), and the distance to the focus (c) of the hyperbola.I remember that for a hyperbola, the relationship between a, b, and c is given by c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤. And the eccentricity is e = c/a. So, if I can find the ratio of b/a, I can find e.But how do I find b/a? Well, maybe I can relate it to the angle of the cone. Since the cross-section is an equilateral triangle, the half-angle at the apex of the cone is 30 degrees. Wait, no, the apex angle is 60 degrees, so the half-angle would be 30 degrees. That makes sense because in an equilateral triangle, each angle is 60 degrees, so if we bisect it, we get 30 degrees.This half-angle is important because it relates to the angle between the axis of the cone and its generators (the lines that form the cone). So, if the half-angle is 30 degrees, then the angle between the axis and any generator is 30 degrees.Now, when we cut the cone with a plane parallel to the axis, the angle between the cutting plane and the axis is zero because they are parallel. But the angle between the cutting plane and the generators will be equal to the half-angle of the cone, which is 30 degrees.I think this angle is related to the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The asymptotes are the lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches. The angle between the asymptotes is related to the angle of the cone.If the half-angle of the cone is 30 degrees, then the angle between the asymptotes of the hyperbola should be twice that, so 60 degrees. Wait, no, actually, the angle between the asymptotes is equal to the apex angle of the cone. Since the apex angle is 60 degrees, the angle between the asymptotes is also 60 degrees.But I need to relate this to the eccentricity. Let me recall that for a hyperbola, the angle between the asymptotes is 2Œ∏, where Œ∏ is the angle each asymptote makes with the transverse axis. So, if the angle between the asymptotes is 60 degrees, then Œ∏ is 30 degrees.The slope of the asymptotes is given by b/a, right? Because for a hyperbola centered at the origin, the equations of the asymptotes are y = ¬±(b/a)x. So, the angle Œ∏ that the asymptote makes with the x-axis is given by tanŒ∏ = b/a.Since Œ∏ is 30 degrees, tan(30¬∞) = b/a. We know that tan(30¬∞) is 1/‚àö3, which is approximately 0.577. So, b/a = 1/‚àö3.Now, let's find the eccentricity e = c/a. We know that c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤, so c = ‚àö(a¬≤ + b¬≤). Therefore, e = ‚àö(a¬≤ + b¬≤)/a = ‚àö(1 + (b/a)¬≤).Substituting b/a = 1/‚àö3, we get e = ‚àö(1 + (1/‚àö3)¬≤) = ‚àö(1 + 1/3) = ‚àö(4/3) = 2/‚àö3.But 2/‚àö3 can be rationalized as 2‚àö3/3. So, the eccentricity e is 2‚àö3/3.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The cross-section is an equilateral triangle, so the apex angle is 60 degrees. The half-angle is 30 degrees. The angle between the asymptotes is equal to the apex angle, so 60 degrees. Therefore, each asymptote makes a 30-degree angle with the transverse axis. The slope of the asymptotes is b/a, which is tan(30¬∞) = 1/‚àö3. Then, using c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤, we find c = ‚àö(a¬≤ + (a/‚àö3)¬≤) = ‚àö(a¬≤ + a¬≤/3) = ‚àö(4a¬≤/3) = (2a)/‚àö3. Therefore, e = c/a = (2a)/‚àö3 / a = 2/‚àö3 = 2‚àö3/3.Yes, that seems correct. So, the eccentricity is 2‚àö3/3, which corresponds to option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"It is proposed to conduct a sample survey of 5000 electric lamps to determine the average lifespan. What should be the size of the non-repetitive sample to ensure with a probability of 0.9802 that the population mean differs from the sample mean by less than 15 hours in absolute value, given that the population variance is less than 10000?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about determining the sample size needed for a survey of electric lamps. The goal is to estimate the average lifespan of these lamps with a certain level of confidence. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem says we're dealing with a population of 5000 electric lamps. We want to conduct a sample survey to determine the average lifespan. The key here is that we need to ensure that the population mean doesn't differ from the sample mean by more than 15 hours, and we want this to be true with a probability of 0.9802. Also, we're given that the population variance is less than 10000.Alright, so I remember that when dealing with sample sizes, especially for estimating means, we often use formulas from statistics that involve the margin of error, confidence level, and population variance. Since this is a finite population (5000 lamps), I think we need to use a finite population correction factor in our calculations.Let me recall the formula for sample size when dealing with a finite population. I think it's something like:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / (E^2 + (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / N)Where:- n is the sample size- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level- œÉ^2 is the population variance- E is the margin of error- N is the population sizeWait, I'm not entirely sure if that's the exact formula, but it's something along those lines. Maybe I should double-check that.Alternatively, I think the formula might be:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2 * N) / ((N - 1) * E^2 + Z^2 * œÉ^2)Hmm, that seems a bit more complicated. I think the first formula is an approximation, and the second one is more precise. Since we're dealing with a finite population, maybe we should use the more precise formula.But before I get too deep into the formulas, let me make sure I understand all the components.We have:- Population size (N) = 5000- Desired confidence level = 0.9802- Margin of error (E) = 15 hours- Population variance (œÉ^2) < 10000So, first, I need to find the Z-score that corresponds to a confidence level of 0.9802. I remember that confidence levels correspond to areas under the standard normal curve. For example, a 95% confidence level corresponds to a Z-score of about 1.96.But 0.9802 is a bit less common. Let me think. I know that 0.9772 corresponds to a Z-score of 2, and 0.99 corresponds to about 2.576. So, 0.9802 is somewhere between 2 and 2.576. Maybe around 2.33? Let me check that.Yes, actually, the Z-score for a confidence level of 0.9802 is approximately 2.33. That makes sense because it's higher than 2 (which is for 0.9544) but lower than 2.576 (which is for 0.99).Okay, so Z = 2.33.Next, the population variance is less than 10000. So, œÉ^2 < 10000. Since we need to ensure that the sample size is sufficient regardless of the actual variance (as long as it's less than 10000), I think we should use œÉ^2 = 10000 for our calculations to get the maximum required sample size.So, œÉ^2 = 10000.Now, plugging these values into the sample size formula. Let me write down the formula again to make sure I have it right.n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2 * N) / ((N - 1) * E^2 + Z^2 * œÉ^2)Wait, is that correct? I think I might have confused it with another formula. Let me think again.I think the correct formula for a finite population is:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / (E^2 + (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / N)Yes, that seems more familiar. So, it's the same as the simple random sample formula adjusted by the finite population correction factor.So, let's write that down:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / (E^2 + (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / N)Plugging in the numbers:Z = 2.33œÉ^2 = 10000E = 15N = 5000So,n = (2.33^2 * 10000) / (15^2 + (2.33^2 * 10000) / 5000)Let me calculate each part step by step.First, calculate Z^2:2.33^2 = 5.4289Then, multiply by œÉ^2:5.4289 * 10000 = 54289Now, calculate E^2:15^2 = 225Next, calculate (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / N:54289 / 5000 = 10.8578Now, add E^2 and this value:225 + 10.8578 = 235.8578So, the denominator is 235.8578.Now, the numerator is 54289.So, n = 54289 / 235.8578Let me compute that:54289 √∑ 235.8578 ‚âà 230.2Since we can't have a fraction of a sample, we need to round up to the next whole number. So, n ‚âà 231.Wait, but I think in some cases, you might round down if the decimal is less than 0.5, but in sample size calculations, it's safer to round up to ensure the margin of error is met.But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Z = 2.33Z^2 = 5.4289œÉ^2 = 10000E = 15N = 5000n = (5.4289 * 10000) / (225 + (5.4289 * 10000)/5000)= 54289 / (225 + 10.8578)= 54289 / 235.8578‚âà 230.2Yes, that seems correct. So, rounding up, n = 231.But wait, I think I might have seen a different formula where the finite population correction is applied differently. Let me check that.Another formula I recall is:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / (E^2) * (N / (N - 1 + (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / E^2))Hmm, that looks a bit different. Let me try that.Plugging in the same values:Z^2 * œÉ^2 = 5.4289 * 10000 = 54289E^2 = 225N = 5000So,n = (54289 / 225) * (5000 / (5000 - 1 + 54289 / 225))= (241.3) * (5000 / (4999 + 241.3))= 241.3 * (5000 / 5240.3)‚âà 241.3 * 0.9543‚âà 230.3Again, rounding up, n ‚âà 231.Hmm, so both formulas give me approximately the same result, around 230.2 to 230.3, which rounds up to 231.But wait, in the first formula, I got 230.2, and in the second, 230.3. So, both suggest rounding up to 231.However, sometimes in sample size calculations, you might see the formula without the finite population correction, which would be:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / E^2Plugging in the numbers:n = (5.4289 * 10000) / 225= 54289 / 225‚âà 241.3So, without the finite population correction, you'd need a sample size of about 242.But since we have a finite population of 5000, we should use the finite population correction to adjust the sample size downward.So, using the finite population correction, we end up with a smaller sample size, around 231.But let me think about whether I should use 230 or 231. Since 230.2 is closer to 230, but in sample size calculations, you usually round up to ensure the margin of error is not exceeded. So, 231 would be the safer choice.But let me check if there's a standard practice for this. I think generally, you round up to the next whole number to ensure the sample size is sufficient.So, n = 231.But wait, let me double-check the finite population correction formula again to make sure I applied it correctly.The formula is:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / (E^2 + (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / N)Which we calculated as:n = 54289 / (225 + 10.8578) = 54289 / 235.8578 ‚âà 230.2Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, another way to write the finite population correction is:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2 * N) / (Z^2 * œÉ^2 + E^2 * (N - 1))Which would be:n = (5.4289 * 10000 * 5000) / (5.4289 * 10000 + 225 * 4999)Let's compute that.First, numerator:5.4289 * 10000 * 5000 = 5.4289 * 10000 * 5000 = 5.4289 * 50,000,000 = 271,445,000Denominator:5.4289 * 10000 + 225 * 4999 = 54,289 + 225 * 4999Calculate 225 * 4999:225 * 5000 = 1,125,000Subtract 225:1,125,000 - 225 = 1,124,775So, denominator = 54,289 + 1,124,775 = 1,179,064Now, n = 271,445,000 / 1,179,064 ‚âà 230.2Again, same result.So, n ‚âà 230.2, which rounds up to 231.But wait, in some sources, they might use a slightly different formula, like:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / (E^2) * (1 / (1 + (n - 1)/N))But that seems recursive because n is on both sides. So, that might not be the right approach.Alternatively, I think the formula I used earlier is correct.So, to summarize, using the finite population correction, the required sample size is approximately 230.2, which we round up to 231.But let me think about whether 231 is the exact answer or if there's a more precise way to calculate it.Alternatively, maybe I should use the t-distribution instead of the Z-distribution because the population variance is estimated from the sample. But in this case, we're given that the population variance is less than 10000, so maybe we can treat it as known and use the Z-distribution.But actually, since we're dealing with a finite population and the variance is given as less than 10000, I think using the Z-distribution is acceptable.Wait, but if the population variance is known, we can use the Z-distribution. If it's unknown and estimated from the sample, we'd use the t-distribution. Since here, we're given that the population variance is less than 10000, but we don't know the exact value, so maybe we should use the t-distribution with degrees of freedom based on the sample size.But that complicates things because the degrees of freedom depend on the sample size, which is what we're trying to find. So, perhaps it's better to use the Z-distribution for simplicity, especially since the sample size is likely to be large enough that the t-distribution and Z-distribution are similar.So, sticking with Z = 2.33.Therefore, my conclusion is that the required sample size is approximately 231.But wait, let me check if there's a standard formula or table that gives a different answer. Maybe I should look up the sample size formula for a finite population.Upon checking, I find that the formula is indeed:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2 * N) / (Z^2 * œÉ^2 + E^2 * (N - 1))Which is what I used earlier, giving n ‚âà 230.2.So, rounding up, n = 231.But some sources might suggest using the simpler formula without the finite population correction if the sample size is less than 5% of the population. In this case, 231 is about 4.6% of 5000, which is close to 5%. So, some might argue that the finite population correction isn't necessary, and you can use the simpler formula:n = (Z^2 * œÉ^2) / E^2Which gives n ‚âà 241.3, so 242.But since 231 is less than 242, and we're dealing with a finite population, I think it's better to use the finite population correction to get a more accurate sample size.Therefore, I think the correct sample size is 231.But wait, let me think again. If I use n = 231, what is the actual margin of error?Using the finite population formula, the margin of error E is given by:E = Z * œÉ * sqrt((N - n)/(N * n))Plugging in the values:Z = 2.33œÉ = sqrt(10000) = 100N = 5000n = 231So,E = 2.33 * 100 * sqrt((5000 - 231)/(5000 * 231))= 233 * sqrt(4769 / 1,153,310)= 233 * sqrt(0.004136)‚âà 233 * 0.0643‚âà 15.0So, the margin of error is approximately 15 hours, which is exactly what we wanted.Therefore, n = 231 gives us the desired margin of error.But wait, if I use n = 230, what happens?E = 2.33 * 100 * sqrt((5000 - 230)/(5000 * 230))= 233 * sqrt(4770 / 1,150,000)= 233 * sqrt(0.004148)‚âà 233 * 0.06436‚âà 15.0So, even with n = 230, the margin of error is still approximately 15 hours.Therefore, both n = 230 and n = 231 give us a margin of error close to 15 hours.But since n must be an integer, and we want to ensure that the margin of error does not exceed 15 hours, we should choose the larger sample size, which is 231, to be safe.However, in practice, sometimes you might see people rounding down if the decimal is less than 0.5, but in sample size calculations, it's generally better to round up to ensure the desired precision.Therefore, the required sample size is 231.But wait, let me check if there's a more precise way to calculate this without approximating.Alternatively, we can set up the equation for the margin of error and solve for n.The margin of error for a finite population is:E = Z * œÉ * sqrt((N - n)/(N * n))We want E ‚â§ 15.So,15 ‚â• 2.33 * 100 * sqrt((5000 - n)/(5000 * n))Divide both sides by 2.33 * 100:15 / (2.33 * 100) ‚â• sqrt((5000 - n)/(5000 * n))Calculate 15 / (2.33 * 100):15 / 233 ‚âà 0.064378So,0.064378 ‚â• sqrt((5000 - n)/(5000 * n))Square both sides:(0.064378)^2 ‚â• (5000 - n)/(5000 * n)Calculate (0.064378)^2 ‚âà 0.004143So,0.004143 ‚â• (5000 - n)/(5000 * n)Multiply both sides by 5000 * n:0.004143 * 5000 * n ‚â• 5000 - nCalculate 0.004143 * 5000 ‚âà 20.715So,20.715 * n ‚â• 5000 - nBring all terms to one side:20.715n + n ‚â• 500021.715n ‚â• 5000Divide both sides by 21.715:n ‚â• 5000 / 21.715 ‚âà 230.2So, n ‚â• 230.2Therefore, n must be at least 231.So, this confirms our earlier calculation.Therefore, the required sample size is 231.But wait, in the initial calculation, we got n ‚âà 230.2, which rounds up to 231. So, that's consistent.Therefore, the final answer is 231.But let me just think if there's any other factor I might have missed.We assumed that the population variance is exactly 10000, but the problem states it's less than 10000. So, if the actual variance is less than 10000, the required sample size would be smaller. However, since we need to ensure the condition for any variance less than 10000, we should use the maximum variance (10000) to calculate the sample size, ensuring that the sample size is sufficient regardless of the actual variance.Therefore, using œÉ^2 = 10000 is correct.Also, we used the Z-score for a 98.02% confidence level, which is approximately 2.33. I think that's correct because for a 98% confidence level, the Z-score is around 2.33.Wait, actually, let me double-check the Z-score for a 98.02% confidence level.The confidence level is 0.9802, which means the tails are (1 - 0.9802)/2 = 0.0099 on each side.Looking up the Z-score for 0.99 cumulative probability (since 1 - 0.0099 = 0.9901), the Z-score is approximately 2.33.Yes, that's correct.Therefore, all the components of the calculation seem correct.So, in conclusion, the required sample size is 231."},{"question":"A circle has an area of Mtext{ cm}^2 and a circumference of Ntext{ cm}. If dfrac{M}{N}=15, what is the radius of the circle, in cm?","answer":"First, I recognize that the problem involves a circle with a given ratio of its area to its circumference. I'll start by recalling the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle in terms of its radius.The area ( M ) of a circle is given by the formula:[M = pi r^2]where ( r ) is the radius of the circle.The circumference ( N ) of a circle is given by:[N = 2pi r]According to the problem, the ratio of the area to the circumference is 15:[frac{M}{N} = 15]Substituting the expressions for ( M ) and ( N ) into this ratio:[frac{pi r^2}{2pi r} = 15]Simplifying the equation by canceling out ( pi ) and one ( r ):[frac{r}{2} = 15]Finally, solving for ( r ) by multiplying both sides by 2:[r = 30]Therefore, the radius of the circle is 30 centimeters."},{"question":"Given that the complex number z is a root of the quadratic equation x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0, find the value of |z| ( )A: 1B: sqrt {2}C: 0D: 2","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that the complex number ( z ) is a root of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0 ), find the value of ( |z| ). The options are A: 1, B: ( sqrt{2} ), C: 0, D: 2.Hmm, I remember that for quadratic equations, if the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex numbers. Let me check the discriminant first. The discriminant ( D ) is given by ( D = b^2 - 4ac ). In this equation, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -2 ), and ( c = 2 ). So, ( D = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4 ). Since the discriminant is negative, the roots are indeed complex numbers. That makes sense.Now, to find the roots, I can use the quadratic formula: ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{D}}{2a} ). Plugging in the values, we get ( x = frac{2 pm sqrt{-4}}{2} ). Simplifying that, ( sqrt{-4} = 2i ), so the roots are ( x = frac{2 pm 2i}{2} ). Dividing numerator and denominator by 2, we get ( x = 1 pm i ). So, the roots are ( 1 + i ) and ( 1 - i ).Now, I need to find the modulus of ( z ), which is ( |z| ). The modulus of a complex number ( a + bi ) is given by ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). For ( z = 1 + i ), ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 1 ). So, ( |z| = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2} ). Similarly, for ( z = 1 - i ), the modulus is the same because the square of ( -1 ) is still 1. So, ( |z| = sqrt{2} ) in both cases.Looking back at the options, ( sqrt{2} ) is option B. So, the answer should be B.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I calculated the discriminant correctly: ( (-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4 ). That's right. Then, using the quadratic formula, I substituted correctly and simplified to get ( 1 pm i ). Calculating the modulus, I squared both the real and imaginary parts, added them, and took the square root. That all seems correct. So, I think my answer is right.I wonder if there's another way to find the modulus without finding the roots explicitly. Maybe using properties of quadratic equations? Let me think. For a quadratic equation ( x^2 + px + q = 0 ), the product of the roots is ( q ). In this case, the equation is ( x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0 ), so the product of the roots is 2. If the roots are complex conjugates, their product is equal to the square of their modulus. So, ( |z|^2 = 2 ), which means ( |z| = sqrt{2} ). That's another way to see it without calculating the roots. That confirms my earlier result.Yeah, that makes sense. So, whether I calculate the modulus directly from the roots or use the property of the product of roots, I get the same answer. I'm pretty confident now that the correct answer is B: ( sqrt{2} ).**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Which of the following statements are true?(1) A quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel and the other pair of opposite sides equal is a parallelogram.(2) A quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel and one pair of opposite angles equal is a parallelogram.(3) A quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides equal and one pair of opposite angles equal is a parallelogram.(4) A quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite angles equal is a parallelogram.The correct statements are(A) (2), (3)(B) (2), (4)(C) (1), (3)(D) (3), (4)","answer":"Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here about quadrilaterals and parallelograms. There are four statements, and I need to figure out which ones are true. The options are (1), (2), (3), and (4), and the answer choices are combinations of these. Let me take it step by step.First, I need to remember the properties of a parallelogram. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel. Additionally, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length, and opposite angles are equal. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. These properties might help me evaluate the given statements.Let's look at each statement one by one.**Statement (1):** A quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel and the other pair of opposite sides equal is a parallelogram.Hmm, okay. So, if I have a quadrilateral where one pair of sides is parallel, say sides AB and CD are parallel, and the other pair of sides, say AD and BC, are equal in length. Does that make it a parallelogram?I think about the definition of a parallelogram. It requires both pairs of opposite sides to be parallel. Here, only one pair is given as parallel. The other pair is equal but not necessarily parallel. So, is this enough?Wait, maybe I can draw a picture in my mind. If AB is parallel to CD, and AD equals BC, but AD and BC are not necessarily parallel. So, it might not be a parallelogram. Maybe it's some kind of trapezoid instead?Yes, a trapezoid has one pair of sides parallel, and the other pair can be unequal or equal. So, if the other pair is equal, it's called an isosceles trapezoid. But an isosceles trapezoid is not a parallelogram because only one pair of sides is parallel.Therefore, statement (1) is not necessarily true. So, I can eliminate any answer choices that include statement (1).**Statement (2):** A quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel and one pair of opposite angles equal is a parallelogram.Alright, so here, one pair of sides is parallel, say AB parallel to CD, and one pair of angles is equal, say angle A equals angle C.I need to see if this makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram. Let me think about the properties.If AB is parallel to CD, then consecutive angles should be supplementary. That is, angle A + angle D = 180 degrees, and angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.Given that angle A equals angle C, let's denote angle A = angle C = x. Then, angle D would be 180 - x, and angle B would be 180 - x as well because angle B + angle C = 180.So, angle B = angle D = 180 - x.Therefore, both pairs of opposite angles are equal. Wait, that's one of the properties of a parallelogram. If both pairs of opposite angles are equal, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.But in this statement, it only says one pair of opposite angles is equal. However, from that, we can deduce that the other pair must also be equal because of the parallel sides.So, actually, if one pair of opposite angles is equal in a quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel, then it must be a parallelogram.Therefore, statement (2) is true.**Statement (3):** A quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides equal and one pair of opposite angles equal is a parallelogram.Okay, so here, one pair of sides is equal, say AB = CD, and one pair of angles is equal, say angle A = angle C.Does this make the quadrilateral a parallelogram?I'm not sure. Let me think. If AB = CD and angle A = angle C, does that necessarily mean that the other sides are parallel or the other angles are equal?I think not necessarily. Maybe it's possible to have such a quadrilateral that isn't a parallelogram.For example, imagine a kite where two pairs of adjacent sides are equal, but it's not a parallelogram. But in this case, it's one pair of opposite sides equal and one pair of opposite angles equal.Wait, maybe I can sketch this mentally. If AB = CD and angle A = angle C, but sides AD and BC are not necessarily equal or parallel.Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I can use the Law of Sines or something?If I consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD, but I'm not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe it's not sufficient to conclude it's a parallelogram. So, perhaps statement (3) is not necessarily true.**Statement (4):** A quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite angles equal is a parallelogram.Okay, this seems familiar. If both pairs of opposite angles are equal, then it's a parallelogram.Yes, that's one of the standard properties. If in a quadrilateral, both pairs of opposite angles are equal, then it must be a parallelogram.So, statement (4) is true.So, summarizing:- Statement (1): False- Statement (2): True- Statement (3): False- Statement (4): TrueTherefore, the correct statements are (2) and (4), which corresponds to option (B).Wait, but I want to double-check statement (3). Maybe I was too quick to dismiss it.Statement (3): One pair of opposite sides equal and one pair of opposite angles equal.Is there a case where this could be a parallelogram? Well, if both pairs of opposite sides are equal and both pairs of opposite angles are equal, then it's a parallelogram. But here, only one pair of sides and one pair of angles are equal.I think it's possible to have a quadrilateral where AB = CD and angle A = angle C, but the other sides are not equal and the other angles are not equal, hence not a parallelogram.For example, imagine a quadrilateral where AB = CD, angle A = angle C, but AD is not equal to BC, and angle B is not equal to angle D.So, yeah, statement (3) is not necessarily true.Therefore, my conclusion remains that statements (2) and (4) are true, so the answer is (B)."},{"question":"On a circle, points A, B, C, D, E, F, G are arranged clockwise, as shown in the diagram. It is known that AE is the diameter of the circle. Additionally, it is known that angle ABF = 81^circ and angle EDG = 76^circ. How many degrees is angle FCG?","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here with points A, B, C, D, E, F, G arranged clockwise on a circle. It says that AE is the diameter, and we're given two angles: angle ABF is 81 degrees, and angle EDG is 76 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle FCG. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, since AE is the diameter, that means points A and E are directly opposite each other on the circle. So, the circle is divided into two equal halves by AE. That also means that any triangle inscribed in the circle with AE as one of its sides will be a right-angled triangle because of Thales' theorem. So, if I consider triangle ACE, it should be a right-angled triangle with the right angle at point C. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If AE is the diameter, then any point C on the circle will form a right angle at C when connected to A and E. So, yes, angle ACE is 90 degrees.Now, we have angle ABF which is 81 degrees. Point B is between A and C, I assume, since the points are arranged clockwise as A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So, angle ABF is at point B, between points A, B, and F. Similarly, angle EDG is 76 degrees, which is at point D, between points E, D, and G.I need to find angle FCG. That's the angle at point C between points F, C, and G. Hmm, okay. Maybe I can use some properties of circles and inscribed angles here. Let me recall that inscribed angles subtended by the same arc are equal. So, if two angles are subtended by the same arc, they should be equal.Looking at angle ABF, which is 81 degrees. This angle is subtended by the arc AF. So, arc AF must correspond to an angle of 81 degrees at the circumference. Similarly, angle EDG is 76 degrees, subtended by arc EG. So, arc EG is 76 degrees.Wait, but how does that help me with angle FCG? Let me think about the position of point C. Since AE is the diameter, and points are arranged clockwise, point C is somewhere between A and E. So, point C is on one side of the diameter, and points F and G are on the other side, right? Because after E, we have F and G.So, angle FCG is formed by points F, C, and G. Since C is on the circumference, angle FCG is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc. So, if I can find the measure of arc FG, then angle FCG would be half of that.But wait, how do I find arc FG? Let me see. If I can find the measures of arcs AF and EG, maybe I can figure out the rest of the circle. The entire circle is 360 degrees. We know that arc AE is the diameter, so it's 180 degrees. Then, the remaining arcs from E back to A would also sum up to 180 degrees.But we have points F and G between E and A. So, from E, going clockwise, we have F, G, and then back to A. So, the arcs EF, FG, and GA make up the other half of the circle, which is 180 degrees.We know angle ABF is 81 degrees, which is subtended by arc AF. So, arc AF is 81 degrees. Similarly, angle EDG is 76 degrees, subtended by arc EG, so arc EG is 76 degrees.Wait, but arc AF is from A to F. Since A is one end of the diameter, and F is somewhere on the circle, arc AF is 81 degrees. Similarly, arc EG is from E to G, which is 76 degrees.But how does this help me find arc FG? Let me try to break down the circle into arcs.Starting from A, going clockwise, we have points B, C, D, E, F, G, and back to A. So, the circle is divided into arcs AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, and GA.We know that arc AF is 81 degrees. Arc AF would be the sum of arcs AB, BC, and CD, right? Because from A to F, passing through B, C, D. Similarly, arc EG is 76 degrees, which is the sum of arcs ED and DG, but wait, arc EG is from E to G, so that would be arcs EF and FG? Hmm, no, because from E, the next point is F, then G. So, arc EG is from E to G, which is EF + FG.Wait, no, because from E, going clockwise, the next point is F, then G. So, arc EG is actually EF + FG. But we were told that angle EDG is 76 degrees, which is subtended by arc EG. So, arc EG is 76 degrees. Therefore, arc EF + FG = 76 degrees.Similarly, angle ABF is 81 degrees, subtended by arc AF. Arc AF is from A to F, which is AB + BC + CD. So, arc AF = AB + BC + CD = 81 degrees.But we don't know the individual measures of AB, BC, or CD. Hmm, maybe I need another approach.Since AE is the diameter, and angle ACE is 90 degrees, as we established earlier. So, triangle ACE is right-angled at C. Now, if I can find some other angles or arcs related to point C, maybe I can find angle FCG.Wait, angle FCG is at point C, between points F and G. So, it's an inscribed angle subtended by arc FG. Therefore, angle FCG is half the measure of arc FG. So, if I can find arc FG, then angle FCG is half of that.So, how do I find arc FG? Let's see. From earlier, we know that arc EG is 76 degrees, which is EF + FG. So, arc EF + FG = 76 degrees.Also, arc AF is 81 degrees, which is AB + BC + CD.But we need more information to find arc FG. Maybe we can use the fact that the total circumference is 360 degrees. Let's see.The entire circle is 360 degrees. The diameter AE divides it into two semicircles, each 180 degrees. So, the arcs from A to E is 180 degrees, and from E back to A is also 180 degrees.From E back to A, we have points F, G, and then A. So, the arcs EF, FG, and GA sum up to 180 degrees.We know that arc EG is 76 degrees, which is EF + FG. So, EF + FG = 76 degrees.Therefore, GA = 180 - (EF + FG) = 180 - 76 = 104 degrees.So, arc GA is 104 degrees.Now, arc GA is from G to A, which is the same as arc AG. So, arc AG is 104 degrees.But arc AG is also equal to arc AF + FG, right? Because from A to G, you can go through F or through the other points. Wait, no, arc AG is directly from A to G, which is the same as arc AF + FG.Wait, no, because from A to G, going clockwise, it's AF + FG. But we already have arc AF as 81 degrees, and arc FG is what we're trying to find.But arc AG is 104 degrees, so AF + FG = 104 degrees.But AF is 81 degrees, so FG = 104 - 81 = 23 degrees.Wait, that can't be right because earlier we had arc EG = EF + FG = 76 degrees, and if FG is 23 degrees, then EF would be 76 - 23 = 53 degrees.But then, arc GA is 104 degrees, which is FG + GA? Wait, no, arc GA is 104 degrees, which is from G to A, which is the same as arc FG + GA? Wait, I'm getting confused.Let me try to write down all the arcs:Total circle: 360 degrees.Arc AE: 180 degrees (diameter).Arcs from E to A: EF + FG + GA = 180 degrees.We know arc EG = EF + FG = 76 degrees.Therefore, GA = 180 - 76 = 104 degrees.So, arc GA is 104 degrees.Now, arc AF is 81 degrees, which is from A to F.Arc AF is equal to arc AB + arc BC + arc CD.But we don't know these individual arcs.However, arc AF is 81 degrees, and arc GA is 104 degrees.Wait, arc AF is from A to F, and arc GA is from G to A. So, arc AF + arc FG + arc GA would be the whole circle? No, because arc AF is from A to F, arc FG is from F to G, and arc GA is from G to A. So, AF + FG + GA = 360 degrees? Wait, no, because AF + FG + GA would be going from A to F to G to A, which is the entire circle. So, AF + FG + GA = 360 degrees.But we know AF is 81 degrees, GA is 104 degrees, so FG = 360 - 81 - 104 = 175 degrees. Wait, that can't be right because earlier we had arc EG = EF + FG = 76 degrees, which would mean FG is 76 - EF, but EF would have to be negative if FG is 175, which doesn't make sense.I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify.Arc AF is 81 degrees, which is from A to F. Arc GA is 104 degrees, which is from G to A. So, the arc from F to G is the remaining part of the circle not covered by AF and GA.But the circle is 360 degrees, so arc FG = 360 - AF - GA = 360 - 81 - 104 = 175 degrees. But that contradicts the earlier statement that arc EG = 76 degrees, which is EF + FG.Wait, arc EG is from E to G, which is EF + FG. So, if arc EG is 76 degrees, and arc FG is 175 degrees, then EF would be 76 - 175 = negative 99 degrees, which is impossible.So, clearly, I'm misunderstanding something here.Let me try a different approach. Since angle ABF is 81 degrees, which is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AF. Therefore, arc AF is 2 * 81 = 162 degrees? Wait, no, inscribed angles are half the measure of their subtended arcs. So, if angle ABF is 81 degrees, then arc AF is 2 * 81 = 162 degrees.Wait, that makes more sense. So, arc AF is 162 degrees, not 81 degrees. I think I confused the angle with the arc measure earlier.Similarly, angle EDG is 76 degrees, which is an inscribed angle subtended by arc EG. Therefore, arc EG is 2 * 76 = 152 degrees.Okay, so let's correct that.Arc AF = 162 degrees.Arc EG = 152 degrees.Now, arc AF is from A to F, which is 162 degrees.Arc EG is from E to G, which is 152 degrees.Since AE is the diameter, arc AE is 180 degrees.Now, let's consider the circle divided into two semicircles: one from A to E (180 degrees) and the other from E back to A (another 180 degrees).From E back to A, we have points F, G, and then A. So, the arcs EF, FG, and GA sum up to 180 degrees.We know that arc EG is 152 degrees, which is EF + FG. So, EF + FG = 152 degrees.Therefore, GA = 180 - (EF + FG) = 180 - 152 = 28 degrees.So, arc GA is 28 degrees.Now, arc AF is 162 degrees, which is from A to F. So, arc AF = 162 degrees.But arc AF is also equal to arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DE + arc EF? Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, from A to F, going clockwise, we pass through B, C, D, E, and then F. So, arc AF is the sum of arcs AB + BC + CD + DE + EF.But we know that arc AF is 162 degrees, and arc EF is part of that.But we also know that arc EF + FG = 152 degrees, and arc GA = 28 degrees.Wait, maybe I can find arc EF.Since arc AF = 162 degrees, and arc AF is AB + BC + CD + DE + EF.But arc DE is part of the diameter side. Since AE is the diameter, arc AE is 180 degrees, which is arc AB + BC + CD + DE.So, arc AB + BC + CD + DE = 180 degrees.Therefore, arc AF = (AB + BC + CD + DE) + EF = 180 + EF = 162 degrees.Wait, that would mean 180 + EF = 162, which implies EF = -18 degrees, which is impossible.Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.Wait, no, arc AF is from A to F, which is on the other side of the diameter. So, maybe arc AF is not AB + BC + CD + DE + EF, but rather the shorter arc from A to F.Wait, but in a circle, the shorter arc between two points is the smaller of the two possible arcs. Since AF is 162 degrees, which is more than 180 degrees, that can't be the shorter arc. So, maybe arc AF is actually the shorter arc, which would be 360 - 162 = 198 degrees? No, that doesn't make sense because inscribed angles are based on the subtended arcs, which can be major or minor arcs.Wait, maybe I need to clarify. When we say an inscribed angle subtends an arc, it can be either the minor arc or the major arc, depending on the angle. If the angle is less than 180 degrees, it subtends the minor arc, and if it's more than 180, it subtends the major arc.But in this case, angle ABF is 81 degrees, which is less than 180, so it subtends the minor arc AF, which is 162 degrees.Similarly, angle EDG is 76 degrees, subtending minor arc EG of 152 degrees.So, arc AF is 162 degrees, which is the minor arc from A to F.Similarly, arc EG is 152 degrees, minor arc from E to G.Now, since AE is the diameter, arc AE is 180 degrees.So, from A to E is 180 degrees, and from E back to A is another 180 degrees.From E back to A, we have points F, G, and then A. So, arc EF + FG + GA = 180 degrees.We know that arc EG = EF + FG = 152 degrees.Therefore, GA = 180 - 152 = 28 degrees.So, arc GA is 28 degrees.Now, arc AF is 162 degrees, which is from A to F.But arc AF is also equal to arc AB + BC + CD + DE + EF.Wait, but arc AB + BC + CD + DE is the diameter, which is 180 degrees.So, arc AF = (AB + BC + CD + DE) + EF = 180 + EF = 162 degrees.Wait, that would mean EF = 162 - 180 = -18 degrees, which is impossible.Hmm, that can't be right. So, maybe my assumption that arc AF is the sum of AB + BC + CD + DE + EF is incorrect.Wait, perhaps arc AF is the shorter arc from A to F, which would be the other way around the circle, not passing through E.But since AE is the diameter, the circle is divided into two halves. So, from A, going clockwise, we have B, C, D, E, F, G, and back to A. So, the shorter arc from A to F would be going through B, C, D, E, which is 180 + EF? Wait, no.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to draw the circle mentally.Points are arranged clockwise: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.AE is the diameter, so A and E are opposite each other.So, from A, going clockwise, we have B, C, D, E, F, G, and back to A.So, the circle is divided into two semicircles: one from A to E (180 degrees) and the other from E back to A (another 180 degrees).Arc AF is from A to F, which is on the E side. So, arc AF is from A, passing through B, C, D, E, and then to F. So, that's more than 180 degrees, which would make it a major arc.But earlier, we said that angle ABF is 81 degrees, which is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AF. Since angle ABF is less than 180 degrees, it should subtend the minor arc AF, which would be the shorter arc from A to F.But in this case, the shorter arc from A to F would be the other way around the circle, not passing through E. So, that would be from A, going counterclockwise through G, F, and then to A. Wait, but that's not possible because the points are arranged clockwise.Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the direction.Let me clarify: in a circle, the minor arc between two points is the smaller of the two possible arcs. So, if the points are arranged clockwise as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, then the minor arc from A to F would be the shorter path, which is from A through G, F, which is less than 180 degrees.But wait, that would mean arc AF is actually the minor arc going the other way, which is shorter. So, if angle ABF is 81 degrees, it's subtended by the minor arc AF, which is the shorter arc from A to F, which is through G.So, arc AF (minor) is 81 * 2 = 162 degrees.But wait, that would mean that the major arc AF is 360 - 162 = 198 degrees.But in the circle, from A to F through E is 162 degrees? Wait, no, because from A to E is 180 degrees, and from E to F is some arc.Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to approach this differently.Since AE is the diameter, any triangle inscribed with AE as a side will have a right angle at the third point. So, triangle ACE is right-angled at C.Similarly, triangle AFE is right-angled at F, but wait, F is not necessarily forming a right angle unless it's on the circle with AE as diameter.Wait, no, only points on the circle with AE as diameter will form right angles. So, points B, C, D, E, F, G are all on the circle, so any triangle with AE as a side and another point on the circle will be right-angled at that point.So, triangle AFE is right-angled at F, triangle ABE is right-angled at B, etc.Wait, but in our case, angle ABF is 81 degrees. So, point F is somewhere on the circle such that when connected to A and B, forms an angle of 81 degrees at B.Similarly, angle EDG is 76 degrees, so point G is such that when connected to E and D, forms an angle of 76 degrees at D.I think I need to use the property that inscribed angles subtended by the same arc are equal.So, angle ABF is 81 degrees, which is subtended by arc AF. Therefore, any other angle subtended by arc AF will also be 81 degrees.Similarly, angle EDG is 76 degrees, subtended by arc EG, so any other angle subtended by arc EG will be 76 degrees.Now, angle FCG is subtended by arc FG. So, if I can find the measure of arc FG, then angle FCG will be half of that.So, how do I find arc FG?We know that arc AF is 162 degrees (since angle ABF is 81 degrees, which is half of 162).Similarly, arc EG is 152 degrees (since angle EDG is 76 degrees, half of 152).Now, let's consider the circle. The total circumference is 360 degrees.We have arc AF = 162 degrees, arc EG = 152 degrees.But these arcs overlap? Wait, no, arc AF is from A to F, and arc EG is from E to G.Since AE is the diameter, arc AE is 180 degrees.So, from A to E is 180 degrees, and from E back to A is another 180 degrees.From E back to A, we have points F, G, and then A.So, the arcs from E to F, F to G, and G to A sum up to 180 degrees.We know that arc EG is 152 degrees, which is from E to G, so that's EF + FG = 152 degrees.Therefore, arc GA = 180 - 152 = 28 degrees.So, arc GA is 28 degrees.Now, arc AF is 162 degrees, which is from A to F.But arc AF can also be considered as arc AG + arc GF.Wait, no, arc AF is from A to F, which is the same as arc AG + arc GF.But arc AG is 28 degrees, so arc GF would be arc AF - arc AG = 162 - 28 = 134 degrees.Wait, but arc GF is the same as arc FG, right? Because from G to F is the same as from F to G, just in the opposite direction.But in terms of measure, arc FG is the same as arc GF, just the direction is different.So, arc FG is 134 degrees.Wait, but earlier we had arc EG = EF + FG = 152 degrees.If arc FG is 134 degrees, then arc EF = 152 - 134 = 18 degrees.So, arc EF is 18 degrees.Now, let's check if this makes sense.From E back to A, we have arc EF = 18 degrees, arc FG = 134 degrees, and arc GA = 28 degrees. So, 18 + 134 + 28 = 180 degrees, which matches.Also, arc AF is 162 degrees, which is arc AG + arc GF = 28 + 134 = 162 degrees, which is correct.So, now, arc FG is 134 degrees.Therefore, angle FCG, which is subtended by arc FG, is half of 134 degrees.So, angle FCG = 134 / 2 = 67 degrees.Therefore, the measure of angle FCG is 67 degrees."},{"question":"Mary can mow a lawn in three hours, whereas Tom can mow the same lawn in four hours. Tom starts mowing the lawn and works alone for 1 hour before Mary joins him. Together, they mow for another 2 hours. How much of the lawn remains to be mowed?","answer":"First, I need to determine the individual mowing rates of Mary and Tom. Mary can mow a lawn in 3 hours, so her mowing rate is 1/3 of the lawn per hour. Tom can mow the same lawn in 4 hours, so his mowing rate is 1/4 of the lawn per hour.Tom starts mowing the lawn alone for 1 hour. During this time, he mows 1/4 of the lawn.Next, Mary joins Tom, and they work together for another 2 hours. Their combined mowing rate is the sum of their individual rates: 1/3 + 1/4. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator, which is 12. So, 1/3 becomes 4/12 and 1/4 becomes 3/12. Adding these together gives 7/12 of the lawn per hour.Over 2 hours, they mow 7/12 multiplied by 2, which equals 14/12 or 7/6 of the lawn. However, since they are working on the same lawn, the total mowed area cannot exceed 1 lawn. Therefore, the total mowed area is capped at 1 lawn.Finally, to find out how much of the lawn remains to be mowed, I subtract the total mowed area from the entire lawn: 1 - 1 = 0. This means the entire lawn has been mowed, and no part of it remains."},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,m), overrightarrow{b}=(-1,1), overrightarrow{c}=(3,0), if overrightarrow{a} is parallel to (overrightarrow{b}+overrightarrow{c}), then m=underline{hspace{1cm}}A: -1B: frac{1}{2}C: 2D: -2","answer":"First, I need to find the vector resulting from adding vectors (overrightarrow{b}) and (overrightarrow{c}).

Hmm, oblique asymptotes happen when the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the degree of the denominator, right? Let me check: the numerator is a quadratic (degree 2) and the denominator is linear (degree 1). Yep, that fits. So, I should be able to find an oblique asymptote here.I remember that to find the oblique asymptote, I need to perform polynomial long division. That means dividing the numerator by the denominator and seeing what the quotient is, because that quotient will be the equation of the asymptote. The remainder will just become a fraction that goes to zero as x approaches infinity, so it doesn't affect the asymptote.Alright, let's set up the division. The numerator is 3x¬≤ + 8x + 5, and the denominator is x + 4. I need to divide 3x¬≤ + 8x + 5 by x + 4.First, I'll divide the leading term of the numerator, which is 3x¬≤, by the leading term of the denominator, which is x. So, 3x¬≤ divided by x is 3x. That's the first term of the quotient.Next, I'll multiply the entire denominator (x + 4) by this term (3x), giving me 3x¬≤ + 12x. Now, I'll subtract this from the original numerator:(3x¬≤ + 8x + 5) - (3x¬≤ + 12x) = (0x¬≤) + (-4x) + 5.So, after the first step, I have -4x + 5 remaining. Now, I'll repeat the process. I take the leading term of the new polynomial, which is -4x, and divide it by the leading term of the denominator, x, giving me -4. That's the next term in the quotient.Then, I multiply the denominator by -4, resulting in -4x - 16. Subtracting this from the current polynomial:(-4x + 5) - (-4x - 16) = 0x + 21.So, now I have a remainder of 21. Since the degree of the remainder (which is 0, because it's a constant) is less than the degree of the denominator (which is 1), I can't continue the division further.Putting it all together, the result of the division is 3x - 4 with a remainder of 21/(x + 4). So, the original function can be written as:(3x¬≤ + 8x + 5)/(x + 4) = 3x - 4 + 21/(x + 4).As x approaches infinity, the term 21/(x + 4) becomes negligible because the denominator grows without bound, making the whole fraction approach zero. Therefore, the function behaves more and more like the linear function 3x - 4.So, the oblique asymptote is the line y = 3x - 4.Wait, let me double-check my division to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 3x¬≤ + 8x + 5 divided by x + 4.First term: 3x¬≤ / x = 3x. Multiply back: 3x*(x + 4) = 3x¬≤ + 12x. Subtract: (3x¬≤ + 8x) - (3x¬≤ + 12x) = -4x. Bring down the +5: -4x + 5.Next term: -4x / x = -4. Multiply back: -4*(x + 4) = -4x -16. Subtract: (-4x + 5) - (-4x -16) = 21. Yep, that's correct.So, the division is accurate, and the remainder is 21. Therefore, the asymptote is indeed y = 3x - 4.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my steps, so I'm confident that the oblique asymptote is y = 3x - 4."},{"question":"Given a natural number ( n ) greater than 1. Let ( a, b, c, d ) be natural numbers satisfyingfrac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d} < 1, quad a + c leqslant n,find the maximum value of ( frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d} ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d}) given that (a, b, c, d) are natural numbers, (a + c leq n), and (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d} < 1). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I know that (a, b, c, d) are all natural numbers, which means they are positive integers. The constraints are that the sum of (a) and (c) is at most (n), and the sum of the fractions (frac{a}{b}) and (frac{c}{d}) is less than 1. I need to maximize this sum.Let me think about how to approach this. Since I want to maximize (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d}), I should try to make both fractions as large as possible without their sum exceeding 1. That means I want (a) and (c) to be as large as possible relative to (b) and (d), respectively.Given that (a + c leq n), the maximum possible value for (a + c) is (n). So, maybe I can set (a + c = n) to maximize the numerators. That seems like a good starting point.Now, if (a + c = n), then I need to choose (a) and (c) such that (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d}) is as large as possible but still less than 1. To maximize each fraction, I should minimize (b) and (d). However, since (a) and (c) are fixed once (a + c = n), I need to find the smallest possible (b) and (d) such that (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d} < 1).Wait, but (b) and (d) are denominators, so smaller denominators make the fractions larger. But I can't just set (b = 1) and (d = 1) because then (frac{a}{1} + frac{c}{1} = a + c = n), which is definitely greater than 1 (since (n > 1)). So, I need to find a balance where (b) and (d) are just large enough to make the sum less than 1.Maybe I can approach this by fixing (a) and (c) first. Let's say (a = k) and (c = n - k) for some integer (k) between 1 and (n - 1). Then, I need to find (b) and (d) such that (frac{k}{b} + frac{n - k}{d} < 1).To maximize the sum, I should choose the smallest possible (b) and (d) such that the inequality holds. Let's try to find the minimal (b) and (d) for a given (k).Starting with (b), for a fixed (k), the smallest (b) can be is 2 because if (b = 1), then (frac{k}{1} = k), which is already greater than or equal to 1 (since (k geq 1)), making the sum exceed 1. So, (b) must be at least 2.Similarly, for (d), the smallest possible value is 2. However, if both (b) and (d) are 2, then (frac{k}{2} + frac{n - k}{2} = frac{n}{2}). For this to be less than 1, (n) must be less than 2, but (n > 1), so (n = 2) is the only possibility. But (n) is given as greater than 1, so for (n = 2), this would work. However, for larger (n), this approach won't hold.Therefore, for larger (n), I need to choose larger denominators. Maybe I can set (b) and (d) such that (frac{k}{b} + frac{n - k}{d}) is just less than 1. To do this, perhaps I can express (d) in terms of (b) or vice versa.Let me rearrange the inequality:[frac{k}{b} + frac{n - k}{d} < 1]Let's solve for (d):[frac{n - k}{d} < 1 - frac{k}{b}][d > frac{n - k}{1 - frac{k}{b}}]Similarly, solving for (b):[frac{k}{b} < 1 - frac{n - k}{d}][b > frac{k}{1 - frac{n - k}{d}}]Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can fix (b) and then find the minimal (d) that satisfies the inequality, or fix (d) and find the minimal (b). Let's try fixing (b) first.Suppose I fix (b = m), then I can solve for (d):[d > frac{n - k}{1 - frac{k}{m}}]Since (d) must be an integer, the minimal (d) is (leftlceil frac{n - k}{1 - frac{k}{m}} rightrceil + 1). Wait, why plus 1? Because if (frac{n - k}{1 - frac{k}{m}}) is an integer, then (d) must be greater than that, so we take the ceiling and add 1.But this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the case where (a = b - 1) and (c = d - 1). Then, (frac{a}{b} = frac{b - 1}{b}) and (frac{c}{d} = frac{d - 1}{d}). The sum would be (frac{b - 1}{b} + frac{d - 1}{d} = 1 - frac{1}{b} + 1 - frac{1}{d} = 2 - left(frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{d}right)). But this is greater than 1, which violates the condition. So, that approach doesn't work.Wait, maybe I need to have one fraction close to 1 and the other very small. For example, if (frac{a}{b}) is just less than 1, then (frac{c}{d}) can be as large as possible without making the total sum exceed 1. Alternatively, if both fractions are moderately sized.But how do I balance this? Maybe the maximum occurs when both fractions are as large as possible without their sum exceeding 1. That might happen when both fractions are just below 0.5 each, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one fraction is as large as possible, and the other is just small enough to keep the sum below 1. Let's explore this.Suppose I set (frac{a}{b}) to be just less than 1, say (frac{a}{b} = 1 - epsilon), where (epsilon) is a small positive number. Then, (frac{c}{d}) can be up to (epsilon). But since (a + c leq n), if (a) is close to (b), then (c) is small, so (frac{c}{d}) can be small.But I need to maximize the sum, so maybe it's better to have both fractions contribute significantly. Let me think about specific examples.Let's take (n = 2). Then (a + c leq 2). The possible pairs are (1,1) and (2,0), but since (c) must be at least 1 (as (d) is at least 1), the only possibility is (a = 1) and (c = 1). Then, we need to choose (b) and (d) such that (frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{d} < 1). The minimal (b) and (d) are 2, so (frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1), which is not less than 1. So, we need to choose (b = 2) and (d = 3), giving (frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} = frac{5}{6}), which is less than 1. Alternatively, (b = 3) and (d = 2), same result. So, the maximum is (frac{5}{6}).Wait, but is there a way to get higher? If (a = 2) and (c = 0), but (c) must be at least 1, so that's not allowed. So, for (n = 2), the maximum is (frac{5}{6}).Okay, moving on to (n = 3). Then (a + c) can be 3. Let's try different splits:1. (a = 1), (c = 2): Then, (frac{1}{b} + frac{2}{d} < 1). To maximize, set (b = 2), then (frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{d} < 1), so (frac{2}{d} < frac{1}{2}), which implies (d > 4). So, minimal (d = 5), giving (frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{5} = frac{9}{10}).2. (a = 2), (c = 1): Similar to above, (frac{2}{b} + frac{1}{d} < 1). Set (b = 3), then (frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{d} < 1), so (frac{1}{d} < frac{1}{3}), (d > 3), minimal (d = 4), giving (frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{4} = frac{11}{12}).3. (a = 3), (c = 0): Not allowed since (c geq 1).So, the maximum is (frac{11}{12}).Hmm, interesting. So, for (n = 2), the maximum is (frac{5}{6}), and for (n = 3), it's (frac{11}{12}). I notice that as (n) increases, the maximum sum seems to approach 1.Let me try (n = 4):1. (a = 1), (c = 3): (frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{d} < 1). So, (frac{3}{d} < frac{1}{2}), (d > 6), minimal (d = 7), sum is (frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{7} = frac{13}{14}).2. (a = 2), (c = 2): (frac{2}{b} + frac{2}{d} < 1). Let's set (b = 3), then (frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{d} < 1), so (frac{2}{d} < frac{1}{3}), (d > 6), minimal (d = 7), sum is (frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{7} = frac{20}{21}).3. (a = 3), (c = 1): Similar to (a = 2), (c = 1), but let's see: (frac{3}{b} + frac{1}{d} < 1). Set (b = 4), then (frac{3}{4} + frac{1}{d} < 1), so (frac{1}{d} < frac{1}{4}), (d > 4), minimal (d = 5), sum is (frac{3}{4} + frac{1}{5} = frac{19}{20}).Comparing the sums: (frac{13}{14} approx 0.9286), (frac{20}{21} approx 0.9524), (frac{19}{20} = 0.95). So, the maximum is (frac{20}{21}).Hmm, so for (n = 4), the maximum is (frac{20}{21}).I see a pattern here. For each (n), the maximum seems to be approaching 1 as (n) increases. But how exactly?Looking at the examples:- (n = 2): (frac{5}{6} = 1 - frac{1}{6})- (n = 3): (frac{11}{12} = 1 - frac{1}{12})- (n = 4): (frac{20}{21} = 1 - frac{1}{21})Wait, the denominators are 6, 12, 21. These numbers are 6 = 2*3, 12 = 3*4, 21 = 4*5. So, for (n = 2), it's 2*3, for (n = 3), it's 3*4, for (n = 4), it's 4*5. So, the denominator is (n(n+1)). Therefore, the maximum sum is (1 - frac{1}{n(n+1)}).Wait, let's check:For (n = 2): (1 - frac{1}{2*3} = 1 - frac{1}{6} = frac{5}{6}) ‚úîÔ∏èFor (n = 3): (1 - frac{1}{3*4} = 1 - frac{1}{12} = frac{11}{12}) ‚úîÔ∏èFor (n = 4): (1 - frac{1}{4*5} = 1 - frac{1}{20} = frac{19}{20}), but wait, earlier I got (frac{20}{21}) for (n = 4). Hmm, that doesn't match. So, my initial thought might be incorrect.Wait, for (n = 4), the maximum was (frac{20}{21}), which is (1 - frac{1}{21}), but according to the pattern, it should be (1 - frac{1}{20}). So, my pattern assumption is wrong.Alternatively, maybe the denominator is ( (n+1)(n+2)/2 ) or something else. Let me see:For (n = 2): 6 = 3*2For (n = 3): 12 = 4*3For (n = 4): 21 = 5*4.2? Wait, no, 21 is 5*4.2, which isn't an integer. Wait, 21 is 3*7, but that doesn't fit a clear pattern.Alternatively, maybe the denominator is ( (n+1)(n+2)/2 ):For (n = 2): (3)(4)/2 = 6 ‚úîÔ∏èFor (n = 3): (4)(5)/2 = 10, but we have 12, so no.Wait, maybe it's ( (n+1)(n+2) ):For (n = 2): 3*4 = 12, but we have 6.No, that doesn't fit.Alternatively, perhaps it's related to triangular numbers. The denominators are 6, 12, 21, which are 3rd, 4th, and 5th triangular numbers multiplied by 2? Wait, triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21,...6 is the 3rd triangular number, 12 is not a triangular number, 21 is the 6th triangular number. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe the denominator is ( (n+1)(n+2) ):For (n = 2): 3*4 = 12, but we have 6.Wait, perhaps it's ( (n+1)(n+2)/2 ):For (n = 2): 3*4/2 = 6 ‚úîÔ∏èFor (n = 3): 4*5/2 = 10, but we have 12.Hmm, no.Wait, maybe it's ( (n+1)(n+2) ) divided by something else.Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is ( (n+1)(n+2) - something ).Wait, for (n = 2), denominator is 6 = 3*4 - 6For (n = 3), denominator is 12 = 4*5 - 8For (n = 4), denominator is 21 = 5*6 - 9Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe the denominator is ( (n+1)(n+2) - n ):For (n = 2): 3*4 - 2 = 10, no.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.Looking back at the examples:For (n = 2), the maximum sum is (frac{5}{6}), achieved by (a = 1), (b = 2), (c = 1), (d = 3).For (n = 3), the maximum is (frac{11}{12}), achieved by (a = 2), (b = 3), (c = 1), (d = 4).For (n = 4), the maximum is (frac{20}{21}), achieved by (a = 2), (b = 3), (c = 2), (d = 7). Wait, no, earlier I thought it was (frac{20}{21}), but actually, when (a = 2), (c = 2), (b = 3), (d = 7), the sum is (frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{7} = frac{14}{21} + frac{6}{21} = frac{20}{21}).Wait, but in that case, (a + c = 4), which is equal to (n). So, perhaps the general approach is to set (a = k), (c = n - k), and then choose (b) and (d) such that (frac{k}{b} + frac{n - k}{d}) is maximized but less than 1.To maximize the sum, we need to choose (k) such that the resulting fractions are as large as possible. It seems that choosing (k) around (n/2) might give a good balance, but not necessarily.Wait, in the case of (n = 4), choosing (k = 2) gave a higher sum than (k = 1) or (k = 3). So, maybe balancing (a) and (c) around (n/2) is the way to go.But how do I generalize this?Let me think about the general case. Suppose (a + c = n). Let me set (a = k) and (c = n - k). Then, I need to choose (b) and (d) such that (frac{k}{b} + frac{n - k}{d} < 1).To maximize the sum, I should minimize (b) and (d). However, they can't be too small because the sum must be less than 1.Let me fix (b) and solve for (d). For a given (b), the minimal (d) is the smallest integer such that (frac{n - k}{d} < 1 - frac{k}{b}).Rearranging, (d > frac{n - k}{1 - frac{k}{b}}).Similarly, for a given (d), (b > frac{k}{1 - frac{n - k}{d}}).But this seems too abstract. Maybe I can consider the case where (b = d). If I set (b = d), then the inequality becomes (frac{k}{b} + frac{n - k}{b} < 1), which simplifies to (frac{n}{b} < 1), so (b > n). But then, (b) would have to be at least (n + 1), making (frac{k}{b} + frac{n - k}{b} = frac{n}{b} leq frac{n}{n + 1}), which is less than 1. However, this might not be the maximum possible sum because if (b) and (d) are different, we might get a larger sum.Alternatively, maybe setting (b) and (d) such that (frac{k}{b} = frac{n - k}{d}). Let me denote this common value as (x). Then, (x + x < 1), so (x < frac{1}{2}). Therefore, (frac{k}{b} = frac{n - k}{d} = x), which implies (b = frac{k}{x}) and (d = frac{n - k}{x}). Since (b) and (d) must be integers, (x) must be a common fraction that divides both (k) and (n - k).But this approach might not always yield integer values for (b) and (d), so it's not straightforward.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of Egyptian fractions or something similar, where we express numbers as sums of unit fractions. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the greedy algorithm. Start with the largest possible fraction less than 1, then subtract it and find the next largest fraction that keeps the sum below 1.But in this case, since both fractions are variables, it's a bit more complex.Wait, going back to the examples, for (n = 2), the maximum was (frac{5}{6}), which is (1 - frac{1}{6}). For (n = 3), it was (frac{11}{12} = 1 - frac{1}{12}). For (n = 4), it was (frac{20}{21} = 1 - frac{1}{21}).Looking at the denominators: 6, 12, 21. These are 2*3, 3*4, 4*5. So, for (n), the denominator seems to be (n(n + 1)). Therefore, the maximum sum is (1 - frac{1}{n(n + 1)}).Wait, let's test this for (n = 4): (1 - frac{1}{4*5} = 1 - frac{1}{20} = frac{19}{20}), but earlier I found (frac{20}{21}) as the maximum. So, this doesn't match.Wait, maybe the denominator is ((n + 1)(n + 2)). For (n = 2), that would be 12, but we have 6. Hmm, not matching.Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}). For (n = 2), that's 6, which matches. For (n = 3), it's 10, but we have 12. Doesn't match.Wait, perhaps it's ((n + 1)(n + 2) - something). For (n = 2), 3*4 - 6 = 6. For (n = 3), 4*5 - 8 = 12. For (n = 4), 5*6 - 9 = 21. So, the subtracted term is (n + 1). So, denominator is ((n + 1)(n + 2) - (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 1)). Wait, that would be ((n + 1)^2). For (n = 2), 9, which doesn't match 6. Hmm, no.Alternatively, maybe the denominator is ((n + 1)(n + 2) - n). For (n = 2), 12 - 2 = 10, nope.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.In the examples, the maximum sum is (1 - frac{1}{m}), where (m) is the product of two consecutive integers. For (n = 2), (m = 6 = 2*3). For (n = 3), (m = 12 = 3*4). For (n = 4), (m = 21 = 4*5.25), which isn't an integer. Wait, but 21 is 3*7, which doesn't fit.Wait, 6, 12, 21 are the triangular numbers multiplied by 2: 3rd triangular number is 6, 4th is 10, 5th is 15, but 12 and 21 aren't multiples of triangular numbers.Alternatively, 6 is 3!, 12 is 4!, 21 is not 5! (which is 120). So, that doesn't fit.Wait, maybe the denominator is the product of (n + 1) and (n + 2) divided by something. For (n = 2), 3*4 = 12, divided by 2 is 6. For (n = 3), 4*5 = 20, divided by something is 12. 20 divided by 1.666 is 12, which isn't an integer. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of (b) and (d). For (n = 2), LCM(2,3) = 6. For (n = 3), LCM(3,4) = 12. For (n = 4), LCM(3,7) = 21. Ah, that seems to fit!Yes, for (n = 2), (b = 2), (d = 3), LCM(2,3) = 6.For (n = 3), (b = 3), (d = 4), LCM(3,4) = 12.For (n = 4), (b = 3), (d = 7), LCM(3,7) = 21.So, the denominator is the LCM of (b) and (d), which are chosen such that (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d}) is maximized but less than 1.Therefore, the maximum sum is (1 - frac{1}{text{LCM}(b, d)}).But how do I find (b) and (d) for a general (n)?From the examples, it seems that (b) is around (n/2) and (d) is chosen accordingly. For (n = 2), (b = 2), (d = 3). For (n = 3), (b = 3), (d = 4). For (n = 4), (b = 3), (d = 7).Wait, for (n = 4), (b = 3), which is less than (n/2 = 2). Hmm, that doesn't fit.Wait, maybe (b) is the smallest integer greater than (n/2). For (n = 2), (n/2 = 1), so (b = 2). For (n = 3), (n/2 = 1.5), so (b = 2), but in our example, (b = 3). Hmm, not matching.Alternatively, perhaps (b) is chosen such that (a = b - 1), which would make (frac{a}{b} = frac{b - 1}{b}), which is close to 1. Then, (c = n - (b - 1)), and we need to choose (d) such that (frac{c}{d}) is as large as possible without making the sum exceed 1.So, let's formalize this:Let (a = b - 1), then (c = n - (b - 1) = n - b + 1).Then, the sum is:[frac{b - 1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{d} < 1]Simplify:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{d} < 1]Subtract 1 from both sides:[- frac{1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{d} < 0]Rearrange:[frac{n - b + 1}{d} < frac{1}{b}]Multiply both sides by (d):[n - b + 1 < frac{d}{b}]Multiply both sides by (b):[b(n - b + 1) < d]Since (d) must be an integer, the minimal (d) is (b(n - b + 1) + 1).Therefore, the sum becomes:[frac{b - 1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{b(n - b + 1) + 1}]Simplify:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{b(n - b + 1) + 1}]Let me denote (k = n - b + 1), then:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{k}{bk + 1}]But (k = n - b + 1), so:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{b(n - b + 1) + 1}]This expression seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a way to maximize it.Let me compute this for the examples:For (n = 2):Choose (b = 2), then (k = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1), so:[1 - frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2*1 + 1} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} = frac{5}{6}]Which matches.For (n = 3):Choose (b = 3), then (k = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1), so:[1 - frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3*1 + 1} = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{4} = frac{11}{12}]Which matches.For (n = 4):Choose (b = 3), then (k = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2), so:[1 - frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{3*2 + 1} = frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{7} = frac{14}{21} + frac{6}{21} = frac{20}{21}]Which matches.So, this formula seems to work for these examples. Therefore, the maximum sum is:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{b(n - b + 1) + 1}]But we need to choose (b) such that this expression is maximized. How do we choose (b)?From the examples, it seems that choosing (b) as large as possible (close to (n)) gives a higher sum. For (n = 2), (b = 2); for (n = 3), (b = 3); for (n = 4), (b = 3). Wait, for (n = 4), (b = 3) is less than (n). Hmm.Wait, maybe (b) should be chosen such that (k = n - b + 1) is as large as possible, but not too large that (d) becomes too big, reducing the second fraction.Alternatively, perhaps the optimal (b) is around (frac{2n}{3}). Let me test this.For (n = 2), (frac{2*2}{3} approx 1.333), so (b = 2).For (n = 3), (frac{2*3}{3} = 2), but in our example, (b = 3) gave a better result.Wait, maybe it's better to set (b) such that (k = n - b + 1) is approximately equal to (b), balancing the two terms.Let me set (k = b), then:[n - b + 1 = b implies n + 1 = 2b implies b = frac{n + 1}{2}]So, if (n) is odd, (b) is an integer, otherwise, it's a half-integer. Since (b) must be an integer, we can take (b = lfloor frac{n + 1}{2} rfloor) or (b = lceil frac{n + 1}{2} rceil).Let me test this for (n = 4):[b = frac{4 + 1}{2} = 2.5 implies b = 3]Which matches our earlier choice.For (n = 5):[b = frac{5 + 1}{2} = 3]So, (b = 3), then (k = 5 - 3 + 1 = 3), so:[1 - frac{1}{3} + frac{3}{3*3 + 1} = frac{2}{3} + frac{3}{10} = frac{20}{30} + frac{9}{30} = frac{29}{30}]Is this the maximum for (n = 5)?Let me check other possibilities:1. (b = 2), then (k = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4), so:[1 - frac{1}{2} + frac{4}{2*4 + 1} = frac{1}{2} + frac{4}{9} = frac{9}{18} + frac{8}{18} = frac{17}{18} approx 0.9444]Which is less than (frac{29}{30} approx 0.9667).2. (b = 4), then (k = 5 - 4 + 1 = 2), so:[1 - frac{1}{4} + frac{2}{4*2 + 1} = frac{3}{4} + frac{2}{9} = frac{27}{36} + frac{8}{36} = frac{35}{36} approx 0.9722]Which is higher than (frac{29}{30}). So, maybe (b = 4) gives a better result.Wait, so my previous assumption that (b = frac{n + 1}{2}) might not always give the maximum.Let me compute for (b = 4):[frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d} = frac{3}{4} + frac{2}{9} = frac{35}{36} approx 0.9722]Is this the maximum?Let me check (b = 5):Then, (k = 5 - 5 + 1 = 1), so:[1 - frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{5*1 + 1} = frac{4}{5} + frac{1}{6} = frac{24}{30} + frac{5}{30} = frac{29}{30} approx 0.9667]Which is less than (frac{35}{36}).So, for (n = 5), the maximum is (frac{35}{36}), achieved by (b = 4), (d = 9).Wait, so maybe the optimal (b) is not exactly (frac{n + 1}{2}), but slightly larger. Let me see.For (n = 5), (b = 4) is closer to (frac{2n}{3} = frac{10}{3} approx 3.333). So, (b = 4) is the next integer.Similarly, for (n = 4), (frac{2n}{3} approx 2.666), so (b = 3).For (n = 3), (frac{2n}{3} = 2), but we chose (b = 3).Wait, maybe the optimal (b) is around (frac{2n}{3}), rounded up or down.Let me test this for (n = 6):(frac{2*6}{3} = 4), so (b = 4).Then, (k = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3), so:[1 - frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{4*3 + 1} = frac{3}{4} + frac{3}{13} approx 0.75 + 0.2308 = 0.9808]Alternatively, (b = 5):(k = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2), so:[1 - frac{1}{5} + frac{2}{5*2 + 1} = frac{4}{5} + frac{2}{11} approx 0.8 + 0.1818 = 0.9818]Which is slightly higher.(b = 6):(k = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1), so:[1 - frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{6*1 + 1} = frac{5}{6} + frac{1}{7} approx 0.8333 + 0.1429 = 0.9762]So, (b = 5) gives a higher sum.Wait, so for (n = 6), (b = 5) gives a higher sum than (b = 4) or (b = 6).This suggests that the optimal (b) is around (frac{2n}{3}), but sometimes slightly higher.Let me try to generalize this.Suppose (b = lfloor frac{2n}{3} rfloor + 1). For (n = 2), (frac{4}{3} approx 1.333), so (b = 2). For (n = 3), (frac{6}{3} = 2), so (b = 3). For (n = 4), (frac{8}{3} approx 2.666), so (b = 3). For (n = 5), (frac{10}{3} approx 3.333), so (b = 4). For (n = 6), (frac{12}{3} = 4), so (b = 5). Wait, no, (lfloor frac{12}{3} rfloor + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5), which matches.So, the formula (b = lfloor frac{2n}{3} rfloor + 1) seems to give the optimal (b) for the examples I've tried.Therefore, the maximum sum is:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{k}{bk + 1}]where (k = n - b + 1) and (b = lfloor frac{2n}{3} rfloor + 1).But let me verify this for (n = 5):(b = lfloor frac{10}{3} rfloor + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4), which matches our earlier result.For (n = 6):(b = lfloor frac{12}{3} rfloor + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5), which also matches.So, this seems to be a consistent way to choose (b).Therefore, the maximum value of (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d}) is:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{b(n - b + 1) + 1}]where (b = lfloor frac{2n}{3} rfloor + 1).But let me express this in a more compact form.Let me denote (b = leftlfloor frac{2n}{3} rightrfloor + 1), then (k = n - b + 1).So, the sum becomes:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{k}{bk + 1}]But since (k = n - b + 1), we can write:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{n - b + 1}{b(n - b + 1) + 1}]This can be simplified as:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{k}{bk + 1}]But I don't see an immediate way to simplify this further. However, we can express the entire sum as:[1 - frac{1}{b(bk + 1)}]Wait, let me check:Starting from:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{k}{bk + 1}]Let me combine the terms:[1 - frac{1}{b} + frac{k}{bk + 1} = 1 - frac{bk + 1}{b(bk + 1)} + frac{k b}{b(bk + 1)} = 1 - frac{bk + 1 - k b}{b(bk + 1)} = 1 - frac{1}{b(bk + 1)}]Yes, that works! So, the sum simplifies to:[1 - frac{1}{b(bk + 1)}]Where (k = n - b + 1).Therefore, the maximum sum is:[1 - frac{1}{b(b(n - b + 1) + 1)}]With (b = lfloor frac{2n}{3} rfloor + 1).This formula seems to hold for the examples I've tested.For (n = 2):(b = 2), (k = 1), so:[1 - frac{1}{2(2*1 + 1)} = 1 - frac{1}{6} = frac{5}{6}]For (n = 3):(b = 3), (k = 1), so:[1 - frac{1}{3(3*1 + 1)} = 1 - frac{1}{12} = frac{11}{12}]For (n = 4):(b = 3), (k = 2), so:[1 - frac{1}{3(3*2 + 1)} = 1 - frac{1}{21} = frac{20}{21}]For (n = 5):(b = 4), (k = 2), so:[1 - frac{1}{4(4*2 + 1)} = 1 - frac{1}{36} = frac{35}{36}]For (n = 6):(b = 5), (k = 2), so:[1 - frac{1}{5(5*2 + 1)} = 1 - frac{1}{55} = frac{54}{55}]Wait, but earlier for (n = 6), I found (frac{35}{36} approx 0.9722) when (b = 5), but according to this formula, it's (frac{54}{55} approx 0.9818). Wait, that's a discrepancy.Wait, no, for (n = 6), (b = 5), (k = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2), so:[1 - frac{1}{5(5*2 + 1)} = 1 - frac{1}{55} = frac{54}{55} approx 0.9818]But earlier, when I set (b = 5), I calculated:[frac{4}{5} + frac{2}{11} = frac{44}{55} + frac{10}{55} = frac{54}{55}]Yes, that's correct. So, the formula holds.Therefore, the general formula for the maximum sum is:[1 - frac{1}{b(b(n - b + 1) + 1)}]where (b = lfloor frac{2n}{3} rfloor + 1).But let me express this in terms of (n) without (b). Since (b) is approximately (frac{2n}{3}), we can write:[b approx frac{2n}{3}]Therefore, the denominator in the fraction is approximately:[b(b(n - b + 1) + 1) approx frac{2n}{3}left(frac{2n}{3}(n - frac{2n}{3} + 1) + 1right)]Simplify the expression inside:[n - frac{2n}{3} + 1 = frac{n}{3} + 1]So, the denominator becomes:[frac{2n}{3}left(frac{2n}{3}left(frac{n}{3} + 1right) + 1right)]This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a pattern or a closed-form expression.Alternatively, since (b = lfloor frac{2n}{3} rfloor + 1), for large (n), (b approx frac{2n}{3}), so the denominator is roughly (frac{2n}{3} cdot frac{2n}{3} cdot frac{n}{3} = frac{4n^3}{27}), making the fraction (frac{1}{frac{4n^3}{27}} = frac{27}{4n^3}), which tends to 0 as (n) increases, meaning the maximum sum approaches 1.But for exact values, we need to stick with the formula involving (b).Therefore, the maximum value of (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d}) is:[1 - frac{1}{b(b(n - b + 1) + 1)}]where (b = lfloor frac{2n}{3} rfloor + 1).But to express this without (b), we can write:[1 - frac{1}{left(leftlfloor frac{2n}{3} rightrfloor + 1right)left(left(leftlfloor frac{2n}{3} rightrfloor + 1right)left(n - left(leftlfloor frac{2n}{3} rightrfloor + 1right) + 1right) + 1right)}]This is quite a mouthful, but it's the exact expression.However, for simplicity, we can denote (b = leftlfloor frac{2n}{3} rightrfloor + 1) and (k = n - b + 1), then the maximum sum is:[1 - frac{1}{b(bk + 1)}]Which is a more compact way to write it.In conclusion, the maximum value of (frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d}) under the given constraints is:[1 - frac{1}{b(bk + 1)}]where (b = leftlfloor frac{2n}{3} rightrfloor + 1) and (k = n - b + 1).This formula has been verified for several values of (n), and it consistently gives the correct maximum sum."},{"question":"A cubic box has faces whose surface areas are 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, and 36 square units. Each side length is reduced uniformly by 1 unit. Find the sum of the new dimensions of the cube.A. 12B. 15C. 18D. 21E. 24","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a cubic box. All the faces have a surface area of 36 square units each. Then, each side length is reduced uniformly by 1 unit, and I need to find the sum of the new dimensions of the cube. The options are A. 12, B. 15, C. 18, D. 21, and E. 24.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A cube has six faces, and each face is a square. The surface area of each face is given as 36 square units. Since all faces of a cube are equal, this makes sense. So, each face has an area of 36, which is a square, so the side length of each face must be the square root of 36. Let me calculate that: the square root of 36 is 6. So, each side of the cube is 6 units long.Now, the problem says that each side length is reduced uniformly by 1 unit. So, if each original side is 6 units, subtracting 1 unit from each side would make the new side length 5 units. Since it's a cube, all sides are equal, so each of the three dimensions (length, width, height) will be 5 units after the reduction.The question asks for the sum of the new dimensions. Since all dimensions are the same, I can just add them up. So, 5 units + 5 units + 5 units equals 15 units. Therefore, the sum of the new dimensions is 15.Let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original surface area per face is 36, so each side is 6. Reducing each side by 1 gives 5, and adding them together gives 15. That seems correct.I also want to make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. It says each side length is reduced uniformly by 1 unit. So, it's not reducing the volume or anything else, just each side by 1 unit. So, yes, each dimension becomes 5, and their sum is 15.Looking at the answer choices, 15 is option B.

Let me try to understand the problem step by step.First, a domino covers two adjacent squares. That means each domino will always cover two squares, right? So, if I have a board with an odd number of squares, it can't be completely covered by dominoes because dominoes cover two squares each, and you can't have half a domino. That seems like a good starting point.Now, let's look at the boards one by one.1. **5x5 board with no defects:**   - Okay, a 5x5 board has 25 squares in total.   - Since 25 is an odd number, and each domino covers two squares, it's impossible to cover all 25 squares with dominoes without overlapping or leaving some squares uncovered.   - So, the 5x5 board can't be completely covered by dominoes.2. **4x5 board with no defects:**   - A 4x5 board has 20 squares.   - 20 is an even number, so in theory, it should be possible to cover it with dominoes because 20 divided by 2 is 10, which means we would need 10 dominoes.   - But wait, I should also consider the arrangement of the squares. In a checkerboard pattern, the squares alternate between black and white. If the board has equal numbers of black and white squares, then it can be tiled with dominoes because each domino covers one black and one white square.   - A 4x5 board has 20 squares, which means 10 black and 10 white squares. So, it should be possible to cover it completely with dominoes.   - Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's something else I'm missing. Let me think. Since 4 and 5 are both even and odd respectively, the board is even in one dimension and odd in the other. But since the total number of squares is even, and the number of black and white squares is equal, I think it should work. So, the 4x5 board can be covered.3. **4x4 board with one square removed:**   - A 4x4 board has 16 squares. If one square is removed, we have 15 squares left.   - 15 is an odd number, so similar to the 5x5 board, it's impossible to cover all 15 squares with dominoes because each domino covers two squares.   - Additionally, even if we consider the checkerboard pattern, removing one square would leave an imbalance in the number of black and white squares. For example, if the removed square was black, we would have 8 white squares and 7 black squares. Since each domino covers one black and one white square, we can't cover all squares because there's an unequal number.   - So, the 4x4 board with one square removed can't be completely covered by dominoes.4. **6x3 board with no defects:**   - A 6x3 board has 18 squares.   - 18 is an even number, so in theory, it should be possible to cover it with dominoes because 18 divided by 2 is 9, meaning we would need 9 dominoes.   - Let me check the checkerboard pattern. A 6x3 board has 18 squares, which means 9 black and 9 white squares. So, it's balanced.   - Also, the dimensions are 6 and 3, which are both multiples of 3 and 2 respectively. I think this should work because dominoes can be arranged either horizontally or vertically without any issues.   - So, the 6x3 board can be covered completely by dominoes.Wait a minute, I'm a bit confused about the 4x5 board. Earlier, I thought it could be covered, but now I'm second-guessing myself. Let me visualize a 4x5 grid. If I try to place dominoes horizontally, each row has 5 squares, which is odd. So, in each row, I can place two dominoes horizontally, covering 4 squares, and then one square will be left. But then, I can't cover that last square with a horizontal domino. Maybe I need to place some dominoes vertically instead.If I place dominoes vertically, each column has 4 squares, which is even. So, in each column, I can place two dominoes vertically, covering all 4 squares. Since there are 5 columns, that would require 5 columns x 2 dominoes each = 10 dominoes. But wait, that's 10 dominoes, each covering 2 squares, so 20 squares in total, which matches the 4x5 board. So, it seems like it can be covered.But I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe there's a parity issue or something else. Let me think about the checkerboard pattern again. In a 4x5 board, the top-left corner is, say, black. Then the squares alternate colors. So, in each row, starting with black, the colors would be black, white, black, white, black. So, each row has 3 black squares and 2 white squares. Since there are 4 rows, the total number of black squares would be 4 x 3 = 12, and white squares would be 4 x 2 = 8. Wait, that's 12 black and 8 white squares, which is unequal. That means the number of black and white squares isn't the same, which is a problem because each domino covers one black and one white square.Oh, so that's the issue! If the number of black and white squares isn't equal, you can't cover the board completely with dominoes. So, in the 4x5 board, we have 12 black and 8 white squares. That means we can only cover 8 dominoes, covering 8 black and 8 white squares, leaving 4 black squares uncovered. Therefore, the 4x5 board cannot be completely covered by dominoes.Wait, but earlier I thought it could be covered because the total number of squares is even. But now, considering the imbalance in black and white squares, it can't be covered. So, I was wrong earlier. The 4x5 board can't be covered because of the unequal number of black and white squares.Similarly, for the 6x3 board, let's check the number of black and white squares. A 6x3 board has 18 squares. If the top-left corner is black, then each row would alternate colors. So, in a 6x3 board, each row has 3 squares. Starting with black, the colors would be black, white, black. So, each row has 2 black squares and 1 white square. With 6 rows, the total number of black squares would be 6 x 2 = 12, and white squares would be 6 x 1 = 6. Wait, that's 12 black and 6 white squares, which is unequal. So, similar to the 4x5 board, the 6x3 board has an unequal number of black and white squares, making it impossible to cover completely with dominoes.But wait, earlier I thought the 6x3 board could be covered because the total number of squares is even. But now, considering the checkerboard pattern, it's unequal. So, I was wrong again. The 6x3 board can't be covered because of the unequal number of black and white squares.Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me double-check. For the 4x5 board, if it's a standard checkerboard pattern, the number of black and white squares should be equal if the total number of squares is even. But in this case, 4x5=20, which is even, but the number of black and white squares isn't equal. That seems contradictory.Let me think again. In a standard checkerboard pattern, for a board with even dimensions, the number of black and white squares is equal. But in this case, 4x5 is even in total squares, but the number of black and white squares isn't equal. That must mean that the board isn't a standard checkerboard pattern, or perhaps the coloring is different.Wait, no, the problem mentions \\"checkerboards,\\" so it's safe to assume that they follow the standard checkerboard pattern. So, in a 4x5 board, starting with black in the top-left corner, the colors would alternate. So, each row would have 3 black and 2 white squares, as I thought earlier. With 4 rows, that would give 12 black and 8 white squares. So, unequal.Similarly, for the 6x3 board, starting with black, each row would have 2 black and 1 white square, with 6 rows, giving 12 black and 6 white squares. So, unequal.Therefore, both the 4x5 and 6x3 boards have unequal numbers of black and white squares, making them impossible to cover completely with dominoes, even though their total number of squares is even.But wait, earlier I thought the 4x5 board could be covered because the total squares are even, but now I'm seeing that it's impossible because of the unequal black and white squares. So, that changes my initial conclusion.Similarly, for the 6x3 board, I thought it could be covered because the total squares are even, but now I'm seeing that it's impossible because of the unequal black and white squares.So, to summarize:1. **5x5 board:** 25 squares (odd), can't be covered.2. **4x5 board:** 20 squares (even), but unequal black and white squares (12 black, 8 white), can't be covered.3. **4x4 board with one square removed:** 15 squares (odd), can't be covered.4. **6x3 board:** 18 squares (even), but unequal black and white squares (12 black, 6 white), can't be covered.Wait, that means all four boards can't be covered? But that doesn't seem right because I thought some could be covered.Wait, no, let's clarify. The 4x5 and 6x3 boards have even total squares but unequal black and white squares, making them impossible to cover. The 5x5 and 4x4 boards have odd total squares, making them impossible to cover.So, all four boards can't be covered? But that seems too broad. Let me check again.For the 4x5 board, total squares 20 (even), but black and white squares unequal (12 and 8). So, can't be covered.For the 6x3 board, total squares 18 (even), but black and white squares unequal (12 and 6). So, can't be covered.For the 5x5 board, total squares 25 (odd), can't be covered.For the 4x4 board with one square removed, total squares 15 (odd), can't be covered.So, actually, all four boards can't be covered? But that seems unlikely because I thought some could be covered.Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \\"which cannot be completely covered by non-overlapping dominoes?\\" So, it's asking which ones can't be covered, not which can.So, if all four can't be covered, then the answer would be all of them. But that doesn't seem right because I thought some could be covered.Wait, let me think about the 4x5 board again. If it's a 4x5 board, can I arrange dominoes in such a way that they cover all squares despite the unequal black and white squares? Maybe not, because each domino must cover one black and one white square, and if there are unequal numbers, some squares will be left uncovered.Similarly, for the 6x3 board, the same logic applies.So, in conclusion, the 5x5 board, the 4x5 board, the 4x4 board with one square removed, and the 6x3 board all cannot be completely covered by non-overlapping dominoes.But wait, the options given are:A) 5x5 boardB) 4x5 boardC) 4x4 board with one square removedD) 6x3 boardE) 4x5 and 6x3 boardsSo, according to my analysis, all four boards can't be covered, but the options don't include an option that says all four. The closest is E) 4x5 and 6x3 boards.But earlier, I thought the 5x5 and 4x4 boards can't be covered because of odd total squares, and the 4x5 and 6x3 boards can't be covered because of unequal black and white squares.So, the answer should include all four boards, but since that's not an option, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, perhaps the 4x5 and 6x3 boards can be covered despite the unequal black and white squares. Maybe there's a way to arrange the dominoes to cover all squares even if the number of black and white squares isn't equal.But that doesn't make sense because each domino must cover one black and one white square. If there are unequal numbers, some squares will be left uncovered.So, I think my initial conclusion is correct. All four boards can't be covered. But since the options don't include all four, maybe the answer is E) 4x5 and 6x3 boards, and A and C are also correct, but since they are separate options, I need to choose all that apply.But the problem asks \\"which cannot be completely covered,\\" and the options are A, B, C, D, or E.So, the correct answer is A, B, C, and D. But since that's not an option, I need to see which ones are correct.Wait, maybe I was wrong about the 4x5 and 6x3 boards. Let me think again.For the 4x5 board, total squares 20, which is even, but black and white squares are 12 and 8. So, can't be covered.For the 6x3 board, total squares 18, which is even, but black and white squares are 12 and 6. So, can't be covered.For the 5x5 board, total squares 25, which is odd, can't be covered.For the 4x4 board with one square removed, total squares 15, which is odd, can't be covered.So, all four boards can't be covered. But the options don't include all four. The options are A, B, C, D, or E.So, perhaps the answer is A, B, C, and D, but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is E) 4x5 and 6x3 boards, and also A and C.But the problem asks \\"which cannot be completely covered,\\" and the options are A, B, C, D, or E.So, the correct answer is A, B, C, and D, but since that's not an option, I need to see which ones are correct.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the black and white squares.For the 4x5 board, starting with black in the top-left corner, the first row would be black, white, black, white, black (3 black, 2 white). The second row would start with white, so white, black, white, black, white (2 black, 3 white). The third row would start with black again, so black, white, black, white, black (3 black, 2 white). The fourth row would start with white, so white, black, white, black, white (2 black, 3 white).So, total black squares: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 10Total white squares: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, actually, the 4x5 board has equal numbers of black and white squares (10 each). So, my earlier calculation was wrong.Similarly, for the 6x3 board, starting with black in the top-left corner, each row would be black, white, black (2 black, 1 white). With 6 rows, total black squares: 6 x 2 = 12, white squares: 6 x 1 = 6. But wait, that's unequal.Wait, no, in a 6x3 board, if it's a standard checkerboard pattern, the first row would be black, white, black. The second row would start with white, so white, black, white. The third row would start with black, and so on.So, for 6 rows:Rows 1, 3, 5: black, white, black (2 black, 1 white)Rows 2, 4, 6: white, black, white (1 black, 2 white)So, total black squares: 3 rows x 2 = 6, plus 3 rows x 1 = 3, total 9Total white squares: 3 rows x 1 = 3, plus 3 rows x 2 = 6, total 9So, equal number of black and white squares (9 each). So, my earlier calculation was wrong.So, the 6x3 board has equal numbers of black and white squares, making it possible to cover with dominoes.Wait, so now I'm confused again. Let me recalculate.For the 4x5 board:Rows 1 and 3: black, white, black, white, black (3 black, 2 white)Rows 2 and 4: white, black, white, black, white (2 black, 3 white)Total black squares: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 10Total white squares: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10So, equal numbers.For the 6x3 board:Rows 1,3,5: black, white, black (2 black, 1 white)Rows 2,4,6: white, black, white (1 black, 2 white)Total black squares: 3 x 2 + 3 x 1 = 6 + 3 = 9Total white squares: 3 x 1 + 3 x 2 = 3 + 6 = 9So, equal numbers.Therefore, both the 4x5 and 6x3 boards have equal numbers of black and white squares, making them possible to cover with dominoes.Wait, so my initial mistake was in counting the black and white squares incorrectly. So, the 4x5 and 6x3 boards can be covered with dominoes.Therefore, the boards that can't be covered are:1. 5x5 board (25 squares, odd)3. 4x4 board with one square removed (15 squares, odd)So, the answer is A and C.But let me double-check the 4x5 and 6x3 boards.For the 4x5 board, since it has equal numbers of black and white squares and the total is even, it can be covered.For the 6x3 board, same logic applies.Therefore, the boards that can't be covered are the 5x5 and the 4x4 with one square removed."},{"question":"Find the product of the solutions of the equation: |y|=3(|y|-2).","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: |y| = 3(|y| - 2). Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes be tricky because they involve both positive and negative possibilities. Let me see how to approach this step by step.First, I should probably simplify the equation. Let me write it down again:|y| = 3(|y| - 2)Hmm, maybe I can distribute the 3 on the right side to make it easier to handle. Let me try that:|y| = 3|y| - 6Okay, now I have |y| on both sides of the equation. Maybe I can get all the |y| terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let me subtract 3|y| from both sides to move that term:|y| - 3|y| = -6Simplifying the left side, |y| minus 3|y| is -2|y|:-2|y| = -6Now, I can solve for |y| by dividing both sides by -2:|y| = (-6)/(-2)|y| = 3Alright, so |y| equals 3. That means y can be either 3 or -3 because the absolute value of both 3 and -3 is 3. So, the solutions are y = 3 and y = -3.Now, the question asks for the product of the solutions.

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:[frac{1}{2 + sqrt{2}} cdot frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2 - sqrt{2}} = frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{(2 + sqrt{2})(2 - sqrt{2})}]Using the difference of squares formula, the denominator becomes:[(2 + sqrt{2})(2 - sqrt{2}) = 2^2 - (sqrt{2})^2 = 4 - 2 = 2]Thus,[frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2}]Next, we simplify (frac{1}{sqrt{2} - 2}).

Find the least value of the difference (n-m) so that (m < x < n), expressed as a common fraction.","answer":"Okay, so I have this triangle problem where I need to find the least value of the difference ( n - m ) such that ( m < x < n ). The triangle has sides given by ( 2x + 5 ), ( 4x - 3 ), and ( x + 15 ). The side ( 2x + 5 ) corresponds to ( AB ), ( 4x - 3 ) corresponds to ( AC ), and ( x + 15 ) corresponds to ( BC ). The key here is that angle ( A ) needs to be the largest angle in the triangle. First, I remember that in a triangle, the largest angle is opposite the longest side. So, if angle ( A ) is the largest, then the side opposite angle ( A ) must be the longest side. Looking at the triangle, angle ( A ) is between sides ( AB ) and ( AC ), so the side opposite angle ( A ) is ( BC ). Therefore, ( BC ) must be the longest side. So, ( BC ) must be greater than both ( AB ) and ( AC ). That gives me two inequalities:1. ( x + 15 > 2x + 5 )2. ( x + 15 > 4x - 3 )Let me solve the first inequality:( x + 15 > 2x + 5 )Subtract ( x ) from both sides:( 15 > x + 5 )Subtract 5 from both sides:( 10 > x ) or ( x < 10 )Now, the second inequality:( x + 15 > 4x - 3 )Subtract ( x ) from both sides:( 15 > 3x - 3 )Add 3 to both sides:( 18 > 3x )Divide both sides by 3:( 6 > x ) or ( x < 6 )So, from these two inequalities, I know that ( x ) must be less than 6.But I also need to make sure that the sides form a valid triangle. For that, the triangle inequality must hold. The triangle inequalities state that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, I need to check all three combinations:1. ( AB + AC > BC )2. ( AB + BC > AC )3. ( AC + BC > AB )Let's plug in the expressions:1. ( (2x + 5) + (4x - 3) > (x + 15) )2. ( (2x + 5) + (x + 15) > (4x - 3) )3. ( (4x - 3) + (x + 15) > (2x + 5) )Let me simplify each inequality.Starting with the first one:( (2x + 5) + (4x - 3) > (x + 15) )Combine like terms:( 6x + 2 > x + 15 )Subtract ( x ) from both sides:( 5x + 2 > 15 )Subtract 2 from both sides:( 5x > 13 )Divide both sides by 5:( x > frac{13}{5} ) or ( x > 2.6 )Second inequality:( (2x + 5) + (x + 15) > (4x - 3) )Combine like terms:( 3x + 20 > 4x - 3 )Subtract ( 3x ) from both sides:( 20 > x - 3 )Add 3 to both sides:( 23 > x ) or ( x < 23 )Third inequality:( (4x - 3) + (x + 15) > (2x + 5) )Combine like terms:( 5x + 12 > 2x + 5 )Subtract ( 2x ) from both sides:( 3x + 12 > 5 )Subtract 12 from both sides:( 3x > -7 )Divide both sides by 3:( x > -frac{7}{3} ) or ( x > -2.overline{3} )Since ( x ) represents a length, it must be positive, so this inequality doesn't really add any new information because ( x ) has to be greater than ( 2.6 ) from the first inequality.So, combining all the inequalities:From the triangle inequalities, we have ( x > frac{13}{5} ) (which is 2.6) and ( x < 23 ). But from the requirement that angle ( A ) is the largest, we have ( x < 6 ). So, combining these, ( x ) must satisfy both ( x > 2.6 ) and ( x < 6 ). Therefore, the interval for ( x ) is ( frac{13}{5} < x < 6 ).Now, the problem asks for the least value of the difference ( n - m ) such that ( m < x < n ). Here, ( m ) is the lower bound and ( n ) is the upper bound. So, ( m = frac{13}{5} ) and ( n = 6 ). The difference ( n - m ) is ( 6 - frac{13}{5} ).Calculating that:( 6 = frac{30}{5} ), so:( frac{30}{5} - frac{13}{5} = frac{17}{5} )So, the least value of the difference ( n - m ) is ( frac{17}{5} ).I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning, I correctly identified that angle ( A ) being the largest implies that side ( BC ) is the longest. Then, I set up the inequalities correctly and solved them. The triangle inequalities were also correctly applied, and I combined the results appropriately. The arithmetic seems correct, so I think my answer is right.**Final Answer**The least value of the difference ( n - m ) is boxed{dfrac{17}{5}}."},{"question":"If the domain of the function y=f(x) is [0,2], then the domain of the function y=f(x+1)+f(x-1) is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If the domain of the function y = f(x) is [0,2], then what is the domain of the function y = f(x+1) + f(x-1)? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that the domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. In this case, the original function f(x) is defined for x between 0 and 2, inclusive. So, f(x) is only defined when x is in [0,2].Now, the new function is y = f(x+1) + f(x-1). This means that for each x in the domain of this new function, both f(x+1) and f(x-1) must be defined. So, I need to find all x such that both x+1 and x-1 are within the domain of f, which is [0,2].Let me write down the conditions for each part:1. For f(x+1) to be defined, the input x+1 must be in [0,2]. So, 0 ‚â§ x+1 ‚â§ 2.2. For f(x-1) to be defined, the input x-1 must be in [0,2]. So, 0 ‚â§ x-1 ‚â§ 2.Now, I need to solve these inequalities to find the possible x-values.Starting with the first inequality: 0 ‚â§ x+1 ‚â§ 2.Subtracting 1 from all parts of the inequality:0 - 1 ‚â§ x+1 - 1 ‚â§ 2 - 1-1 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1So, from the first condition, x must be between -1 and 1.Now, the second inequality: 0 ‚â§ x-1 ‚â§ 2.Adding 1 to all parts of the inequality:0 + 1 ‚â§ x-1 + 1 ‚â§ 2 + 11 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 3So, from the second condition, x must be between 1 and 3.Now, to find the domain of the new function, we need the intersection of the two intervals we found. The first interval is [-1, 1], and the second interval is [1, 3]. The intersection of these two intervals is just the point where they overlap, which is at x = 1.Therefore, the only x-value that satisfies both conditions is x = 1. So, the domain of y = f(x+1) + f(x-1) is just the single point 1.Wait, let me double-check that. If x is 1, then x+1 is 2 and x-1 is 0. Both 2 and 0 are within the domain [0,2] of f(x), so f(2) and f(0) are both defined. That makes sense.Is there any other x-value that could work? Let's see:If x is less than 1, say x = 0, then x+1 = 1 (which is okay) but x-1 = -1 (which is not in [0,2]). So, f(-1) is undefined, which means y would be undefined at x=0.If x is greater than 1, say x = 2, then x+1 = 3 (which is outside [0,2]) and x-1 = 1 (which is okay). So, f(3) is undefined, making y undefined at x=2.What about x = 1.5? Then x+1 = 2.5 (undefined) and x-1 = 0.5 (defined). Still, one part is undefined, so y is undefined.Similarly, x = -0.5: x+1 = 0.5 (defined), but x-1 = -1.5 (undefined). So, y is undefined.Therefore, the only x that works is x=1.

Let me try to think through this step by step.First, part (1) says that vectors a and b are perpendicular. Vector a is (sinŒ∏, -2) and vector b is (1, cosŒ∏). I remember that if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, I should calculate the dot product of a and b and set it equal to zero.The dot product is calculated by multiplying the corresponding components and then adding them together. So, that would be (sinŒ∏)(1) + (-2)(cosŒ∏). That simplifies to sinŒ∏ - 2cosŒ∏. Since they're perpendicular, this should equal zero. So, sinŒ∏ - 2cosŒ∏ = 0. Hmm, okay, that gives me one equation.But I also know that for any angle Œ∏, sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1. That's the Pythagorean identity. So, now I have two equations:1. sinŒ∏ - 2cosŒ∏ = 02. sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1I can use the first equation to express sinŒ∏ in terms of cosŒ∏ or vice versa. Let me solve for sinŒ∏ from the first equation. If sinŒ∏ - 2cosŒ∏ = 0, then sinŒ∏ = 2cosŒ∏. That seems straightforward.Now, I can substitute sinŒ∏ = 2cosŒ∏ into the second equation. So, replacing sinŒ∏ with 2cosŒ∏, the equation becomes (2cosŒ∏)¬≤ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1. Let me compute that: (4cos¬≤Œ∏) + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1. Combining like terms, that's 5cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1. So, cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1/5. Taking the square root of both sides, cosŒ∏ = ¬±‚àö(1/5) = ¬±‚àö5/5.But wait, the problem states that Œ∏ is between 0 and œÄ/2, which is the first quadrant. In the first quadrant, both sine and cosine are positive. So, cosŒ∏ must be positive. Therefore, cosŒ∏ = ‚àö5/5.Now, since sinŒ∏ = 2cosŒ∏, substituting the value of cosŒ∏ gives sinŒ∏ = 2*(‚àö5/5) = 2‚àö5/5. So, I think that gives me the values for sinŒ∏ and cosŒ∏.Let me just double-check my steps. I used the dot product condition correctly, substituted sinŒ∏ in terms of cosŒ∏, solved for cosŒ∏, and then found sinŒ∏. Everything seems to add up. So, part (1) is done.Moving on to part (2). The equation given is 5cos(Œ∏ - œÜ) = 3‚àö5 cosœÜ, and œÜ is between 0 and œÄ/2. I need to find œÜ.First, I remember the cosine of a difference formula: cos(Œ∏ - œÜ) = cosŒ∏ cosœÜ + sinŒ∏ sinœÜ. So, I can expand the left side of the equation.Substituting that into the equation, we get:5[cosŒ∏ cosœÜ + sinŒ∏ sinœÜ] = 3‚àö5 cosœÜ.Let me distribute the 5:5cosŒ∏ cosœÜ + 5sinŒ∏ sinœÜ = 3‚àö5 cosœÜ.Now, I can plug in the values of sinŒ∏ and cosŒ∏ that I found in part (1). From part (1), sinŒ∏ = 2‚àö5/5 and cosŒ∏ = ‚àö5/5.Substituting these into the equation:5*(‚àö5/5)*cosœÜ + 5*(2‚àö5/5)*sinœÜ = 3‚àö5 cosœÜ.Let me simplify each term:First term: 5*(‚àö5/5) = ‚àö5, so it becomes ‚àö5 cosœÜ.Second term: 5*(2‚àö5/5) = 2‚àö5, so it becomes 2‚àö5 sinœÜ.So, the equation becomes:‚àö5 cosœÜ + 2‚àö5 sinœÜ = 3‚àö5 cosœÜ.Hmm, okay. Let me write that as:‚àö5 cosœÜ + 2‚àö5 sinœÜ - 3‚àö5 cosœÜ = 0.Combining like terms:(‚àö5 cosœÜ - 3‚àö5 cosœÜ) + 2‚àö5 sinœÜ = 0.That simplifies to:(-2‚àö5 cosœÜ) + 2‚àö5 sinœÜ = 0.I can factor out 2‚àö5:2‚àö5 (-cosœÜ + sinœÜ) = 0.Since 2‚àö5 is not zero, we can divide both sides by 2‚àö5:-sinœÜ + cosœÜ = 0.Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that again. The equation after factoring is 2‚àö5 (-cosœÜ + sinœÜ) = 0. So, dividing both sides by 2‚àö5 gives:-cosœÜ + sinœÜ = 0.Which simplifies to sinœÜ = cosœÜ.Hmm, okay. So, sinœÜ = cosœÜ. I know that this occurs when tanœÜ = 1, because tanœÜ = sinœÜ / cosœÜ. So, if sinœÜ = cosœÜ, then tanœÜ = 1.And since œÜ is between 0 and œÄ/2, the angle whose tangent is 1 is œÄ/4. So, œÜ = œÄ/4.Let me just verify my steps again. I used the cosine difference identity, substituted the known values, simplified, and ended up with tanœÜ = 1, leading to œÜ = œÄ/4. That seems correct.So, summarizing:1. sinŒ∏ = 2‚àö5/5 and cosŒ∏ = ‚àö5/5.2. œÜ = œÄ/4.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident with these answers.**Final Answer**(1) sintheta = boxed{dfrac{2sqrt{5}}{5}} and costheta = boxed{dfrac{sqrt{5}}{5}};  (2) varphi = boxed{dfrac{pi}{4}}."},{"question":"The number of solutions to {1, 2, 3} subseteq X subseteq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, where X is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is:textbf{(A) }4qquad textbf{(B) }6qquad textbf{(C) }8qquad textbf{(D) }10qquad  textbf{(E) }text{None of these}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of solutions where the set {1, 2, 3} is a subset of X, and X is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The options given are A) 4, B) 6, C) 8, D) 10, and E) None of these.Alright, let me try to understand what this means. So, X is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which means X can have any combination of these numbers, right? But there's a condition: {1, 2, 3} must be a subset of X. That means that X has to include all three elements 1, 2, and 3. So, X can't be missing any of these; they have to be in there.So, if I think about it, since 1, 2, and 3 are already in X, the only thing that can vary are the elements 4, 5, and 6. Those are the ones that can be either included or not included in X. So, for each of these elements, there are two choices: either they're in X or they're not.Let me write this down. The set X must include {1, 2, 3}, and then it can include any combination of 4, 5, and 6. So, the number of possible subsets X is equal to the number of subsets of {4, 5, 6}, because each subset of {4, 5, 6} can be combined with {1, 2, 3} to form a valid X.Now, how many subsets does a set with 3 elements have? I remember that the number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. So, for {4, 5, 6}, which has 3 elements, the number of subsets is 2^3, which is 8.So, that means there are 8 possible subsets X that satisfy {1, 2, 3} being a subset of X, which is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.Let me just double-check that. If I list them out, they would be:1. {1, 2, 3}2. {1, 2, 3, 4}3. {1, 2, 3, 5}4. {1, 2, 3, 6}5. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}6. {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}7. {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}8. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}Yep, that's 8 subsets. So, the answer should be 8, which is option C.I don't think I made any mistakes here. It makes sense because once you fix the elements that must be included, the rest just vary freely, and the number of variations is based on the remaining elements. Since there are 3 elements that can be included or not, it's 2^3, which is 8.So, yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is C) 8."},{"question":"A square is labeled with vertices ABCD, starting from the bottom left and moving clockwise.

Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the function given is f(x) = sin(2x). I know that the sine function has a period, and for sin(2x), the period is œÄ because the period of sin(kx) is 2œÄ/k. So here, k is 2, making the period œÄ. That means the graph repeats every œÄ units.Now, the graph is shifted to the right by œÜ units to get g(x). So, g(x) should be sin(2(x - œÜ)) which simplifies to sin(2x - 2œÜ). That makes sense because shifting right by œÜ units is the same as replacing x with (x - œÜ) in the function.The problem states that for some x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ, the absolute difference between f(x‚ÇÅ) and g(x‚ÇÇ) is 2. Since the sine function only takes values between -1 and 1, the maximum difference between any two sine function values is 2. That would happen when one is at its maximum (1) and the other is at its minimum (-1). So, |f(x‚ÇÅ) - g(x‚ÇÇ)| = 2 implies that f(x‚ÇÅ) = 1 and g(x‚ÇÇ) = -1, or vice versa.The next condition is that the minimum absolute difference between x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ is œÄ/3. So, |x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ|_{min} = œÄ/3. I need to find œÜ such that this condition holds.Let me think about when f(x) = sin(2x) reaches its maximum and minimum. The maximum of 1 occurs when 2x = œÄ/2 + 2œÄk, so x = œÄ/4 + œÄk. The minimum of -1 occurs when 2x = 3œÄ/2 + 2œÄk, so x = 3œÄ/4 + œÄk, where k is any integer.Similarly, for g(x) = sin(2x - 2œÜ), the maximum of 1 occurs when 2x - 2œÜ = œÄ/2 + 2œÄm, so x = œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm. The minimum of -1 occurs when 2x - 2œÜ = 3œÄ/2 + 2œÄm, so x = 3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm, where m is any integer.So, if f(x‚ÇÅ) = 1, then x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4 + œÄk. If g(x‚ÇÇ) = -1, then x‚ÇÇ = 3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm. The difference between x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ would be (3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm) - (œÄ/4 + œÄk) = (3œÄ/4 - œÄ/4) + œÜ + œÄ(m - k) = œÄ/2 + œÜ + œÄ(m - k).We want the minimum absolute difference, so we can set m - k = 0 to minimize the difference. That gives |x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ| = |œÄ/2 + œÜ|. But wait, the problem says the minimum difference is œÄ/3. So, |œÄ/2 + œÜ| = œÄ/3? That doesn't seem right because œÄ/2 is already larger than œÄ/3, and œÜ is positive.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If f(x‚ÇÅ) = 1, then x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4 + œÄk. If g(x‚ÇÇ) = -1, then x‚ÇÇ = 3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm. So, x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = (3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm) - (œÄ/4 + œÄk) = (3œÄ/4 - œÄ/4) + œÜ + œÄ(m - k) = œÄ/2 + œÜ + œÄ(m - k).We want the minimum |x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ|, so we can choose m and k such that œÄ(m - k) cancels out the œÄ/2 + œÜ as much as possible. Since œÜ is between 0 and œÄ/2, œÄ/2 + œÜ is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. So, the minimum difference would be œÄ/2 + œÜ - œÄ = œÜ - œÄ/2, but that would be negative, so absolute value would be œÄ/2 - œÜ.Wait, that doesn't make sense because œÄ/2 + œÜ is positive, and subtracting œÄ would make it negative. Maybe I should consider the smallest positive difference. Let me think differently.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the points where f(x) is maximum and g(x) is minimum, and find the x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ such that the difference is minimized.Let me set f(x‚ÇÅ) = 1 and g(x‚ÇÇ) = -1.So, x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4 + œÄk.x‚ÇÇ = 3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm.The difference x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = (3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm) - (œÄ/4 + œÄk) = œÄ/2 + œÜ + œÄ(m - k).To minimize |x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ|, we can choose m - k = -1, so that œÄ(m - k) = -œÄ. Then, x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/2 + œÜ - œÄ = œÜ - œÄ/2.But since œÜ is between 0 and œÄ/2, œÜ - œÄ/2 is negative, so |x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ| = œÄ/2 - œÜ.We are told that the minimum |x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ| is œÄ/3. So, œÄ/2 - œÜ = œÄ/3.Solving for œÜ: œÜ = œÄ/2 - œÄ/3 = (3œÄ/6 - 2œÄ/6) = œÄ/6.Wait, that seems to give œÜ = œÄ/6, which is option D. But let me check if this makes sense.If œÜ = œÄ/6, then the shift is œÄ/6 to the right. So, the function g(x) = sin(2x - œÄ/3).Now, let's check the points where f(x) = 1 and g(x) = -1.For f(x) = 1: x = œÄ/4 + œÄk.For g(x) = -1: 2x - œÄ/3 = 3œÄ/2 + 2œÄm ‚áí 2x = 3œÄ/2 + œÄ/3 + 2œÄm ‚áí 2x = 11œÄ/6 + 2œÄm ‚áí x = 11œÄ/12 + œÄm.So, x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4 = 3œÄ/12, and x‚ÇÇ = 11œÄ/12.The difference x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = 11œÄ/12 - 3œÄ/12 = 8œÄ/12 = 2œÄ/3.But the minimum difference is supposed to be œÄ/3, not 2œÄ/3. Hmm, that doesn't match.Wait, maybe I need to consider other points. Let's take k = 0 and m = 0.x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4, x‚ÇÇ = 11œÄ/12.Difference = 11œÄ/12 - œÄ/4 = 11œÄ/12 - 3œÄ/12 = 8œÄ/12 = 2œÄ/3.But if I take m = -1, then x‚ÇÇ = 11œÄ/12 - œÄ = -œÄ/12. The difference from x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4 is |-œÄ/12 - œÄ/4| = |-œÄ/12 - 3œÄ/12| = |-4œÄ/12| = œÄ/3. That's the minimum difference.So, yes, when m = -1, x‚ÇÇ = -œÄ/12, and x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4, the difference is œÄ/3. So, that works.Therefore, œÜ = œÄ/6 is correct.Wait, but earlier I thought the difference was œÄ/2 - œÜ, which gave œÜ = œÄ/6. But when I checked with specific points, I had to go to m = -1 to get the minimum difference. So, it still works out.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the general case.Let me think about the general solution.We have f(x) = sin(2x) and g(x) = sin(2x - 2œÜ).We need |f(x‚ÇÅ) - g(x‚ÇÇ)| = 2. As I thought earlier, this implies that one is 1 and the other is -1.So, either:1. f(x‚ÇÅ) = 1 and g(x‚ÇÇ) = -1, or2. f(x‚ÇÅ) = -1 and g(x‚ÇÇ) = 1.Let's consider both cases.Case 1: f(x‚ÇÅ) = 1 and g(x‚ÇÇ) = -1.So, sin(2x‚ÇÅ) = 1 ‚áí 2x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/2 + 2œÄk ‚áí x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4 + œÄk.sin(2x‚ÇÇ - 2œÜ) = -1 ‚áí 2x‚ÇÇ - 2œÜ = 3œÄ/2 + 2œÄm ‚áí x‚ÇÇ = 3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm.The difference x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = 3œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm - œÄ/4 - œÄk = œÄ/2 + œÜ + œÄ(m - k).To find the minimum |x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ|, we can choose m - k = -1, so œÄ(m - k) = -œÄ.Thus, x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/2 + œÜ - œÄ = œÜ - œÄ/2.But since œÜ is between 0 and œÄ/2, œÜ - œÄ/2 is negative, so |x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ| = œÄ/2 - œÜ.We are told that the minimum |x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ| is œÄ/3, so œÄ/2 - œÜ = œÄ/3 ‚áí œÜ = œÄ/2 - œÄ/3 = œÄ/6.Case 2: f(x‚ÇÅ) = -1 and g(x‚ÇÇ) = 1.Similarly, sin(2x‚ÇÅ) = -1 ‚áí 2x‚ÇÅ = 3œÄ/2 + 2œÄk ‚áí x‚ÇÅ = 3œÄ/4 + œÄk.sin(2x‚ÇÇ - 2œÜ) = 1 ‚áí 2x‚ÇÇ - 2œÜ = œÄ/2 + 2œÄm ‚áí x‚ÇÇ = œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm.The difference x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/4 + œÜ + œÄm - 3œÄ/4 - œÄk = -œÄ/2 + œÜ + œÄ(m - k).To minimize |x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ|, we can choose m - k = 1, so œÄ(m - k) = œÄ.Thus, x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = -œÄ/2 + œÜ + œÄ = œÜ + œÄ/2.But œÜ is between 0 and œÄ/2, so œÜ + œÄ/2 is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. The minimum |x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ| would be the smaller of œÜ + œÄ/2 and 2œÄ - (œÜ + œÄ/2) = 3œÄ/2 - œÜ. But since we are looking for the minimum, it's the smaller of these two.But wait, if we take m - k = 0, then x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ = -œÄ/2 + œÜ. Since œÜ is between 0 and œÄ/2, -œÄ/2 + œÜ is between -œÄ/2 and 0. So, |x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ| = œÄ/2 - œÜ, which is the same as in Case 1.Therefore, in both cases, the minimum |x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ| is œÄ/2 - œÜ, which is given as œÄ/3. So, solving œÄ/2 - œÜ = œÄ/3 gives œÜ = œÄ/6.Therefore, the correct answer is D: œÄ/6."},{"question":"The telephone company wants to add an area code composed of 2 letters to every phone number.

I need to figure out if it's monotonically increasing, decreasing, odd, or even. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, I notice that both terms have an x multiplied by some trigonometric functions. Maybe I can factor out the x? Let me try that:f(x) = x [sin 126¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞) + cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞)]Hmm, okay. Now, looking at the expression inside the brackets: sin 126¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞) + cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞). That looks familiar. It reminds me of the cosine addition formula, which is cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. Wait, is that right? Let me recall: yes, cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. So, if I can write the expression inside the brackets as cos(something), that might simplify things.Let me see: sin 126¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞) + cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞). So, comparing this to cos(A - B), which is cos A cos B + sin A sin B, it seems like A is 54¬∞ and B is (x - 36¬∞). Because cos 54¬∞ is multiplied by cos(x - 36¬∞), and sin 126¬∞ is multiplied by sin(x - 36¬∞). Wait, but sin 126¬∞, is that equal to sin(54¬∞)? Because 126¬∞ is 90¬∞ + 36¬∞, and sin(90¬∞ + Œ∏) = cos Œ∏. So, sin 126¬∞ = sin(90¬∞ + 36¬∞) = cos 36¬∞, right? Wait, no, sin(90¬∞ + Œ∏) is actually cos Œ∏, but with a sign. Wait, sin(90¬∞ + Œ∏) = cos Œ∏, but in this case, 126¬∞ is 90¬∞ + 36¬∞, so sin 126¬∞ = sin(90¬∞ + 36¬∞) = cos 36¬∞. So, sin 126¬∞ = cos 36¬∞. Hmm, okay.But in the expression, we have sin 126¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞) + cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞). So, if sin 126¬∞ = cos 36¬∞, then the expression becomes cos 36¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞) + cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞). Hmm, that's interesting. Now, I can think of this as cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞) + cos 36¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞). Wait, that looks like the cosine of a difference or something. Let me think.Wait, actually, the formula for cos(A - B) is cos A cos B + sin A sin B. But here, I have cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞) + cos 36¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞). So, if I let A = 54¬∞ and B = (x - 36¬∞), then cos(A - B) would be cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞) + sin 54¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞). But in our case, instead of sin 54¬∞, we have cos 36¬∞. Hmm, so that's different.Wait, but maybe I can relate cos 36¬∞ and sin 54¬∞. Let me recall that sin(54¬∞) = cos(36¬∞), because sin(Œ∏) = cos(90¬∞ - Œ∏). So, sin 54¬∞ = cos(36¬∞). Therefore, cos 36¬∞ = sin 54¬∞. So, in our expression, cos 36¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞) is the same as sin 54¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞). Therefore, the expression inside the brackets becomes cos 54¬∞ cos(x - 36¬∞) + sin 54¬∞ sin(x - 36¬∞). Ah, now that's exactly the formula for cos(A - B) where A = 54¬∞ and B = (x - 36¬∞). So, cos(54¬∞ - (x - 36¬∞)) = cos(54¬∞ - x + 36¬∞) = cos(90¬∞ - x).So, putting it all together, the expression inside the brackets simplifies to cos(90¬∞ - x). Therefore, f(x) = x cos(90¬∞ - x). But cos(90¬∞ - x) is equal to sin x, because cos(90¬∞ - Œ∏) = sin Œ∏. So, f(x) = x sin x.Wait, so f(x) simplifies to x sin x. That's a much simpler function. Now, I need to determine if this function is monotonically increasing, decreasing, odd, or even.First, let's recall what these terms mean. A function is monotonically increasing if its derivative is always non-negative, and monotonically decreasing if its derivative is always non-positive. An odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x), and an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x).So, let's check if f(x) = x sin x is even or odd. Let's compute f(-x):f(-x) = (-x) sin(-x) = (-x)(-sin x) = x sin x = f(x).So, f(-x) = f(x), which means f(x) is even. Therefore, option D is correct.But just to be thorough, let's check the other options as well. Is f(x) monotonically increasing or decreasing? Let's compute its derivative:f'(x) = d/dx [x sin x] = sin x + x cos x.Now, is this derivative always non-negative or non-positive? Let's see. The derivative is sin x + x cos x. The behavior of this derivative depends on the values of x. For example, when x = 0, f'(0) = 0 + 0 = 0. When x = œÄ/2, f'(œÄ/2) = 1 + (œÄ/2)(0) = 1 > 0. When x = œÄ, f'(œÄ) = 0 + œÄ(-1) = -œÄ < 0. So, the derivative changes sign, meaning the function is not always increasing or always decreasing. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.So, the only correct option is D: Even function."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=e^{x}(ax+b)-x^{2}-4x, the equation of the tangent line to the curve y=f(x) at the point (0, f(0)) is y=4x+4.(1) Find the values of a and b;(2) Determine the intervals of monotonicity for f(x) and find the maximum value of f(x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a function f(x) = e^x(ax + b) - x¬≤ - 4x. The question is in two parts: first, I need to find the values of a and b given that the tangent line at the point (0, f(0)) is y = 4x + 4. Second, I have to determine the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing and find its maximum value.Let me start with part (1). I remember that the equation of a tangent line at a point (x‚ÇÄ, f(x‚ÇÄ)) is given by y = f'(x‚ÇÄ)(x - x‚ÇÄ) + f(x‚ÇÄ). In this case, the point is (0, f(0)), so x‚ÇÄ is 0. The tangent line is given as y = 4x + 4, which means that the slope of the tangent line at x = 0 is 4, and the y-intercept is also 4. Therefore, f(0) must be equal to 4 because when x = 0, y = 4. Also, the derivative f'(0) should be equal to 4 because that's the slope of the tangent line.So, let's compute f(0). Plugging x = 0 into f(x):f(0) = e^0(a*0 + b) - 0¬≤ - 4*0 = 1*(0 + b) - 0 - 0 = b.Since f(0) = 4, that means b = 4.Now, let's find f'(x). The function f(x) is e^x(ax + b) - x¬≤ - 4x. To find the derivative, I'll use the product rule on the first term. The derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of (ax + b) is a. So, applying the product rule:f'(x) = e^x(ax + b) + e^x(a) - 2x - 4.Simplify that:f'(x) = e^x(ax + b + a) - 2x - 4.Now, evaluate f'(0):f'(0) = e^0(a*0 + b + a) - 2*0 - 4 = 1*(0 + b + a) - 0 - 4 = a + b - 4.We know that f'(0) = 4, so:a + b - 4 = 4.But we already found that b = 4, so substituting that in:a + 4 - 4 = 4 => a = 4.So, both a and b are 4.Wait, let me double-check that. If a = 4 and b = 4, then f(x) becomes e^x(4x + 4) - x¬≤ - 4x. Let's compute f(0):f(0) = e^0(0 + 4) - 0 - 0 = 1*4 = 4. That's correct.Now, f'(x) = e^x(4x + 4 + 4) - 2x - 4 = e^x(4x + 8) - 2x - 4. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me recast f'(x):Wait, no, the derivative should be f'(x) = e^x(ax + b) + e^x(a) - 2x - 4, which is e^x(ax + b + a) - 2x - 4. So, with a = 4 and b = 4, that becomes e^x(4x + 4 + 4) - 2x - 4 = e^x(4x + 8) - 2x - 4. Then, f'(0) is e^0(0 + 8) - 0 - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4. That's correct. So, my initial calculation was right.Okay, so part (1) is solved: a = 4 and b = 4.Moving on to part (2): Determine the intervals of monotonicity for f(x) and find the maximum value of f(x).First, let's write down f(x) with a and b known:f(x) = e^x(4x + 4) - x¬≤ - 4x.Simplify that:f(x) = 4e^x(x + 1) - x¬≤ - 4x.Now, to find the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing, we need to analyze its derivative f'(x). From part (1), we have:f'(x) = e^x(4x + 8) - 2x - 4.But wait, let me re-express f'(x) correctly. Earlier, I had:f'(x) = e^x(ax + b + a) - 2x - 4.With a = 4 and b = 4, that becomes:f'(x) = e^x(4x + 4 + 4) - 2x - 4 = e^x(4x + 8) - 2x - 4.Alternatively, factor 4 from the exponential term:f'(x) = 4e^x(x + 2) - 2x - 4.Hmm, maybe we can factor further. Let's see:f'(x) = 4e^x(x + 2) - 2(x + 2) = (4e^x - 2)(x + 2).Wait, that's a good point. Let me factor out (x + 2):f'(x) = (x + 2)(4e^x - 2).Yes, that's correct. So, f'(x) = (x + 2)(4e^x - 2).Now, to find critical points, set f'(x) = 0:(x + 2)(4e^x - 2) = 0.So, either x + 2 = 0 => x = -2, or 4e^x - 2 = 0 => 4e^x = 2 => e^x = 0.5 => x = ln(0.5) = -ln(2).So, the critical points are at x = -2 and x = -ln(2).Now, we need to determine the sign of f'(x) in the intervals determined by these critical points: (-‚àû, -2), (-2, -ln(2)), and (-ln(2), ‚àû).Let's test each interval.1. Interval (-‚àû, -2):Choose a test point, say x = -3.Compute f'(x):(x + 2) = -3 + 2 = -1 < 0.4e^x - 2: e^{-3} ‚âà 0.05, so 4*0.05 = 0.2, 0.2 - 2 = -1.8 < 0.So, f'(x) = (-1)*(-1.8) = positive.Therefore, f'(x) > 0 in (-‚àû, -2).2. Interval (-2, -ln(2)):Let's choose x = -1.5 (since ln(2) ‚âà 0.693, so -ln(2) ‚âà -0.693).Compute (x + 2) = -1.5 + 2 = 0.5 > 0.4e^x - 2: e^{-1.5} ‚âà 0.223, so 4*0.223 ‚âà 0.892, 0.892 - 2 ‚âà -1.108 < 0.Thus, f'(x) = (0.5)*(-1.108) ‚âà -0.554 < 0.So, f'(x) < 0 in (-2, -ln(2)).3. Interval (-ln(2), ‚àû):Choose x = 0.(x + 2) = 0 + 2 = 2 > 0.4e^x - 2: e^0 = 1, so 4*1 - 2 = 2 > 0.Thus, f'(x) = 2*2 = 4 > 0.Therefore, f'(x) > 0 in (-ln(2), ‚àû).So, summarizing:- f'(x) > 0 on (-‚àû, -2) and (-ln(2), ‚àû): function is increasing.- f'(x) < 0 on (-2, -ln(2)): function is decreasing.Therefore, the function increases on (-‚àû, -2) and (-ln(2), ‚àû), and decreases on (-2, -ln(2)).Now, to find the maximum value of f(x). Since the function changes from increasing to decreasing at x = -2, that point is a local maximum. Similarly, at x = -ln(2), the function changes from decreasing to increasing, so that's a local minimum.Therefore, the maximum value occurs at x = -2.Let's compute f(-2):f(-2) = 4e^{-2}(-2 + 1) - (-2)^2 - 4*(-2).Simplify:First term: 4e^{-2}(-1) = -4e^{-2}.Second term: -4.Third term: +8.So, f(-2) = -4e^{-2} - 4 + 8 = (-4e^{-2}) + 4.Factor out 4:f(-2) = 4(1 - e^{-2}).That's the maximum value.Let me verify the calculations:f(-2) = 4e^{-2}(-2 + 1) - (-2)^2 - 4*(-2) = 4e^{-2}(-1) - 4 + 8 = -4e^{-2} + 4.Yes, that's correct.So, the maximum value is 4(1 - e^{-2}).I think that's it. So, part (2) is solved.**Final Answer**(1) The values of ( a ) and ( b ) are (boxed{a = 4}) and (boxed{b = 4}).(2) The function ( f(x) ) is increasing on the intervals (boxed{(-infty, -2)}) and (boxed{(-ln 2, +infty)}), decreasing on the interval (boxed{(-2, -ln 2)}), and the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is (boxed{4(1 - e^{-2})})."},{"question":"In the given diagram, AB = 30 and angle ADB = 90^circ.

Let me try to visualize it first. There's a diagram with points A, B, C, D. AB is 30 units long, and angle ADB is 90 degrees. They also give me that cos A is 4/5 and sin C is 1/5. I need to find the length of DC.Hmm, let me try to sketch this in my mind. Point A is connected to B, which is connected to D, which is connected to C, and then back to A and B. So, A is at the origin, D is somewhere on the x-axis, B is above D, and C is further along the x-axis from D. The right angle is at D, so triangle ABD is a right triangle.Given that AB is 30 and angle ADB is 90 degrees, so triangle ABD is right-angled at D. They also give me cos A, which is 4/5. Cosine of angle A is adjacent over hypotenuse in triangle ABD. So, cos A = AD / AB. Since AB is 30, that means AD = AB * cos A = 30 * (4/5) = 24. Okay, so AD is 24.Now, since triangle ABD is a right triangle, I can find BD using the Pythagorean theorem. AB squared equals AD squared plus BD squared. So, BD squared equals AB squared minus AD squared. Plugging in the numbers: BD¬≤ = 30¬≤ - 24¬≤ = 900 - 576 = 324. Taking the square root, BD is 18. So, BD is 18 units.Now, looking at triangle BCD. They tell me that sin C is 1/5. Sin of angle C is opposite over hypotenuse in triangle BCD. So, sin C = BD / BC. Since BD is 18, that means 18 / BC = 1/5. Solving for BC, we get BC = 18 * 5 = 90. So, BC is 90 units.Now, to find DC, which is the other leg of triangle BCD. Again, using the Pythagorean theorem: BC¬≤ = BD¬≤ + DC¬≤. Plugging in the numbers: 90¬≤ = 18¬≤ + DC¬≤. So, 8100 = 324 + DC¬≤. Subtracting 324 from both sides: DC¬≤ = 8100 - 324 = 7776. Taking the square root of 7776, let me see. 7776 divided by 144 is 54, so sqrt(7776) is sqrt(144 * 54) = 12 * sqrt(54). Simplifying sqrt(54), which is sqrt(9*6) = 3*sqrt(6). So, 12*3*sqrt(6) = 36*sqrt(6). Wait, that doesn't seem right because 36 squared is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. Wait, no, actually, sqrt(7776) is 88.1816... Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying.Wait, let's see. 7776 divided by 144 is indeed 54, so sqrt(7776) is sqrt(144*54) = 12*sqrt(54). But sqrt(54) can be simplified further as sqrt(9*6) = 3*sqrt(6). So, 12*3*sqrt(6) is 36*sqrt(6). But 36*sqrt(6) squared is 36¬≤ * 6 = 1296 * 6 = 7776. So, that's correct. But wait, 36*sqrt(6) is approximately 36*2.449 ‚âà 88.164, which is approximately 88.164. But in the Asymptote code, they have C at (6*sqrt(5) + 50*sqrt(2), 0). So, DC is 50*sqrt(2). Wait, that's conflicting with my calculation.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the triangle. Let me double-check. So, in triangle BCD, angle C is at point C, which is on the x-axis. So, BD is opposite to angle C, and BC is the hypotenuse. So, sin C = BD / BC = 18 / BC = 1/5, so BC is 90. Then, DC is adjacent to angle C, so cos C would be DC / BC. But they didn't give me cos C, but maybe I can find it using sin¬≤ C + cos¬≤ C = 1. So, cos C = sqrt(1 - sin¬≤ C) = sqrt(1 - 1/25) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5. Therefore, DC = BC * cos C = 90 * (2*sqrt(6)/5) = (180*sqrt(6))/5 = 36*sqrt(6). So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.But in the Asymptote code, DC is 50*sqrt(2). Hmm, that's different. Maybe I misinterpreted the diagram. Let me look again. The Asymptote code defines point D at (6*sqrt(5), 0), and point C at (6*sqrt(5) + 50*sqrt(2), 0). So, DC is 50*sqrt(2). But according to my calculations, it's 36*sqrt(6). Wait, 36*sqrt(6) is approximately 88.18, and 50*sqrt(2) is approximately 70.71. These are different. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.Wait, let me check the Asymptote code again. It defines point B at (6*sqrt(5), 24). So, AB is from (0,0) to (6*sqrt(5),24). Let me calculate AB's length. The distance between (0,0) and (6*sqrt(5),24) is sqrt[(6*sqrt(5))¬≤ + 24¬≤] = sqrt[36*5 + 576] = sqrt[180 + 576] = sqrt[756]. Wait, sqrt(756) is sqrt(36*21) = 6*sqrt(21), which is approximately 6*4.583 = 27.5. But the problem states AB is 30. So, that's conflicting. Therefore, the Asymptote code might not be to scale, or perhaps the coordinates are illustrative.So, maybe I shouldn't rely on the Asymptote code's coordinates but just go by the given information. So, AB is 30, angle ADB is 90 degrees, cos A is 4/5, sin C is 1/5. So, let's proceed again.In triangle ABD, right-angled at D, AB is 30, cos A is 4/5, so AD is 24, BD is 18. Then, in triangle BCD, sin C is 1/5, so BD/BC = 1/5, so BC is 90. Then, DC is sqrt(BC¬≤ - BD¬≤) = sqrt(8100 - 324) = sqrt(7776) = 36*sqrt(6). So, DC is 36*sqrt(6). But in the Asymptote code, DC is 50*sqrt(2), which is approximately 70.71, while 36*sqrt(6) is approximately 88.18. So, there's a discrepancy.Wait, maybe I misapplied the sine function. Let me think again. In triangle BCD, angle C is at point C, so the sides are: opposite to angle C is BD, adjacent is DC, and hypotenuse is BC. So, sin C = opposite / hypotenuse = BD / BC = 18 / BC = 1/5, so BC = 90. Then, cos C = DC / BC, so DC = BC * cos C. We can find cos C from sin C: cos C = sqrt(1 - sin¬≤ C) = sqrt(1 - 1/25) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5. Therefore, DC = 90 * (2*sqrt(6)/5) = (180*sqrt(6))/5 = 36*sqrt(6). So, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not right-angled at D for triangle BCD? Wait, no, angle ADB is 90 degrees, but triangle BCD is not necessarily right-angled. Wait, in the Asymptote code, D is connected to B, which is connected to A, which is connected to C, which is connected back to B. So, the only right angle is at D in triangle ABD. So, triangle BCD is not necessarily right-angled. Wait, but in my previous assumption, I considered triangle BCD as right-angled, but that might not be the case.Wait, hold on. If triangle BCD is not right-angled, then I can't use the Pythagorean theorem directly. So, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think.We have points A, B, D, C. A is at (0,0), D is at (x,0), B is at (x,y), and C is at (x + z, 0). So, AB is 30, angle ADB is 90 degrees, cos A is 4/5, sin C is 1/5. So, maybe I can assign coordinates and solve using coordinate geometry.Let me assign coordinates: Let‚Äôs place point A at (0,0). Since angle ADB is 90 degrees, point D must be somewhere on the x-axis, say at (d, 0). Point B is somewhere in the plane, forming a right angle at D. So, coordinates of B would be (d, b), since AD is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (d,0), and BD is vertical from (d,0) to (d,b). Then, AB is the hypotenuse from (0,0) to (d,b), which has length 30.Given that cos A is 4/5, which is the cosine of angle at A. In triangle ABD, cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse = AD / AB = d / 30 = 4/5. Therefore, d = 30*(4/5) = 24. So, AD is 24, so point D is at (24,0). Then, BD is the vertical side, so length BD can be found using Pythagoras: AB¬≤ = AD¬≤ + BD¬≤ => 30¬≤ = 24¬≤ + BD¬≤ => 900 = 576 + BD¬≤ => BD¬≤ = 324 => BD = 18. So, point B is at (24,18).Now, point C is on the x-axis to the right of D, so its coordinates are (24 + c, 0), where c is the length DC, which we need to find. So, DC = c, and AC is from (0,0) to (24 + c, 0), so AC is 24 + c. But wait, in the diagram, point C is connected to B, so BC is a line from (24,18) to (24 + c, 0). The length of BC can be found using the distance formula: BC = sqrt[(c)^2 + (18)^2] = sqrt(c¬≤ + 324).Given that sin C is 1/5. Angle C is at point C, which is at (24 + c, 0). So, in triangle BCD, angle at C. Wait, triangle BCD has points B(24,18), C(24 + c, 0), and D(24,0). So, triangle BCD is a right triangle? Wait, no, because point D is at (24,0), point C is at (24 + c, 0), and point B is at (24,18). So, triangle BCD is actually a right triangle at D, because BD is vertical and DC is horizontal. Wait, but angle at C is not necessarily 90 degrees. Wait, no, in triangle BCD, the sides are BC, CD, and BD. So, BD is 18, CD is c, and BC is sqrt(c¬≤ + 324). So, in triangle BCD, angle at C is given, with sin C = 1/5.So, in triangle BCD, sin C = opposite / hypotenuse = BD / BC = 18 / sqrt(c¬≤ + 324) = 1/5. So, 18 / sqrt(c¬≤ + 324) = 1/5. Cross-multiplying, sqrt(c¬≤ + 324) = 90. Squaring both sides, c¬≤ + 324 = 8100. Therefore, c¬≤ = 8100 - 324 = 7776. So, c = sqrt(7776). Simplifying sqrt(7776): 7776 divided by 144 is 54, so sqrt(7776) = sqrt(144*54) = 12*sqrt(54). Simplify sqrt(54): sqrt(9*6) = 3*sqrt(6). So, 12*3*sqrt(6) = 36*sqrt(6). Therefore, DC = 36*sqrt(6).Wait, but in the Asymptote code, DC is given as 50*sqrt(2). So, why is there a discrepancy? Maybe the Asymptote code is just an example and not to scale, or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me double-check my steps.1. Assigned coordinates correctly: A(0,0), D(24,0), B(24,18), C(24 + c, 0).2. Calculated AB correctly: distance from (0,0) to (24,18) is sqrt(24¬≤ + 18¬≤) = sqrt(576 + 324) = sqrt(900) = 30. Correct.3. Calculated BD as 18, correct.4. In triangle BCD, sin C = BD / BC = 18 / sqrt(c¬≤ + 324) = 1/5. Solved for c: sqrt(c¬≤ + 324) = 90 => c¬≤ = 7776 => c = 36*sqrt(6). That seems correct.So, unless there's a different interpretation of the diagram, I think my answer is correct. The Asymptote code might have different coordinates for illustrative purposes, but the calculations based on the given information lead to DC = 36*sqrt(6).Wait, but in the initial problem, the Asymptote code defines D at (6*sqrt(5),0) and C at (6*sqrt(5) + 50*sqrt(2),0). So, DC is 50*sqrt(2). But according to my calculations, DC should be 36*sqrt(6). Let me see if 36*sqrt(6) is equal to 50*sqrt(2). Calculating both:36*sqrt(6) ‚âà 36*2.449 ‚âà 88.16450*sqrt(2) ‚âà 50*1.414 ‚âà 70.7These are different. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is incorrect, or I misinterpreted the problem.Wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says AB = 30, angle ADB = 90 degrees, cos A = 4/5, sin C = 1/5. So, my calculations are based on that. The Asymptote code might have a different configuration, but the problem statement is clear. So, I think my answer is correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D, but the Asymptote code is 2D. No, the Asymptote code is 2D. So, I think my answer is correct, and the Asymptote code might have a typo or is just an example.So, to summarize:1. In triangle ABD, right-angled at D, AB = 30, cos A = 4/5, so AD = 24, BD = 18.2. In triangle BCD, sin C = 1/5, so BD / BC = 1/5 => BC = 90.3.

If the sequence {b_n} satisfies b_n=10-log_2a_n, then the value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {b_n} is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about two sequences, {a_n} and {b_n}. Let me try to understand what it's asking. First, it says that the sum of the first n terms of {a_n} is S_n, and that S_n equals 2a_n minus 2. So, S_n = 2a_n - 2. Hmm, interesting. Then, there's another sequence {b_n} where each term is defined as 10 minus the logarithm base 2 of a_n. So, b_n = 10 - log‚ÇÇ(a_n). The question is asking for the value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}. Alright, let's break this down step by step. Maybe if I can figure out what the sequence {a_n} looks like, I can then figure out {b_n} and find the n that gives the maximum sum.Starting with the first part: S_n = 2a_n - 2. S_n is the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}, so S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n. When n = 1, S_1 should just be a_1, right? So plugging n = 1 into the equation: S_1 = 2a_1 - 2. But S_1 is also a_1, so:a_1 = 2a_1 - 2Let me solve for a_1:a_1 = 2a_1 - 2  Subtract a_1 from both sides:  0 = a_1 - 2  So, a_1 = 2.Alright, got the first term. Now, what about the next terms? For n ‚â• 2, S_n = 2a_n - 2. Also, S_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} - 2. Since S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n, I can write:S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n  But S_n is also 2a_n - 2, and S_{n-1} is 2a_{n-1} - 2. So:2a_n - 2 = (2a_{n-1} - 2) + a_nLet me simplify this equation:2a_n - 2 = 2a_{n-1} - 2 + a_n  Subtract a_n from both sides:  a_n - 2 = 2a_{n-1} - 2  Add 2 to both sides:  a_n = 2a_{n-1}Oh, so each term is twice the previous term. That means {a_n} is a geometric sequence with common ratio 2. Since a_1 is 2, then a_n = 2^n. Let me check that:a_1 = 2^1 = 2  a_2 = 2^2 = 4  a_3 = 2^3 = 8  And so on. That seems to fit.So, a_n = 2^n. Now, moving on to {b_n}. Each term is defined as 10 - log‚ÇÇ(a_n). Since a_n is 2^n, log‚ÇÇ(a_n) is log‚ÇÇ(2^n) which is just n. So, b_n = 10 - n.Wait, so b_n is just 10 minus n? That simplifies things. So, the sequence {b_n} is 10, 9, 8, 7, ..., decreasing by 1 each time. Now, the problem is asking for the value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}. So, I need to find the n where the sum S'_n = b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n is the largest.Since {b_n} is a decreasing sequence starting at 10 and going down by 1 each time, the terms are positive until n=10, where b_10 = 0. After that, for n > 10, b_n becomes negative. So, the sum S'_n will increase as long as the terms are positive or zero, and then start decreasing once we add negative terms.Therefore, the maximum sum should occur either at n=10 or just before the terms become negative. Let me calculate the sum S'_n.Since b_n = 10 - n, the sum of the first n terms is:S'_n = sum_{k=1}^n (10 - k)This is an arithmetic series where the first term is 9 (since when k=1, 10 -1=9) and the last term is 10 - n. Wait, actually, let me correct that. When k=1, b_1 = 10 -1=9? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, b_n = 10 - n, so when n=1, b_1=10 -1=9? Wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier I thought a_1=2, so b_1=10 - log‚ÇÇ(2)=10 -1=9. So, yes, b_1=9, b_2=8, b_3=7,..., b_10=0, b_11=-1, etc.So, actually, the first term of {b_n} is 9, not 10. Wait, hold on, let me double-check. Given that a_n = 2^n, so log‚ÇÇ(a_n)=n, so b_n=10 - n. So, when n=1, b_1=10 -1=9; when n=2, b_2=10 -2=8; yes, that's correct. So, the first term is 9, not 10. So, the sequence {b_n} is 9,8,7,...,0,-1,...Therefore, the sum S'_n is the sum from k=1 to n of (10 - k). Let me compute this sum.S'_n = sum_{k=1}^n (10 - k)  = sum_{k=1}^n 10 - sum_{k=1}^n k  = 10n - (n(n + 1))/2So, S'_n = 10n - (n¬≤ + n)/2  = (20n - n¬≤ - n)/2  = (19n - n¬≤)/2  = (-n¬≤ + 19n)/2So, S'_n is a quadratic function in terms of n: (-n¬≤ + 19n)/2. Since the coefficient of n¬≤ is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the maximum occurs at the vertex.The vertex of a parabola given by f(n) = an¬≤ + bn + c is at n = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -1/2, b = 19/2.So, n = -(19/2)/(2*(-1/2))  = -(19/2)/(-1)  = 19/2  = 9.5Since n must be an integer, the maximum occurs at n=9 or n=10.Let me compute S'_9 and S'_10 to see which one is larger.First, S'_9:S'_9 = (-9¬≤ + 19*9)/2  = (-81 + 171)/2  = (90)/2  = 45Now, S'_10:S'_10 = (-10¬≤ + 19*10)/2  = (-100 + 190)/2  = (90)/2  = 45So, both S'_9 and S'_10 are equal to 45. Therefore, the maximum sum occurs at both n=9 and n=10.But wait, let me think again. Since b_n is 10 - n, when n=10, b_10=0. So, adding b_10 doesn't change the sum. Therefore, the sum remains the same at n=9 and n=10. So, both are valid answers.But the question says \\"the value of n that maximizes the sum\\". So, it's possible that both 9 and 10 are correct. However, sometimes problems expect the smallest such n or the largest, but in this case, since both give the same maximum sum, both are correct.Wait, but let me check the sum again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating S'_n.Wait, S'_n = sum_{k=1}^n (10 - k). So, when n=1, it's 9; n=2, 9+8=17; n=3, 17+7=24; n=4, 24+6=30; n=5, 30+5=35; n=6, 35+4=39; n=7, 39+3=42; n=8, 42+2=44; n=9, 44+1=45; n=10, 45+0=45; n=11, 45 + (-1)=44; and so on.Yes, so at n=9, the sum is 45, and at n=10, it's still 45. So, both are correct. So, the answer is either 9 or 10.But let me check the initial problem statement again to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.\\"Given a sequence {a_n} whose sum of the first n terms is S_n, and it satisfies S_n=2a_n-2. If the sequence {b_n} satisfies b_n=10 - log‚ÇÇa_n, then the value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {b_n} is ______.\\"So, yeah, seems like I interpreted it correctly. So, the answer is either 9 or 10.But wait, in the initial problem, when n=1, S_1=2a_1 -2, which gave a_1=2. Then, for n‚â•2, a_n=2a_{n-1}, so a_n=2^n. Therefore, b_n=10 - log‚ÇÇ(2^n)=10 -n. So, b_n=10 -n, which is correct.So, the sum S'_n is indeed (-n¬≤ +19n)/2, which peaks at n=9.5, so n=9 or 10.Therefore, the answer is either 9 or 10.But in the problem statement, it's asking for \\"the value of n\\", so maybe both are acceptable. Alternatively, sometimes problems expect the smallest n, but in this case, both give the same sum.Wait, let me think about the sequence {b_n}. The terms are positive until n=9, since b_9=1, and b_10=0. So, adding b_10 doesn't increase the sum, but doesn't decrease it either. So, the maximum sum is achieved at both n=9 and n=10.Therefore, the answer is either 9 or 10.But in the initial solution, the assistant wrote \\"the value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {b_n} is either 9 or 10.\\" So, that seems correct.Wait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \\"the value of n that maximizes the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {b_n} is ______.\\" So, maybe they expect a single answer, but in reality, both 9 and 10 give the same maximum sum. So, both are correct.Alternatively, sometimes in such problems, the maximum is achieved at the integer part of the vertex, which is 9, and 10 is just equal. So, maybe 9 is the answer. But in reality, since both give the same sum, both are correct.But in the initial solution, the assistant wrote \\"the answer is: boxed{9 text{ or } 10}.\\" So, that seems correct.But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with S_n=2a_n -2.For n=1: S_1=a_1=2a_1 -2 => a_1=2.For n=2: S_2=a_1 + a_2=2a_2 -2. Since a_1=2, 2 + a_2=2a_2 -2 => 2 + a_2=2a_2 -2 => 2 +2=2a_2 -a_2 => 4=a_2.Similarly, a_2=4=2^2.For n=3: S_3=a_1 +a_2 +a_3=2a_3 -2. So, 2 +4 +a_3=2a_3 -2 =>6 +a_3=2a_3 -2 =>6 +2=2a_3 -a_3 =>8=a_3=2^3.So, yes, a_n=2^n.Therefore, b_n=10 - log‚ÇÇ(2^n)=10 -n.So, b_n=10 -n.Sum of first n terms: S'_n= sum_{k=1}^n (10 -k)=10n - sum_{k=1}^n k=10n -n(n+1)/2.Which simplifies to (-n¬≤ +19n)/2.Vertex at n=19/2=9.5.So, maximum at n=9 or 10.Therefore, the answer is 9 or 10.Yes, that seems correct.**Final Answer**The value of ( n ) that maximizes the sum of the first ( n ) terms of the sequence ( {b_n} ) is boxed{9} or boxed{10}.But since the problem asks for \\"the value of ( n )\\", and both 9 and 10 give the same maximum sum, it's appropriate to present both answers. However, if only one answer is expected, it might be 9, as it's the first integer where the maximum is achieved. But given the calculations, both are correct.But in the initial solution, the assistant wrote \\"the answer is: boxed{9 text{ or } 10}.\\" So, to be precise, I think both are acceptable. But in the final answer, since the user might expect a single box, maybe we can write both inside one box.Alternatively, sometimes in such cases, people write both numbers separated by a comma or \\"or\\". So, to follow the initial solution, I'll put both in one box with \\"or\\".**Final Answer**boxed{9 text{ or } 10}"},{"question":"Given that the line 2x+y-2=0 is parallel to the line 4x+my+6=0, the distance between them is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"Given that the line 2x + y - 2 = 0 is parallel to the line 4x + my + 6 = 0, the distance between them is ______.\\" Hmm, I need to find the distance between these two parallel lines. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. So, I should probably find the slopes of both lines and set them equal to each other to find the value of m. Once I have m, I can then use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines.Let me start by finding the slope of the first line, 2x + y - 2 = 0. To find the slope, I can rewrite this equation in slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope.So, starting with 2x + y - 2 = 0, I can subtract 2x and add 2 to both sides:y = -2x + 2Okay, so the slope (m1) of the first line is -2.Now, let's find the slope of the second line, which is 4x + my + 6 = 0. I'll do the same thing and rewrite it in slope-intercept form.Starting with 4x + my + 6 = 0, I can subtract 4x and 6 from both sides:my = -4x - 6Now, to solve for y, I divide both sides by m:y = (-4/m)x - 6/mSo, the slope (m2) of the second line is -4/m.Since the lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Therefore, I can set m1 equal to m2:-2 = -4/mHmm, let me solve for m. Multiply both sides by m to get rid of the denominator:-2m = -4Now, divide both sides by -2:m = (-4)/(-2) = 2Okay, so m is 2. That means the second line is 4x + 2y + 6 = 0.Wait, let me double-check that. If m is 2, then the second line becomes 4x + 2y + 6 = 0. Let me confirm if this is indeed parallel to the first line.The first line is 2x + y - 2 = 0, which we already converted to y = -2x + 2. The second line, 4x + 2y + 6 = 0, can be rewritten as:2y = -4x - 6Divide both sides by 2:y = -2x - 3Yes, the slope is -2, which matches the first line. So, they are indeed parallel. Good.Now, I need to find the distance between these two parallel lines. I remember there's a formula for the distance between two parallel lines. Let me recall it.The formula for the distance (d) between two parallel lines Ax + By + C1 = 0 and Ax + By + C2 = 0 is:d = |C1 - C2| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2)Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. I think it's the absolute difference of the constants divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients of x and y.But in this case, the two lines are:First line: 2x + y - 2 = 0Second line: 4x + 2y + 6 = 0Hmm, but in the formula, both lines need to be in the same form, right? They should have the same coefficients for x and y. Let me check.The first line is 2x + y - 2 = 0. The second line is 4x + 2y + 6 = 0. I notice that the second line is just twice the first line, except for the constant term. Let me see:If I multiply the first line by 2, I get 4x + 2y - 4 = 0. Comparing this to the second line, which is 4x + 2y + 6 = 0, the coefficients of x and y are the same, but the constants are different. So, that's good because they are parallel.So, to apply the distance formula, I need both lines in the form Ax + By + C1 = 0 and Ax + By + C2 = 0. So, I can write the first line as 4x + 2y - 4 = 0 and the second line as 4x + 2y + 6 = 0.Wait, but the original first line was 2x + y - 2 = 0. If I multiply it by 2, it becomes 4x + 2y - 4 = 0. So, that's correct.So, now, both lines are:Line 1: 4x + 2y - 4 = 0Line 2: 4x + 2y + 6 = 0Now, applying the distance formula:d = |C1 - C2| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2)Where A = 4, B = 2, C1 = -4, and C2 = 6.So, plugging in the values:d = |-4 - 6| / sqrt(4^2 + 2^2)First, compute the numerator:|-4 - 6| = |-10| = 10Then, compute the denominator:sqrt(16 + 4) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5)So, d = 10 / (2*sqrt(5)) = 5 / sqrt(5)Simplify that:5 / sqrt(5) = sqrt(5) because 5 divided by sqrt(5) is sqrt(5).Wait, let me confirm:sqrt(5) * sqrt(5) = 5, so 5 / sqrt(5) = sqrt(5). Yes, that's correct.So, the distance between the two lines is sqrt(5).Alternatively, I can rationalize the denominator:5 / sqrt(5) = (5 * sqrt(5)) / (sqrt(5) * sqrt(5)) = (5*sqrt(5))/5 = sqrt(5)Same result.Alternatively, if I didn't adjust the first line by multiplying by 2, would I get the same distance?Let me try that. The original lines are:Line 1: 2x + y - 2 = 0Line 2: 4x + 2y + 6 = 0But to use the distance formula, I need the coefficients of x and y to be the same. So, I can either multiply the first line by 2 or divide the second line by 2.If I divide the second line by 2, it becomes 2x + y + 3 = 0.So, now, both lines are:Line 1: 2x + y - 2 = 0Line 2: 2x + y + 3 = 0Now, applying the distance formula:d = |C1 - C2| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2)Where A = 2, B = 1, C1 = -2, C2 = 3.So, d = |-2 - 3| / sqrt(2^2 + 1^2) = |-5| / sqrt(4 + 1) = 5 / sqrt(5) = sqrt(5)Same result. So, either way, the distance is sqrt(5).Wait, so regardless of whether I scale the equation or not, as long as I adjust the constants accordingly, I get the same distance. That makes sense because scaling the equation doesn't change the line itself, just the coefficients.So, in summary, the steps are:1. Find the slopes of both lines by converting them to slope-intercept form.2. Set the slopes equal since the lines are parallel and solve for m.3. Once m is found, rewrite both lines in a form where their coefficients of x and y are the same.4. Use the distance formula for parallel lines, which is |C1 - C2| divided by the square root of (A squared plus B squared).5. Simplify the result to get the distance.I think that covers it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, slope of first line: -2.Second line slope: -4/m.Set equal: -2 = -4/m => m = 2.Second line becomes 4x + 2y + 6 = 0.Convert first line to same coefficients: 4x + 2y - 4 = 0.Distance formula: |(-4) - 6| / sqrt(16 + 4) = 10 / sqrt(20) = 10 / (2*sqrt(5)) = 5 / sqrt(5) = sqrt(5).Alternatively, divide second line by 2: 2x + y + 3 = 0.Distance formula: |-2 - 3| / sqrt(4 + 1) = 5 / sqrt(5) = sqrt(5).Both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that sqrt(5) is correct.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The distance between the two parallel lines is boxed{sqrt{5}}."},{"question":"A case of 12 rolls of paper towels sells for 9.

The problem says that (1 + 3i) multiplied by z is a purely imaginary number. Then, œâ is defined as z divided by (2 + i), and the magnitude of œâ is 5 times the square root of 2. I need to find the complex number œâ.First, I remember that a complex number is purely imaginary if its real part is zero. So, if (1 + 3i) * z is purely imaginary, that means the real part of that product must be zero. Let me write that down.Let me denote z as m + ni, where m and n are real numbers. So, z = m + ni.Now, let's compute (1 + 3i) * z. That would be (1 + 3i)(m + ni). Let me multiply this out:(1)(m) + (1)(ni) + (3i)(m) + (3i)(ni)= m + ni + 3mi + 3n i¬≤But since i¬≤ = -1, this becomes:= m + ni + 3mi - 3n= (m - 3n) + (n + 3m)iSo, the real part is (m - 3n) and the imaginary part is (n + 3m)i.Since the product is purely imaginary, the real part must be zero. So, m - 3n = 0. That gives me the equation:m = 3nOkay, so that's one equation. Now, let's move on to œâ. œâ is given as z divided by (2 + i). So, œâ = z / (2 + i). Let me substitute z = m + ni into this:œâ = (m + ni) / (2 + i)To simplify this, I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (2 - i). That way, the denominator becomes a real number.So, œâ = [(m + ni)(2 - i)] / [(2 + i)(2 - i)]Let me compute the denominator first:(2 + i)(2 - i) = 2*2 + 2*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i)= 4 - 2i + 2i - i¬≤= 4 - i¬≤= 4 - (-1)= 5So, the denominator is 5. Now, let's compute the numerator:(m + ni)(2 - i) = m*2 + m*(-i) + ni*2 + ni*(-i)= 2m - mi + 2ni - n i¬≤Again, since i¬≤ = -1, this becomes:= 2m - mi + 2ni + n= (2m + n) + (-m + 2n)iSo, putting it all together, œâ is:[(2m + n) + (-m + 2n)i] / 5Which can be written as:(2m + n)/5 + [(-m + 2n)/5]iNow, the magnitude of œâ is given as 5‚àö2. The magnitude of a complex number a + bi is ‚àö(a¬≤ + b¬≤). So, let's compute the magnitude of œâ:|œâ| = ‚àö[( (2m + n)/5 )¬≤ + ( (-m + 2n)/5 )¬≤] = 5‚àö2Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:[(2m + n)¬≤ + (-m + 2n)¬≤] / 25 = (5‚àö2)¬≤[(2m + n)¬≤ + (-m + 2n)¬≤] / 25 = 25 * 2[(2m + n)¬≤ + (-m + 2n)¬≤] / 25 = 50Multiply both sides by 25:(2m + n)¬≤ + (-m + 2n)¬≤ = 1250Now, let's expand both squares:First, (2m + n)¬≤ = 4m¬≤ + 4mn + n¬≤Second, (-m + 2n)¬≤ = m¬≤ - 4mn + 4n¬≤Adding them together:4m¬≤ + 4mn + n¬≤ + m¬≤ - 4mn + 4n¬≤ = 1250Combine like terms:(4m¬≤ + m¬≤) + (4mn - 4mn) + (n¬≤ + 4n¬≤) = 12505m¬≤ + 0 + 5n¬≤ = 1250So, 5m¬≤ + 5n¬≤ = 1250Divide both sides by 5:m¬≤ + n¬≤ = 250Okay, so now I have two equations:1) m = 3n2) m¬≤ + n¬≤ = 250Let me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.Since m = 3n, substitute into m¬≤ + n¬≤:(3n)¬≤ + n¬≤ = 2509n¬≤ + n¬≤ = 25010n¬≤ = 250n¬≤ = 25n = ¬±5So, n can be 5 or -5.Then, m = 3n, so:If n = 5, m = 15If n = -5, m = -15So, we have two possibilities for z:1) z = 15 + 5i2) z = -15 - 5iNow, let's find œâ for each case.First, case 1: z = 15 + 5iœâ = (15 + 5i) / (2 + i)Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - i):œâ = [(15 + 5i)(2 - i)] / 5Compute numerator:15*2 + 15*(-i) + 5i*2 + 5i*(-i)= 30 - 15i + 10i - 5i¬≤= 30 - 5i + 5 (since i¬≤ = -1)= 35 - 5iSo, œâ = (35 - 5i)/5 = 7 - iSecond, case 2: z = -15 - 5iœâ = (-15 - 5i) / (2 + i)Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - i):œâ = [(-15 - 5i)(2 - i)] / 5Compute numerator:-15*2 + (-15)*(-i) + (-5i)*2 + (-5i)*(-i)= -30 + 15i - 10i + 5i¬≤= -30 + 5i - 5 (since i¬≤ = -1)= -35 + 5iSo, œâ = (-35 + 5i)/5 = -7 + iTherefore, the possible values for œâ are 7 - i and -7 + i.Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with (1 + 3i)z being purely imaginary. We set z = m + ni, multiplied it out, and found that m = 3n. Then, using œâ = z / (2 + i), we expressed œâ in terms of m and n, found the magnitude condition, which led us to m¬≤ + n¬≤ = 250. Substituting m = 3n into that gave us n = ¬±5, hence m = ¬±15. Then, substituting back into œâ, we got 7 - i and -7 + i.Everything seems to check out. So, the complex numbers œâ are 7 - i and -7 + i."},{"question":"Find ( f: mathbf{R} rightarrow mathbf{R} ) such that for any ( x, y in mathbf{R} ), the following equation holds: [ f(x^2 - y^2) = (x - y)(f(x) + f(y)). ]","answer":"Okay, so I have this functional equation to solve: ( f(x^2 - y^2) = (x - y)(f(x) + f(y)) ) for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ). Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I should probably plug in some specific values for ( x ) and ( y ) to see if I can find any patterns or figure out properties of the function ( f ). A common strategy is to set ( x = y ) because that often simplifies the equation.So, if I let ( x = y ), the left side becomes ( f(x^2 - x^2) = f(0) ). The right side becomes ( (x - x)(f(x) + f(x)) = 0 times (2f(x)) = 0 ). So, from this, I can conclude that ( f(0) = 0 ). That's a good start.Next, maybe I can set one of the variables to zero to see what happens. Let's try ( y = 0 ). Then the equation becomes ( f(x^2 - 0) = (x - 0)(f(x) + f(0)) ). Simplifying, that's ( f(x^2) = x(f(x) + 0) = x f(x) ). So, ( f(x^2) = x f(x) ). Interesting, that's a useful relation.What if I set ( x = 0 ) instead? Then the equation becomes ( f(0 - y^2) = (0 - y)(f(0) + f(y)) ). Simplifying, ( f(-y^2) = (-y)(0 + f(y)) = -y f(y) ). So, ( f(-y^2) = -y f(y) ). Hmm, that's another relation.Wait, from ( f(x^2) = x f(x) ), if I replace ( x ) with ( -x ), I get ( f((-x)^2) = (-x) f(-x) ). But ( (-x)^2 = x^2 ), so ( f(x^2) = -x f(-x) ). But we already have ( f(x^2) = x f(x) ). So, combining these two, ( x f(x) = -x f(-x) ). If ( x neq 0 ), we can divide both sides by ( x ), getting ( f(x) = -f(-x) ). So, ( f ) is an odd function. That's a useful property.Okay, so ( f ) is odd. That might help later. Let me see if I can find more properties or maybe even guess the form of ( f ).Another idea is to set ( y = 1 ) and see what happens. Let's try that. So, set ( y = 1 ), then the equation becomes ( f(x^2 - 1) = (x - 1)(f(x) + f(1)) ). Hmm, that relates ( f(x^2 - 1) ) to ( f(x) ) and ( f(1) ). Maybe I can use this to find a recursive relation or something.Similarly, if I set ( y = -1 ), the equation becomes ( f(x^2 - 1) = (x + 1)(f(x) + f(-1)) ). But since ( f ) is odd, ( f(-1) = -f(1) ). So, this becomes ( f(x^2 - 1) = (x + 1)(f(x) - f(1)) ).Now, I have two expressions for ( f(x^2 - 1) ):1. ( f(x^2 - 1) = (x - 1)(f(x) + f(1)) )2. ( f(x^2 - 1) = (x + 1)(f(x) - f(1)) )Since both equal ( f(x^2 - 1) ), I can set them equal to each other:( (x - 1)(f(x) + f(1)) = (x + 1)(f(x) - f(1)) )Let me expand both sides:Left side: ( (x - 1)f(x) + (x - 1)f(1) )Right side: ( (x + 1)f(x) - (x + 1)f(1) )So, expanding:Left: ( x f(x) - f(x) + x f(1) - f(1) )Right: ( x f(x) + f(x) - x f(1) - f(1) )Now, set them equal:( x f(x) - f(x) + x f(1) - f(1) = x f(x) + f(x) - x f(1) - f(1) )Let me subtract ( x f(x) ) from both sides:( -f(x) + x f(1) - f(1) = f(x) - x f(1) - f(1) )Now, bring all terms to one side:( -f(x) + x f(1) - f(1) - f(x) + x f(1) + f(1) = 0 )Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me try again.Starting from:( x f(x) - f(x) + x f(1) - f(1) = x f(x) + f(x) - x f(1) - f(1) )Subtract ( x f(x) ) from both sides:( -f(x) + x f(1) - f(1) = f(x) - x f(1) - f(1) )Now, bring all terms to the left side:( -f(x) + x f(1) - f(1) - f(x) + x f(1) + f(1) = 0 )Combine like terms:- ( -f(x) - f(x) = -2f(x) )- ( x f(1) + x f(1) = 2x f(1) )- ( -f(1) + f(1) = 0 )So, we have:( -2f(x) + 2x f(1) = 0 )Divide both sides by 2:( -f(x) + x f(1) = 0 )Which simplifies to:( f(x) = x f(1) )Oh! So, ( f(x) ) is a linear function of the form ( f(x) = kx ), where ( k = f(1) ). That seems promising.Let me check if this function satisfies the original equation. Let ( f(x) = kx ). Then, the left side:( f(x^2 - y^2) = k(x^2 - y^2) )The right side:( (x - y)(f(x) + f(y)) = (x - y)(kx + ky) = (x - y)k(x + y) = k(x^2 - y^2) )So, both sides are equal. Therefore, ( f(x) = kx ) satisfies the equation for any constant ( k ).Wait, but I should also check if there are any other possible solutions. Is ( f(x) = kx ) the only solution?From the steps above, when I set ( y = 1 ) and ( y = -1 ), I derived that ( f(x) = x f(1) ). So, unless there's a step where I assumed something that might not hold, this seems to be the only solution.Let me double-check the step where I set ( y = 1 ) and ( y = -1 ). I used the fact that ( f ) is odd, which I had established earlier. So, that step seems valid.Also, when I set ( x = y ), I found ( f(0) = 0 ), which is consistent with ( f(x) = kx ) since ( f(0) = 0 ).Another thing I can check is whether the function is additive or multiplicative. Since ( f(x^2) = x f(x) ), and if ( f(x) = kx ), then ( f(x^2) = kx^2 ), which is equal to ( x f(x) = x(kx) = kx^2 ). So, that's consistent.Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude that the only solutions are linear functions of the form ( f(x) = kx ).**Final Answer**The function ( f ) satisfying the given equation is boxed{f(x) = kx} for some constant ( k )."},{"question":"Jo adds up all the positive integers from 1 to 50. Kate does a similar thing with the first 50 positive integers; however, she first rounds every integer to its nearest multiple of 5 (rounding 2.5s up) and then adds the 50 values. What is the positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the sum of the first 50 positive integers for Jo. This can be done using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: ( S = frac{n}{2} times (a + l) ), where ( n = 50 ), ( a = 1 ), and ( l = 50 ). Plugging in these values, the sum is ( 1275 ).Next, for Kate, she rounds each integer to the nearest multiple of 5 before summing them. By examining a set of five consecutive numbers, I observe that the rounding adjustments cancel each other out, resulting in no change to the sum for each set of five numbers. Since there are 10 such sets in the first 50 numbers, the total sum remains ( 1275 ).Finally, the positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum is calculated as ( |1275 - 1275| = 0 )."},{"question":"Among -3.5, frac{22}{7}, 0.161161116ldots, 0, and frac{pi}{2}, the number of rational numbers is ( ).A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4","answer":"First, I need to identify which numbers among the given options are rational.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers, especially in equations like this, it's often helpful to solve for ( z ) directly. The equation given is ( frac{2i}{z} = 1 - i ). So, my goal is to find ( z ).I think the first step is to isolate ( z ). To do that, I can rewrite the equation as ( z = frac{2i}{1 - i} ). That makes sense because if ( frac{2i}{z} = 1 - i ), then ( z ) must be ( 2i ) divided by ( 1 - i ).Now, I have ( z = frac{2i}{1 - i} ). But I remember that when you have a complex number in the denominator, it's usually a good idea to rationalize the denominator. That means I need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. The complex conjugate of ( 1 - i ) is ( 1 + i ), right?So, let me do that. Multiply numerator and denominator by ( 1 + i ):( z = frac{2i times (1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)} ).Okay, let's compute the denominator first because that's straightforward. When you multiply ( (1 - i)(1 + i) ), it's a difference of squares, so it becomes ( 1^2 - (i)^2 ). Since ( i^2 = -1 ), this simplifies to ( 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2 ). So, the denominator is 2.Now, the numerator: ( 2i times (1 + i) ). Let me distribute the ( 2i ):( 2i times 1 = 2i ) and ( 2i times i = 2i^2 ).So, the numerator becomes ( 2i + 2i^2 ). But ( i^2 = -1 ), so ( 2i^2 = 2 times (-1) = -2 ). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to ( 2i - 2 ).Putting it all together, ( z = frac{2i - 2}{2} ). I can factor out a 2 in the numerator:( z = frac{2(i - 1)}{2} ).The 2's cancel out, so ( z = i - 1 ). Alternatively, that can be written as ( -1 + i ).Looking back at the options, option B is ( -1 + i ), which matches my result. So, I think the answer is B.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from ( frac{2i}{z} = 1 - i ), solving for ( z ) gives ( z = frac{2i}{1 - i} ). Then, multiplying numerator and denominator by ( 1 + i ):Numerator: ( 2i(1 + i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i - 2 ).Denominator: ( (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2 ).So, ( z = frac{2i - 2}{2} = i - 1 = -1 + i ). Yep, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can plug the answer back into the original equation to verify. If ( z = -1 + i ), then ( frac{2i}{z} ) should equal ( 1 - i ).Let's compute ( frac{2i}{-1 + i} ). Again, to simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is ( -1 - i ):( frac{2i times (-1 - i)}{(-1 + i)(-1 - i)} ).Compute denominator first: ( (-1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2 ).Numerator: ( 2i times (-1 - i) = -2i - 2i^2 = -2i - 2(-1) = -2i + 2 ).So, ( frac{-2i + 2}{2} = frac{2 - 2i}{2} = 1 - i ). Which is exactly the right-hand side of the original equation. So, that checks out.Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option B: ( -1 + i ).**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"John buys 20 candy bars. His brother Dave pays for 6 of them.

I need to find the value of sin(A + œÄ/4). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that in any triangle, the Law of Sines holds. That is, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. Maybe I can use this to rewrite the given equation in terms of the sides a, b, c instead of the sines of the angles. Let me try that.So, if I let a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, and c = 2R sin C, then sin A = a/(2R), sin B = b/(2R), and sin C = c/(2R). Let me substitute these into the equation.Starting with the left side: 3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤C becomes 3*(b¬≤/(4R¬≤)) + 7*(c¬≤/(4R¬≤)) = (3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)/(4R¬≤).On the right side: 2 sin A sin B sin C + 2 sin¬≤A becomes 2*(a/(2R))*(b/(2R))*(c/(2R)) + 2*(a¬≤/(4R¬≤)) = 2*(abc)/(8R¬≥) + 2*(a¬≤)/(4R¬≤) = (abc)/(4R¬≥) + (a¬≤)/(2R¬≤).So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:(3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)/(4R¬≤) = (abc)/(4R¬≥) + (a¬≤)/(2R¬≤)Hmm, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 4R¬≥ to eliminate the denominators. Let's see:Left side: (3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)/(4R¬≤) * 4R¬≥ = (3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)*RRight side: [(abc)/(4R¬≥) + (a¬≤)/(2R¬≤)] * 4R¬≥ = abc + 2a¬≤RSo now the equation is:(3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)*R = abc + 2a¬≤RHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can rearrange terms:(3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)*R - 2a¬≤R = abcFactor out R on the left:R*(3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤ - 2a¬≤) = abcHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe instead of using the Law of Sines, I should try using the Law of Cosines somewhere. Because the equation involves sin¬≤ terms, which relate to cosines through the identity sin¬≤Œ∏ = 1 - cos¬≤Œ∏. But that might complicate things further.Wait, another thought: maybe instead of substituting the sines with the sides, I can express everything in terms of angles. Since in a triangle, A + B + C = œÄ, so maybe I can express one angle in terms of the others.But I'm not sure. Let me think again about the given equation:3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤C = 2 sin A sin B sin C + 2 sin¬≤AI wonder if I can rearrange this equation to group similar terms. Let's try moving all terms to one side:3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤C - 2 sin A sin B sin C - 2 sin¬≤A = 0Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor some terms. Let me see:Looking at 3 sin¬≤B - 2 sin A sin B sin C, maybe factor sin B:sin B (3 sin B - 2 sin A sin C) + 7 sin¬≤C - 2 sin¬≤A = 0Still not helpful. Maybe I can consider expressing sin A in terms of sin B and sin C, but that might not be straightforward.Wait, another approach: perhaps assume that the triangle is right-angled or something, but I don't have information about that.Alternatively, maybe consider specific values for angles to see if the equation holds. For example, suppose A is 45 degrees, then sin(A + œÄ/4) would be sin(90 degrees) = 1, but I don't know if that's the case.Wait, maybe I can use substitution. Let me denote x = sin A, y = sin B, z = sin C. Then, since A + B + C = œÄ, we have some relationship between x, y, z.But that might not be straightforward either. Alternatively, maybe express sin C in terms of sin(A + B), since C = œÄ - A - B.So, sin C = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B.Hmm, that could be useful. Let me substitute that into the equation.Given that, let's rewrite the equation:3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤C = 2 sin A sin B sin C + 2 sin¬≤ASubstituting sin C = sin(A + B):3 sin¬≤B + 7 [sin(A + B)]¬≤ = 2 sin A sin B [sin(A + B)] + 2 sin¬≤ALet me compute [sin(A + B)]¬≤:[sin(A + B)]¬≤ = sin¬≤A cos¬≤B + 2 sin A cos A sin B cos B + cos¬≤A sin¬≤BSo, 3 sin¬≤B + 7 [sin¬≤A cos¬≤B + 2 sin A cos A sin B cos B + cos¬≤A sin¬≤B] = 2 sin A sin B [sin(A + B)] + 2 sin¬≤AThis is getting complicated, but let's try expanding the left side:3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤A cos¬≤B + 14 sin A cos A sin B cos B + 7 cos¬≤A sin¬≤BAnd the right side:2 sin A sin B [sin A cos B + cos A sin B] + 2 sin¬≤AWhich is:2 sin¬≤A sin B cos B + 2 sin A cos A sin¬≤B + 2 sin¬≤ASo, now, let's write the entire equation:Left side: 3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤A cos¬≤B + 14 sin A cos A sin B cos B + 7 cos¬≤A sin¬≤BRight side: 2 sin¬≤A sin B cos B + 2 sin A cos A sin¬≤B + 2 sin¬≤ANow, let's bring all terms to the left side:3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤A cos¬≤B + 14 sin A cos A sin B cos B + 7 cos¬≤A sin¬≤B - 2 sin¬≤A sin B cos B - 2 sin A cos A sin¬≤B - 2 sin¬≤A = 0This is quite messy, but let's try to collect like terms.First, let's collect terms with sin¬≤A cos¬≤B:7 sin¬≤A cos¬≤BTerms with sin¬≤A:-2 sin¬≤ATerms with sin¬≤B:3 sin¬≤B + 7 cos¬≤A sin¬≤BTerms with sin A cos A sin B cos B:14 sin A cos A sin B cos B - 2 sin¬≤A sin B cos B - 2 sin A cos A sin¬≤BHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.Wait, going back to the original equation:3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤C = 2 sin A sin B sin C + 2 sin¬≤AMaybe I can use the Law of Sines here. Let me denote a, b, c as the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively. Then, by the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.So, sin A = a/(2R), sin B = b/(2R), sin C = c/(2R). Let me substitute these into the equation.Left side: 3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤C = 3*(b¬≤/(4R¬≤)) + 7*(c¬≤/(4R¬≤)) = (3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)/(4R¬≤)Right side: 2 sin A sin B sin C + 2 sin¬≤A = 2*(a/(2R))*(b/(2R))*(c/(2R)) + 2*(a¬≤/(4R¬≤)) = (abc)/(4R¬≥) + (a¬≤)/(2R¬≤)So, setting them equal:(3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)/(4R¬≤) = (abc)/(4R¬≥) + (a¬≤)/(2R¬≤)Multiply both sides by 4R¬≥ to eliminate denominators:(3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)*R = abc + 2a¬≤RHmm, so we have:(3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤)*R = abc + 2a¬≤RLet me rearrange this:(3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤ - 2a¬≤)*R = abcHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe divide both sides by R:3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤ - 2a¬≤ = (abc)/RBut I don't know what abc/R is. Maybe express abc in terms of R? Since a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C, so abc = 8R¬≥ sin A sin B sin C.So, abc/R = 8R¬≤ sin A sin B sin C.Therefore, the equation becomes:3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤ - 2a¬≤ = 8R¬≤ sin A sin B sin CBut from the original equation, we have 3 sin¬≤B + 7 sin¬≤C = 2 sin A sin B sin C + 2 sin¬≤A.Wait, maybe instead of going this route, I can use the Law of Cosines on a¬≤. Since a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos A.So, let me substitute a¬≤ from the Law of Cosines into the equation we had earlier:3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤ - 2a¬≤ = (abc)/RBut a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos A, so:3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤ - 2(b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos A) = (abc)/RSimplify:3b¬≤ + 7c¬≤ - 2b¬≤ - 2c¬≤ + 4bc cos A = (abc)/RWhich simplifies to:b¬≤ + 5c¬≤ + 4bc cos A = (abc)/RHmm, still complicated. Maybe express R in terms of a, b, c? Since R = a/(2 sin A) = b/(2 sin B) = c/(2 sin C).So, R = a/(2 sin A). Therefore, 1/R = 2 sin A / a.So, (abc)/R = abc * 2 sin A / a = 2bc sin A.Therefore, the equation becomes:b¬≤ + 5c¬≤ + 4bc cos A = 2bc sin ASo, bringing all terms to one side:b¬≤ + 5c¬≤ + 4bc cos A - 2bc sin A = 0Hmm, interesting. Let me factor out bc:b¬≤ + 5c¬≤ + bc(4 cos A - 2 sin A) = 0This is a quadratic in terms of b and c. Maybe I can consider this as a quadratic equation in b/c or c/b.Let me divide both sides by c¬≤ to make it in terms of (b/c):(b/c)¬≤ + 5 + (b/c)(4 cos A - 2 sin A) = 0Let me denote k = b/c. Then the equation becomes:k¬≤ + 5 + k(4 cos A - 2 sin A) = 0This is a quadratic in k:k¬≤ + (4 cos A - 2 sin A)k + 5 = 0For real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative.Discriminant D = [4 cos A - 2 sin A]^2 - 4*1*5Compute D:= 16 cos¬≤A - 16 cos A sin A + 4 sin¬≤A - 20= (16 cos¬≤A + 4 sin¬≤A) - 16 cos A sin A - 20Hmm, maybe express this in terms of sin and cos.Alternatively, factor:= 4(4 cos¬≤A + sin¬≤A) - 16 cos A sin A - 20Not sure. Alternatively, let's compute:16 cos¬≤A - 16 cos A sin A + 4 sin¬≤A - 20= 16 cos¬≤A + 4 sin¬≤A - 16 cos A sin A - 20Hmm, maybe factor 4:= 4(4 cos¬≤A + sin¬≤A - 4 cos A sin A) - 20Not sure.

Recall that:cos¬≤A = (1 + cos 2A)/2sin¬≤A = (1 - cos 2A)/2sin A cos A = (sin 2A)/2So, substituting:16*(1 + cos 2A)/2 + 4*(1 - cos 2A)/2 - 16*(sin 2A)/2 - 20 ‚â• 0Simplify:8(1 + cos 2A) + 2(1 - cos 2A) - 8 sin 2A - 20 ‚â• 0= 8 + 8 cos 2A + 2 - 2 cos 2A - 8 sin 2A - 20 ‚â• 0Combine like terms:(8 + 2 - 20) + (8 cos 2A - 2 cos 2A) - 8 sin 2A ‚â• 0= (-10) + 6 cos 2A - 8 sin 2A ‚â• 0So,6 cos 2A - 8 sin 2A ‚â• 10Hmm, this is interesting. Let me write this as:6 cos 2A - 8 sin 2A ‚â• 10I can write the left side as R cos(2A + œÜ), where R is the amplitude and œÜ is the phase shift.Compute R:R = sqrt(6¬≤ + (-8)^2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10So,6 cos 2A - 8 sin 2A = 10 cos(2A + œÜ)Where œÜ = arctan(8/6) = arctan(4/3). Because tan œÜ = |B/A| = 8/6 = 4/3.So, œÜ = arctan(4/3). Therefore,10 cos(2A + œÜ) ‚â• 10Divide both sides by 10:cos(2A + œÜ) ‚â• 1But the maximum value of cosine is 1, so this inequality holds only when cos(2A + œÜ) = 1.Therefore,2A + œÜ = 2œÄk, where k is an integer.So,2A = -œÜ + 2œÄkA = (-œÜ/2) + œÄkBut since A is an angle in a triangle, it must be between 0 and œÄ. So, let's take k=0:A = -œÜ/2But that would give a negative angle, which isn't possible. So, take k=1:A = (-œÜ/2) + œÄSo,A = œÄ - œÜ/2Since œÜ = arctan(4/3), let's compute œÜ/2.First, tan œÜ = 4/3, so œÜ = arctan(4/3). Let me find sin œÜ and cos œÜ.If tan œÜ = 4/3, then we can imagine a right triangle with opposite side 4, adjacent side 3, hypotenuse 5.So,sin œÜ = 4/5cos œÜ = 3/5Now, we can compute sin(œÜ/2) and cos(œÜ/2) using half-angle identities.sin(œÜ/2) = sqrt[(1 - cos œÜ)/2] = sqrt[(1 - 3/5)/2] = sqrt[(2/5)/2] = sqrt(1/5) = 1/‚àö5cos(œÜ/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos œÜ)/2] = sqrt[(1 + 3/5)/2] = sqrt[(8/5)/2] = sqrt(4/5) = 2/‚àö5Therefore,A = œÄ - œÜ/2So,sin(A + œÄ/4) = sin(œÄ - œÜ/2 + œÄ/4) = sin(5œÄ/4 - œÜ/2)Using the sine of a difference:sin(5œÄ/4 - œÜ/2) = sin(5œÄ/4)cos(œÜ/2) - cos(5œÄ/4)sin(œÜ/2)We know that:sin(5œÄ/4) = -‚àö2/2cos(5œÄ/4) = -‚àö2/2So,= (-‚àö2/2)(2/‚àö5) - (-‚àö2/2)(1/‚àö5)= (-‚àö2/2)(2/‚àö5) + (‚àö2/2)(1/‚àö5)= (-‚àö2 * 2)/(2‚àö5) + (‚àö2)/(2‚àö5)= (-‚àö2)/‚àö5 + ‚àö2/(2‚àö5)Wait, let me compute step by step:First term: (-‚àö2/2)(2/‚àö5) = (-‚àö2 * 2)/(2‚àö5) = (-‚àö2)/‚àö5Second term: (-‚àö2/2)(1/‚àö5) = (-‚àö2)/(2‚àö5). But there's a negative sign in front, so it becomes +‚àö2/(2‚àö5)So, total:(-‚àö2)/‚àö5 + ‚àö2/(2‚àö5) = (-2‚àö2 + ‚àö2)/(2‚àö5) = (-‚àö2)/(2‚àö5)Simplify:= (-‚àö2)/(2‚àö5) = (-‚àö10)/10So, sin(A + œÄ/4) = -‚àö10/10Therefore, the value is -‚àö10/10."},{"question":"If the range of the function y=f(x) is [1,3], then the range of the function F(x)=1-2f(x+3) is ( )A: [-5,-1]B: [-2,0]C: [-6,-2]D: [1,3]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about functions and their ranges. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The function given is y = f(x), and its range is [1, 3]. That means the smallest value f(x) can take is 1, and the largest is 3. So, for any x, f(x) is between 1 and 3, inclusive.Now, the question is about another function, F(x) = 1 - 2f(x + 3). I need to find the range of F(x). Hmm, okay. So, F(x) is defined in terms of f(x + 3). I remember that when you have a function like f(x + c), it's a horizontal shift of the original function f(x). But in this case, since we're dealing with the range, which is about the y-values, the horizontal shift shouldn't affect the range, right? So, the range of f(x + 3) should still be [1, 3], just like f(x). That makes sense because shifting the graph left or right doesn't change the y-values, only their positions along the x-axis.So, if f(x + 3) has the same range as f(x), which is [1, 3], then I can work with that. Now, let's look at F(x) = 1 - 2f(x + 3). I need to figure out how the transformations affect the range. Let me break it down.First, let's consider the term -2f(x + 3). Since f(x + 3) is between 1 and 3, multiplying it by -2 will flip the values and scale them. Let me compute the minimum and maximum of this term.If f(x + 3) is at its minimum, which is 1, then -2 * 1 = -2. If f(x + 3) is at its maximum, which is 3, then -2 * 3 = -6. So, the term -2f(x + 3) ranges from -6 to -2. That is, -6 ‚â§ -2f(x + 3) ‚â§ -2.Now, the function F(x) is 1 plus that term. So, I need to add 1 to each part of the inequality. Let's do that.Starting with the lower bound: -6 + 1 = -5. Then the upper bound: -2 + 1 = -1. So, putting it together, F(x) ranges from -5 to -1. Therefore, the range of F(x) is [-5, -1].Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I considered that f(x + 3) has the same range as f(x), which is correct because horizontal shifts don't affect the range. Then, I multiplied the range [1, 3] by -2, which flips the order and scales the values, resulting in [-6, -2]. Finally, I added 1 to each bound, giving me [-5, -1]. That seems right.Looking at the answer choices, option A is [-5, -1], which matches my result. So, I think that's the correct answer.Wait, just to make sure, let me think about the transformations again. The function F(x) is a vertical reflection (because of the negative sign) and a vertical stretch (because of the 2), followed by a vertical shift (because of the +1). So, reflecting over the x-axis would flip the range, stretching it by a factor of 2 would make the range wider, and then shifting it up by 1 would adjust the entire range accordingly. Yeah, that all lines up with what I did earlier.I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just verify the arithmetic:-2 * 1 = -2-2 * 3 = -6Then adding 1:-6 + 1 = -5-2 + 1 = -1Yep, that's correct. So, the range is definitely [-5, -1], which is option A.I guess another way to think about it is to consider specific values. If f(x + 3) is 1, then F(x) = 1 - 2*1 = -1. If f(x + 3) is 3, then F(x) = 1 - 2*3 = 1 - 6 = -5. So, the maximum value of F(x) is -1, and the minimum is -5. That confirms it again.Alright, I feel confident that option A is the right answer.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Express as a common fraction in simplest form:sqrt{8frac{9}{16}}","answer":"First, I need to convert the mixed number (8frac{9}{16}) into an improper fraction. To do this, I'll multiply the whole number 8 by the denominator 16, which gives me 128. Then, I'll add the numerator 9 to this result, resulting in 137. So, the improper fraction is (frac{137}{16}).Next, I'll take the square root of this improper fraction. The square root of a fraction can be expressed as the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator. Therefore, (sqrt{frac{137}{16}}) becomes (frac{sqrt{137}}{sqrt{16}}).Since (sqrt{16}) is 4, the expression simplifies to (frac{sqrt{137}}{4}).Finally, I'll check if (sqrt{137}) can be simplified further. Since 137 is a prime number, its square root cannot be broken down any further. Thus, the simplest form of the expression is (frac{sqrt{137}}{4})."},{"question":"We bought 85 hats at the store.

Arrange these numbers in ascending order.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to arrange three numbers (a), (b), and (c) in ascending order. These numbers are all between 0 and (pi/2), and they satisfy the following equations:1. (cos a = a)2. (sin(cos b) = b)3. (cos(sin c) = c)Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's consider each equation individually to understand what (a), (b), and (c) represent.Starting with the first equation: (cos a = a). I remember that the cosine function is decreasing on the interval ((0, pi/2)). At (a = 0), (cos 0 = 1), which is greater than 0. As (a) increases towards (pi/2), (cos a) decreases towards 0. So, the equation (cos a = a) is asking for the point where the cosine function intersects the line (y = a). I think this is a well-known equation, and the solution is called the Dottie number, which is approximately 0.739085. So, (a) is around 0.739.Next, the second equation: (sin(cos b) = b). This one is a bit more complex. Let's see. Since (b) is between 0 and (pi/2), (cos b) will be between 0 and 1. Then, (sin(cos b)) will also be between 0 and (sin 1), which is approximately 0.8415. So, (b) must be less than 0.8415. But how much less? Let me think. If I plug in (b = 0), (sin(cos 0) = sin(1) approx 0.8415), which is greater than 0. If I plug in (b = 0.8415), (sin(cos 0.8415)). Let's calculate (cos 0.8415). Since (cos 0.8415) is approximately (cos(0.8415)), which is roughly 0.666. Then, (sin(0.666)) is approximately 0.618. So, (sin(cos 0.8415) approx 0.618), which is less than 0.8415. So, the function (sin(cos b)) starts above (b) at (b=0) and ends below (b) at (b=0.8415). Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a solution somewhere between 0 and 0.8415. I think this solution is less than (a), which is approximately 0.739, but I'm not entirely sure yet.Now, the third equation: (cos(sin c) = c). Similar to the second equation, but with cosine and sine swapped. Let's analyze this. Since (c) is between 0 and (pi/2), (sin c) will be between 0 and 1. Then, (cos(sin c)) will be between (cos 1) and (cos 0), which is between approximately 0.5403 and 1. So, (c) must be between 0.5403 and 1. But again, let's see how this behaves. If (c = 0), (cos(sin 0) = cos(0) = 1), which is greater than 0. If (c = 1), (cos(sin 1) approx cos(0.8415) approx 0.666), which is less than 1. So, similar to the second equation, the function (cos(sin c)) starts above (c) at (c=0) and ends below (c) at (c=1). Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a solution somewhere between 0 and 1. I suspect this solution is greater than (a), which is around 0.739, but again, I'm not entirely sure.So, to summarize:- (a) is approximately 0.739.- (b) is somewhere between 0 and 0.8415, likely less than (a).- (c) is somewhere between 0.5403 and 1, likely greater than (a).But I need to be more precise. Maybe I can approximate the values of (b) and (c) numerically.Let's start with (b). We have (sin(cos b) = b). Let's make a table of values to approximate (b).Let me choose some values for (b) and compute (sin(cos b)):- (b = 0.5): (cos 0.5 approx 0.8776), (sin(0.8776) approx 0.7692). So, (sin(cos 0.5) approx 0.7692), which is greater than 0.5.- (b = 0.7): (cos 0.7 approx 0.7648), (sin(0.7648) approx 0.6912). So, (sin(cos 0.7) approx 0.6912), which is less than 0.7.- (b = 0.65): (cos 0.65 approx 0.7961), (sin(0.7961) approx 0.7133). So, (sin(cos 0.65) approx 0.7133), which is greater than 0.65.- (b = 0.68): (cos 0.68 approx 0.7755), (sin(0.7755) approx 0.7000). So, (sin(cos 0.68) approx 0.7000), which is greater than 0.68.- (b = 0.69): (cos 0.69 approx 0.7715), (sin(0.7715) approx 0.6967). So, (sin(cos 0.69) approx 0.6967), which is greater than 0.69.- (b = 0.695): (cos 0.695 approx 0.7692), (sin(0.7692) approx 0.6947). So, (sin(cos 0.695) approx 0.6947), which is less than 0.695.So, between (b = 0.69) and (b = 0.695), (sin(cos b)) crosses (b). Let's try (b = 0.693):- (cos 0.693 approx 0.7692), (sin(0.7692) approx 0.6947). So, (sin(cos 0.693) approx 0.6947), which is slightly greater than 0.693.And (b = 0.694):- (cos 0.694 approx 0.7689), (sin(0.7689) approx 0.6943). So, (sin(cos 0.694) approx 0.6943), which is slightly less than 0.694.Therefore, the solution for (b) is approximately 0.694.Now, let's approximate (c) from the equation (cos(sin c) = c).Again, let's make a table of values:- (c = 0.5): (sin 0.5 approx 0.4794), (cos(0.4794) approx 0.8872), which is greater than 0.5.- (c = 0.7): (sin 0.7 approx 0.6442), (cos(0.6442) approx 0.8000), which is greater than 0.7.- (c = 0.8): (sin 0.8 approx 0.7174), (cos(0.7174) approx 0.7536), which is less than 0.8.- (c = 0.75): (sin 0.75 approx 0.6816), (cos(0.6816) approx 0.7767), which is greater than 0.75.- (c = 0.775): (sin 0.775 approx 0.7000), (cos(0.7000) approx 0.7648), which is less than 0.775.- (c = 0.76): (sin 0.76 approx 0.6889), (cos(0.6889) approx 0.7700), which is greater than 0.76.- (c = 0.765): (sin 0.765 approx 0.6920), (cos(0.6920) approx 0.7692), which is greater than 0.765.- (c = 0.767): (sin 0.767 approx 0.6940), (cos(0.6940) approx 0.7689), which is greater than 0.767.- (c = 0.768): (sin 0.768 approx 0.6947), (cos(0.6947) approx 0.7689), which is approximately equal to 0.768.So, the solution for (c) is approximately 0.768.Now, let's compare the approximate values:- (a approx 0.739)- (b approx 0.694)- (c approx 0.768)So, arranging them in ascending order: (b < a < c).Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For (b), I approximated it to be around 0.694, which is less than (a) at 0.739. For (c), I got approximately 0.768, which is greater than (a). So, the order should indeed be (b < a < c).Just to be thorough, let me check the values again:- For (b = 0.694), (cos b approx 0.7689), (sin(0.7689) approx 0.6943), which is very close to 0.694.- For (c = 0.768), (sin c approx 0.6947), (cos(0.6947) approx 0.7689), which is very close to 0.768.Yes, these seem consistent. Therefore, the order is (b < a < c)."},{"question":"One base of a trapezoid is 120 units longer than the other base. The segment that joins the midpoints of the legs divides the trapezoid into two regions whose areas are in the ratio 3: 4. Let x be the length of the segment joining the legs of the trapezoid that is parallel to the bases and that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. Find the greatest integer that does not exceed x^2/120.","answer":"Okay, so I have this trapezoid problem. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that one base of a trapezoid is 120 units longer than the other base. So, if I let the shorter base be ( b ), then the longer base must be ( b + 120 ). Got that.Next, it mentions a segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. I remember that in a trapezoid, the segment connecting the midpoints of the legs is called the midline or the median. The length of this midline is the average of the lengths of the two bases. So, that should be ( frac{b + (b + 120)}{2} ), which simplifies to ( b + 60 ). Okay, that makes sense.Now, this midline divides the trapezoid into two regions, and their areas are in the ratio 3:4. Hmm, so the area above the midline is 3 parts, and the area below is 4 parts. Since the entire trapezoid is divided into two parts by the midline, the total area is 3 + 4 = 7 parts. Let me denote the height of the entire trapezoid as ( h ). Then, the height of each smaller trapezoid formed by the midline would be ( frac{h}{2} ), right? Because the midline is halfway up the legs.So, the area of the upper trapezoid (with bases ( b ) and ( b + 60 )) would be ( frac{1}{2} times frac{h}{2} times (b + (b + 60)) ). Simplifying that, it's ( frac{1}{2} times frac{h}{2} times (2b + 60) ), which is ( frac{h}{4} times (2b + 60) ) or ( frac{h}{2} times (b + 30) ).Similarly, the area of the lower trapezoid (with bases ( b + 60 ) and ( b + 120 )) would be ( frac{1}{2} times frac{h}{2} times ((b + 60) + (b + 120)) ). That simplifies to ( frac{1}{2} times frac{h}{2} times (2b + 180) ), which is ( frac{h}{4} times (2b + 180) ) or ( frac{h}{2} times (b + 90) ).According to the problem, the ratio of these areas is 3:4. So, I can set up the equation:[frac{frac{h}{2} times (b + 30)}{frac{h}{2} times (b + 90)} = frac{3}{4}]The ( frac{h}{2} ) terms cancel out, so I get:[frac{b + 30}{b + 90} = frac{3}{4}]Cross-multiplying gives:[4(b + 30) = 3(b + 90)]Expanding both sides:[4b + 120 = 3b + 270]Subtracting ( 3b ) from both sides:[b + 120 = 270]Subtracting 120 from both sides:[b = 150]So, the shorter base is 150 units, and the longer base is ( 150 + 120 = 270 ) units. Got that.Now, the problem introduces another segment ( x ) that joins the legs of the trapezoid, is parallel to the bases, and divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. I need to find ( x ) and then compute the greatest integer that does not exceed ( frac{x^2}{120} ).First, let's recall that the area of a trapezoid is ( frac{1}{2} times ( text{sum of the bases} ) times text{height} ). The total area of the trapezoid is ( frac{1}{2} times (150 + 270) times h = frac{1}{2} times 420 times h = 210h ).Since we need to divide this area into two equal parts, each part must be ( 105h ).Let me denote the height from the shorter base to the segment ( x ) as ( h_1 ). Then, the area above ( x ) is ( frac{1}{2} times (150 + x) times h_1 = 105h ).So, the equation becomes:[frac{1}{2} times (150 + x) times h_1 = 105h]Multiplying both sides by 2:[(150 + x) times h_1 = 210h]So,[h_1 = frac{210h}{150 + x}]Now, since ( x ) is parallel to the bases, the two trapezoids formed are similar. The ratio of their corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of their heights. So, the ratio of ( x ) to the longer base is the same as the ratio of ( h_1 ) to the total height ( h ).Wait, actually, it's a bit more precise. The segment ( x ) is somewhere between the two bases, so the ratio of the lengths of the bases is equal to the ratio of the distances from the top. Let me think.If I consider the trapezoid above ( x ) and the entire trapezoid, they are similar. So, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of their heights. So, the ratio ( frac{x - 150}{270 - 150} = frac{h_1}{h} ).Wait, that might not be exactly correct. Let me think again.Actually, when you have a line parallel to the bases in a trapezoid, the length of that line can be found using the formula:[x = b + left( frac{h_1}{h} right) times (B - b)]Where ( b ) is the shorter base, ( B ) is the longer base, and ( h_1 ) is the height from the shorter base to the segment ( x ).So, plugging in the values:[x = 150 + left( frac{h_1}{h} right) times (270 - 150) = 150 + left( frac{h_1}{h} right) times 120]So,[x = 150 + frac{120 h_1}{h}]But from earlier, we have ( h_1 = frac{210h}{150 + x} ). So, substituting that into the equation:[x = 150 + frac{120 times frac{210h}{150 + x}}{h}]Simplify the ( h ):[x = 150 + frac{120 times 210}{150 + x}]Calculate ( 120 times 210 ):[120 times 210 = 25200]So,[x = 150 + frac{25200}{150 + x}]Let me write this as:[x - 150 = frac{25200}{150 + x}]Multiply both sides by ( 150 + x ):[(x - 150)(150 + x) = 25200]This simplifies to:[x^2 - 150^2 = 25200]Wait, no. Let me expand the left side:[(x - 150)(x + 150) = x^2 - (150)^2 = x^2 - 22500]So,[x^2 - 22500 = 25200]Adding 22500 to both sides:[x^2 = 25200 + 22500 = 47700]Wait, that can't be right because earlier, the assistant got ( x = 180 ), which squared is 32400. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.Let me go back. The formula for the length of a line segment parallel to the bases in a trapezoid is:[x = b + left( frac{h_1}{h} right)(B - b)]But in this case, since we're dealing with areas, maybe I need to use the property that the ratio of the areas is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding sides. Wait, no, that's for similar figures, but in this case, the trapezoids are similar only if the segment is the midline, which it's not necessarily.Wait, actually, the area ratio when you have a line parallel to the bases is not just the square of the height ratio, because the area of a trapezoid depends on both the height and the average of the bases.So, perhaps a better approach is to set up the area equation.We have the area above ( x ) as ( 105h ), which is half of the total area ( 210h ). The area above ( x ) is a trapezoid with bases ( 150 ) and ( x ), and height ( h_1 ). So,[frac{1}{2} (150 + x) h_1 = 105h]Which simplifies to:[(150 + x) h_1 = 210h]So,[h_1 = frac{210h}{150 + x}]Now, the height from ( x ) to the longer base is ( h - h_1 ). So, the area below ( x ) is a trapezoid with bases ( x ) and ( 270 ), and height ( h - h_1 ). Its area is also ( 105h ), so:[frac{1}{2} (x + 270)(h - h_1) = 105h]Which simplifies to:[(x + 270)(h - h_1) = 210h]Substituting ( h_1 = frac{210h}{150 + x} ):[(x + 270)left(h - frac{210h}{150 + x}right) = 210h]Factor out ( h ):[(x + 270)h left(1 - frac{210}{150 + x}right) = 210h]Divide both sides by ( h ):[(x + 270)left(1 - frac{210}{150 + x}right) = 210]Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:[1 - frac{210}{150 + x} = frac{(150 + x) - 210}{150 + x} = frac{x - 60}{150 + x}]So, the equation becomes:[(x + 270) times frac{x - 60}{150 + x} = 210]Multiply both sides by ( 150 + x ):[(x + 270)(x - 60) = 210(150 + x)]Expand the left side:[x^2 - 60x + 270x - 16200 = x^2 + 210x - 16200]Right side:[210 times 150 + 210x = 31500 + 210x]So, the equation is:[x^2 + 210x - 16200 = 31500 + 210x]Subtract ( 210x ) from both sides:[x^2 - 16200 = 31500]Add 16200 to both sides:[x^2 = 31500 + 16200 = 47700]Wait, that's the same result as before, which contradicts the assistant's solution where ( x = 180 ). Hmm, something's wrong here because 180 squared is 32400, not 47700.Let me check my steps again.Starting from:[(x + 270)(x - 60) = 210(150 + x)]Expanding the left side:[x^2 - 60x + 270x - 16200 = x^2 + 210x - 16200]Right side:[210 times 150 + 210x = 31500 + 210x]So, equation:[x^2 + 210x - 16200 = 31500 + 210x]Subtract ( 210x ):[x^2 - 16200 = 31500]Add 16200:[x^2 = 47700]So, ( x = sqrt{47700} approx 218.4 ). But the assistant got ( x = 180 ). So, where is the mistake?Wait, maybe the initial setup is wrong. Let me think differently.Another approach: The area of a trapezoid is ( frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h ). When you draw a line parallel to the bases, dividing the trapezoid into two regions of equal area, the length of that line can be found using the formula:[x = sqrt{frac{b_1^2 + b_2^2}{2}}]Wait, no, that's the formula for the root mean square, which isn't directly applicable here.Alternatively, I remember that the length of the line segment that divides the trapezoid into two equal areas is the root mean square of the two bases. So,[x = sqrt{frac{b_1^2 + b_2^2}{2}}]But let me verify this.Suppose the two bases are ( b_1 ) and ( b_2 ), and the height is ( h ). Let the segment ( x ) be at a height ( k ) from the base ( b_1 ). The area above ( x ) is ( frac{1}{2} (b_1 + x) k ), and the area below ( x ) is ( frac{1}{2} (x + b_2)(h - k) ). Since these areas are equal:[frac{1}{2} (b_1 + x) k = frac{1}{2} (x + b_2)(h - k)]Simplify:[(b_1 + x) k = (x + b_2)(h - k)]Also, since the trapezoids are similar, the ratio ( frac{k}{h} = frac{x - b_1}{b_2 - b_1} ). Let me denote ( r = frac{k}{h} ), so ( x = b_1 + r(b_2 - b_1) ).Substituting ( x ) into the area equation:[(b_1 + b_1 + r(b_2 - b_1)) times r h = (b_1 + r(b_2 - b_1) + b_2)(h - r h)]Simplify:Left side:[(2b_1 + r(b_2 - b_1)) times r h]Right side:[(b_1 + b_2 + r(b_2 - b_1)) times (1 - r) h]Divide both sides by ( h ):[(2b_1 + r(b_2 - b_1)) r = (b_1 + b_2 + r(b_2 - b_1))(1 - r)]Let me plug in ( b_1 = 150 ) and ( b_2 = 270 ):Left side:[(2 times 150 + r(270 - 150)) r = (300 + 120r) r = 300r + 120r^2]Right side:[(150 + 270 + r(270 - 150))(1 - r) = (420 + 120r)(1 - r) = 420(1 - r) + 120r(1 - r) = 420 - 420r + 120r - 120r^2 = 420 - 300r - 120r^2]So, the equation becomes:[300r + 120r^2 = 420 - 300r - 120r^2]Bring all terms to the left:[300r + 120r^2 - 420 + 300r + 120r^2 = 0]Combine like terms:[240r^2 + 600r - 420 = 0]Divide all terms by 60:[4r^2 + 10r - 7 = 0]Now, solve for ( r ):Using quadratic formula:[r = frac{-10 pm sqrt{100 + 112}}{8} = frac{-10 pm sqrt{212}}{8} = frac{-10 pm 2sqrt{53}}{8} = frac{-5 pm sqrt{53}}{4}]Since ( r ) must be positive and less than 1, we take the positive root:[r = frac{-5 + sqrt{53}}{4}]Calculate ( sqrt{53} approx 7.28 ), so:[r approx frac{-5 + 7.28}{4} = frac{2.28}{4} approx 0.57]So, ( r approx 0.57 ). Therefore, the height ( k = r h approx 0.57h ).Now, the length ( x ) is:[x = b_1 + r(b_2 - b_1) = 150 + 0.57(270 - 150) = 150 + 0.57 times 120 = 150 + 68.4 = 218.4]So, ( x approx 218.4 ). Then, ( x^2 approx 218.4^2 approx 47700 ). Dividing by 120:[frac{47700}{120} = 397.5]So, the greatest integer not exceeding 397.5 is 397. But wait, this contradicts the assistant's solution of 270. What's going on here?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation earlier. Let me go back to the equation:After expanding and simplifying, I had:[x^2 + 210x - 16200 = 31500 + 210x]Subtracting ( 210x ):[x^2 - 16200 = 31500]So,[x^2 = 47700]Which is correct. So, ( x = sqrt{47700} approx 218.4 ). Then, ( x^2 / 120 = 47700 / 120 = 397.5 ). So, the greatest integer not exceeding that is 397.But the assistant got 270. So, where is the mistake?Wait, perhaps the assistant made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the assistant's solution.The assistant set up:[frac{x - 150}{120} = frac{h_1}{h}]Which is correct because the difference in the bases is 120, and the segment ( x ) is ( 150 + ) something.Then, the assistant wrote:[frac{x - 150}{120} = frac{210}{150 + x}]Wait, that seems incorrect. Because ( h_1 = frac{210h}{150 + x} ), so ( frac{h_1}{h} = frac{210}{150 + x} ). So, the equation is:[frac{x - 150}{120} = frac{210}{150 + x}]Which leads to:[(x - 150)(150 + x) = 25200]Which is:[x^2 - 22500 = 25200]So,[x^2 = 47700]Which is the same result as mine. So, the assistant must have made a mistake in their solution because they ended up with ( x = 180 ), which squared is 32400, not 47700.Wait, looking back, the assistant wrote:[(x - 150)(150 + x) = 25200]Which expands to:[x^2 - 150^2 = 25200]So,[x^2 - 22500 = 25200]Thus,[x^2 = 47700]But then the assistant wrote:[x^2 - 75x - 18000 = 0]Wait, that's a different equation. How did they get that?Wait, maybe they made a mistake in expanding. Let me see:They wrote:[(x - 150)(150 + x) = 25200]Which is ( x^2 - 150^2 = x^2 - 22500 = 25200 ), leading to ( x^2 = 47700 ).But the assistant somehow got a quadratic equation:[x^2 - 75x - 18000 = 0]Which suggests that they might have miscalculated the cross terms. Let me see.Wait, perhaps they thought that ( (x - 150)(x + 150) = x^2 - 75x - 18000 ), but that's not correct. Actually, ( (x - 150)(x + 150) = x^2 - 22500 ), so the assistant must have made a mistake in their expansion.Therefore, the correct value of ( x ) is ( sqrt{47700} approx 218.4 ), and ( x^2 / 120 = 47700 / 120 = 397.5 ), so the greatest integer not exceeding that is 397.But wait, the problem says \\"the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs divides the trapezoid into two regions whose areas are in the ratio 3:4\\". The assistant used this to find ( b = 150 ), which is correct. Then, for the equal area segment, they set up the equation incorrectly, leading to an incorrect quadratic.So, the correct answer should be 397, not 270. But let me double-check.Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake in the area setup. Let me try another approach.The area of the trapezoid is ( frac{1}{2} (150 + 270) h = 210h ). We need to find ( x ) such that the area above ( x ) is ( 105h ).The area above ( x ) is ( frac{1}{2} (150 + x) h_1 = 105h ), so ( (150 + x) h_1 = 210h ).Also, since the trapezoids are similar, the ratio of the heights is equal to the ratio of the differences in the bases. So,[frac{h_1}{h} = frac{x - 150}{270 - 150} = frac{x - 150}{120}]So,[h_1 = frac{x - 150}{120} h]Substituting into the area equation:[(150 + x) times frac{x - 150}{120} h = 210h]Cancel ( h ):[(150 + x) times frac{x - 150}{120} = 210]Multiply both sides by 120:[(150 + x)(x - 150) = 25200]Which is:[x^2 - 150^2 = 25200]So,[x^2 = 25200 + 22500 = 47700]Thus, ( x = sqrt{47700} approx 218.4 ). Therefore, ( x^2 / 120 = 47700 / 120 = 397.5 ), so the greatest integer not exceeding this is 397.But the assistant got 270, which suggests they might have made a mistake in their quadratic equation setup. Therefore, the correct answer should be 397."},{"question":"The average (arithmetic mean) of 20, 40, and 60 is 8 more than the average of a certain number, 70, and 16.

Before the election for King of the Forest, some of the animals make an election campaign.

It is also known that no path between two caves is used by more than one campaign-making animal.a) Prove that for any prime ( n ), the maximum possible number of campaign-making animals is ( frac{n-1}{2} );b) Find the maximum number of campaign-making animals for ( n=9 ).","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem about campaign-making animals in a forest. It's divided into two parts, and I need to tackle both. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.First, we have n animals, each living in their own cave. The caves are connected in such a way that there's exactly one path between any two caves. This setup makes me think of a tree structure because, in a tree, there's exactly one path between any two nodes. However, the problem mentions that each campaign-making animal visits every other cave exactly once and returns to its own cave. That sounds like a cycle, specifically a Hamiltonian cycle, which is a cycle that visits every node exactly once and returns to the starting node.But wait, a tree doesn't contain any cycles, so how can there be Hamiltonian cycles? Maybe I misinterpreted the setup. Let me read it again. It says there's exactly one separate path between any two caves, which is the definition of a tree. But then, the campaign-making animals are moving along paths, visiting each cave exactly once, and returning home. That still sounds like a cycle, but in a tree, cycles aren't possible. Hmm, this is confusing.Oh, maybe the forest isn't just a single tree but a collection of trees. But no, the problem says \\"each of n animals lives in its own cave,\\" implying a single tree with n nodes. So, how can there be cycles? Maybe the forest is actually a complete graph, where every pair of caves is connected by a path, but the paths are unique. Wait, in a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two nodes, but the problem says exactly one path. That's the definition of a tree. So, it must be a tree.But then, how can an animal make a campaign by visiting every other cave exactly once and returning home? That would require a cycle, which isn't present in a tree. This is a contradiction. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps the forest is not just a tree but has multiple trees, and the campaign-making animals can traverse through multiple trees? But the problem says \\"each of n animals lives in its own cave,\\" which suggests a single tree. I'm stuck here.Let me think differently. Maybe the forest is a complete graph, and the paths are the edges. So, the forest is actually a complete graph where each pair of caves is connected by a unique path, which in a complete graph is just the direct edge between them. So, in this case, the forest is a complete graph, and the campaign-making animals are traversing Hamiltonian cycles in this complete graph.That makes more sense. So, the forest is a complete graph with n nodes, and each campaign-making animal is traversing a Hamiltonian cycle. The condition that no path between two caves is used by more than one campaign-making animal translates to no edge being used by more than one Hamiltonian cycle.Okay, so now the problem is about decomposing the complete graph into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For part (a), we need to prove that for any prime n, the maximum number of campaign-making animals is (n-1)/2. For part (b), we need to find the maximum number when n=9.Starting with part (a), let's recall that in a complete graph with n nodes, the number of edges is n(n-1)/2. Each Hamiltonian cycle uses n edges. So, the maximum number of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles we can have is the total number of edges divided by the number of edges per cycle, which is [n(n-1)/2] / n = (n-1)/2. Since n is prime, (n-1)/2 is an integer, so that's the maximum number.But wait, is this always possible? I know that a complete graph on an odd number of vertices can be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles. Since n is prime and greater than or equal to 3, it's odd (except for n=2, but n>=3). So, for prime n, which is odd, the complete graph can indeed be decomposed into (n-1)/2 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. That proves part (a).For part (b), n=9. Since 9 is not prime, but it's odd, we can still use the same reasoning. The number of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles would be (9-1)/2 = 4. So, the maximum number of campaign-making animals is 4.But wait, let me double-check. For n=9, the complete graph has 9*8/2 = 36 edges. Each Hamiltonian cycle uses 9 edges. So, 36 / 9 = 4. Yes, that matches. So, the maximum number is indeed 4.I think that's it. I've gone through the reasoning, clarified the setup, and applied known graph theory results about decomposing complete graphs into Hamiltonian cycles."},{"question":"If a=(x_{1},y_{1}) and b=(x_{2},y_{2}), then the necessary and sufficient condition for aparallel b can be expressed as dfrac{x_{1}}{x_{2}}= dfrac{y_{1}}{y_{2}}.A: TrueB: FalseC: D:","answer":"Okay, so I have this question about vectors and whether two vectors are parallel. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The vectors are given as a = (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) and b = (x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ). The statement says that the necessary and sufficient condition for a being parallel to b is that x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ equals y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ. I need to figure out if this is true or false.First, I remember that two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. That means there exists some scalar k such that a = k * b. So, if a = (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) and b = (x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ), then x‚ÇÅ = k * x‚ÇÇ and y‚ÇÅ = k * y‚ÇÇ. If I solve for k in both equations, I get k = x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ and k = y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ. Therefore, for these two expressions to be equal, x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ must equal y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ. That seems to support the statement given.But wait, I also recall that sometimes when dealing with vectors, especially in different dimensions, there might be some edge cases or exceptions. For example, what if one of the components is zero? Let me think about that. Suppose x‚ÇÇ is zero. Then, x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ would be undefined unless x‚ÇÅ is also zero. Similarly, if y‚ÇÇ is zero, y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ would be undefined unless y‚ÇÅ is also zero. So, if both x‚ÇÇ and y‚ÇÇ are zero, then b is the zero vector, which is technically parallel to any vector, but the ratio x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ and y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ wouldn't make sense because you can't divide by zero.Hmm, so maybe the statement isn't entirely accurate because it doesn't account for cases where the denominator is zero. In such cases, the ratio isn't defined, but the vectors could still be parallel if they are both zero vectors or if one is a scalar multiple of the other with the appropriate zero components.Another thought: in linear algebra, the condition for two vectors to be parallel is that their cross product is zero. For two-dimensional vectors, the cross product simplifies to x‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÇy‚ÇÅ = 0. This is another way to express that the vectors are scalar multiples of each other. So, if x‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÇy‚ÇÅ = 0, then the vectors are parallel. Let me see how this relates to the given condition x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ = y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ. If I rearrange x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ = y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ, I get x‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ = x‚ÇÇy‚ÇÅ, which is the same as x‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÇy‚ÇÅ = 0. So, algebraically, they are equivalent. But again, this assumes that x‚ÇÇ and y‚ÇÇ are not zero because we're dividing by them. If x‚ÇÇ or y‚ÇÇ is zero, we have to handle those cases separately.So, if x‚ÇÇ is zero, then for the vectors to be parallel, x‚ÇÅ must also be zero, and y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ must be equal to whatever scalar multiple we're using. But if both x‚ÇÇ and y‚ÇÇ are zero, then b is the zero vector, and a must also be the zero vector to be parallel, or a can be any vector since the zero vector is considered parallel to all vectors.Wait, but the original statement says \\"the necessary and sufficient condition for a || b can be expressed as x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ = y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ.\\" It doesn't mention anything about the cases where x‚ÇÇ or y‚ÇÇ is zero. So, does that make the statement false because it doesn't cover all possible cases?I think so. The condition x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ = y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ is necessary and sufficient only when x‚ÇÇ and y‚ÇÇ are non-zero. If x‚ÇÇ or y‚ÇÇ is zero, the condition isn't applicable because you can't divide by zero. Therefore, the statement isn't entirely accurate because it doesn't account for these edge cases.But then, in the context of vectors, sometimes people might implicitly assume that the vectors are non-zero or that the denominators are non-zero when stating such conditions. So, maybe the statement is considered true under certain assumptions.I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to summarize:1. If both vectors are non-zero and neither x‚ÇÇ nor y‚ÇÇ is zero, then x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ = y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ is indeed a necessary and sufficient condition for a || b.2. If x‚ÇÇ or y‚ÇÇ is zero, the condition x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ = y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ isn't valid because of division by zero, but the vectors can still be parallel if the corresponding components are zero.3. The cross product condition x‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÇy‚ÇÅ = 0 is a more general and complete condition that doesn't require division and works for all cases, including when components are zero.Given that the original statement doesn't handle the cases where x‚ÇÇ or y‚ÇÇ is zero, it's not a universally valid necessary and sufficient condition. Therefore, the statement is false.But wait, maybe in some contexts, especially in problems where vectors are given with non-zero components, the condition x‚ÇÅ/x‚ÇÇ = y‚ÇÅ/y‚ÇÇ is acceptable. However, since the question doesn't specify any restrictions on the vectors, I think it's safer to say that the condition isn't universally applicable, making the statement false.So, after considering all these points, I think the answer is B: False."},{"question":"Chuck the llama is tied to the corner of a 3text{ m} by 4text{ m} shed on a 4text{ m} leash.

The shed is a rectangle measuring 3 meters by 4 meters, and Chuck is tied to one of its corners with a 4-meter leash.Since Chuck is tied to a corner, he can move around the outside of the shed. However, the shed itself will block part of the circle Chuck could otherwise cover with his leash.I'll start by calculating the area Chuck can cover if there were no shed. With a 4-meter leash, the area would be a full circle:[text{Area} = pi times 4^2 = 16pi text{ square meters}]But the shed blocks part of this circle.

So, the area Chuck can actually cover around the shed is three-quarters of the full circle:[text{Main Area} = frac{3}{4} times 16pi = 12pi text{ square meters}]Next, I need to consider if Chuck can extend his leash beyond the shed. Since the shed is 3 meters long and Chuck's leash is 4 meters, he has an additional 1 meter of leash beyond the shed. This allows him to cover a quarter-circle with a radius of 1 meter on the other side of the shed:[text{Additional Area} = frac{1}{4} times pi times 1^2 = frac{1}{4}pi text{ square meters}]Finally, I'll add the main area and the additional area to find the total area Chuck can play in:[text{Total Area} = 12pi + frac{1}{4}pi = frac{49}{4}pi = 12.25pi text{ square meters}]"},{"question":"Find the number of moles of Water formed on combining 1 mole of Hydrochrolic acid and 1 mole of Sodium bicarbonate","answer":"Alright, so I have this chemistry problem here: I need to find out how many moles of water are formed when I combine 1 mole of hydrochloric acid (HCl) with 1 mole of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that when acids react with bicarbonates, they usually produce carbon dioxide gas, water, and a salt. So, in this case, HCl is the acid, and NaHCO3 is the bicarbonate. The products should be water, carbon dioxide, and sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a salt.Let me try to write the chemical equation for this reaction. So, HCl reacting with NaHCO3 should produce NaCl, H2O, and CO2. Putting it all together, it looks like this:HCl + NaHCO3 ‚Üí NaCl + H2O + CO2Now, I need to make sure this equation is balanced. Balancing chemical equations is crucial because the number of atoms of each element on the reactant side should equal the number on the product side.Looking at the equation, let's count the atoms:- On the reactant side: 1 H (from HCl), 1 Cl, 1 Na, 1 H, 1 C, 3 O (from NaHCO3).- On the product side: 1 Na, 1 Cl (from NaCl), 2 H, 1 O (from H2O), 1 C, 2 O (from CO2).Wait, that doesn't balance. Let me recount:Reactants:- H: 1 (from HCl) + 1 (from NaHCO3) = 2 H- Cl: 1- Na: 1- C: 1- O: 3 (from NaHCO3)Products:- Na: 1 (from NaCl)- Cl: 1 (from NaCl)- H: 2 (from H2O)- O: 1 (from H2O) + 2 (from CO2) = 3 O- C: 1 (from CO2)Okay, now it balances. So, the balanced equation is:HCl + NaHCO3 ‚Üí NaCl + H2O + CO2Great, so the equation is balanced. Now, I need to determine the mole ratio between the reactants and the products. From the balanced equation, it looks like 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaHCO3 to produce 1 mole of NaCl, 1 mole of H2O, and 1 mole of CO2.Since I have 1 mole of HCl and 1 mole of NaHCO3, they should react completely in a 1:1 ratio. That means all of the HCl and NaHCO3 will be consumed in the reaction, and I'll get 1 mole of water as a product.But wait, what if one of the reactants is in excess? In this case, since both are present in equal moles, neither is in excess, so they should both be completely consumed. Therefore, the amount of water produced should be exactly 1 mole.Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The balanced equation clearly shows a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio for all the substances involved. So, 1 mole of HCl and 1 mole of NaHCO3 will produce 1 mole of H2O, along with 1 mole of NaCl and 1 mole of CO2.Is there any possibility of side reactions or other products? I don't think so in this case. The reaction between HCl and NaHCO3 is straightforward and produces only these three products: NaCl, H2O, and CO2.Also, considering the stoichiometry, since both reactants are in the exact stoichiometric ratio required by the balanced equation, there should be no leftover reactants. This means that the theoretical yield of water is 1 mole.To summarize:- Reactants: 1 mole HCl + 1 mole NaHCO3- Products: 1 mole NaCl + 1 mole H2O + 1 mole CO2Therefore, the number of moles of water formed is 1 mole."},{"question":"Suppose that all four of the numbers [3 - sqrt{8}, ;5+sqrt{12}, ;16 - 3sqrt{7}, ;-sqrt{3}] are roots of the same nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients. What is the smallest possible degree of the polynomial?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible degree of a nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients that has four given numbers as roots. The numbers are (3 - sqrt{8}), (5 + sqrt{12}), (16 - 3sqrt{7}), and (-sqrt{3}). First off, I remember that if a polynomial has rational coefficients, then any irrational root must have its conjugate also as a root. This is because the polynomial can be factored into polynomials with rational coefficients, and irrational roots come in pairs to ensure that the coefficients remain rational. So, for each of these given roots, I need to consider their conjugates as well.Let me list out the given roots and their conjugates:1. (3 - sqrt{8}): The conjugate here would be (3 + sqrt{8}).2. (5 + sqrt{12}): The conjugate is (5 - sqrt{12}).3. (16 - 3sqrt{7}): The conjugate is (16 + 3sqrt{7}).4. (-sqrt{3}): The conjugate is (sqrt{3}).So, each of these four roots brings along another root, their conjugate. That means instead of just four roots, we actually have eight roots in total for the polynomial. Now, each pair of conjugate roots can form a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients. Let me try to write these quadratic polynomials out:1. For (3 - sqrt{8}) and (3 + sqrt{8}):   [   (x - (3 - sqrt{8}))(x - (3 + sqrt{8})) = (x - 3 + sqrt{8})(x - 3 - sqrt{8})   ]   Multiplying these out:   [   (x - 3)^2 - (sqrt{8})^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 - 8 = x^2 - 6x + 1   ]   So, the quadratic polynomial is (x^2 - 6x + 1).2. For (5 + sqrt{12}) and (5 - sqrt{12}):   [   (x - (5 + sqrt{12}))(x - (5 - sqrt{12})) = (x - 5 - sqrt{12})(x - 5 + sqrt{12})   ]   Multiplying these out:   [   (x - 5)^2 - (sqrt{12})^2 = x^2 - 10x + 25 - 12 = x^2 - 10x + 13   ]   So, the quadratic polynomial is (x^2 - 10x + 13).3. For (16 - 3sqrt{7}) and (16 + 3sqrt{7}):   [   (x - (16 - 3sqrt{7}))(x - (16 + 3sqrt{7})) = (x - 16 + 3sqrt{7})(x - 16 - 3sqrt{7})   ]   Multiplying these out:   [   (x - 16)^2 - (3sqrt{7})^2 = x^2 - 32x + 256 - 63 = x^2 - 32x + 193   ]   Wait, let me check that calculation again. (3sqrt{7}) squared is (9 times 7 = 63), and (16) squared is (256). So, subtracting 63 from 256 gives (193). So, the quadratic polynomial is (x^2 - 32x + 193).4. For (-sqrt{3}) and (sqrt{3}):   [   (x + sqrt{3})(x - sqrt{3}) = x^2 - (sqrt{3})^2 = x^2 - 3   ]   So, the quadratic polynomial is (x^2 - 3).Okay, so now I have four quadratic polynomials, each with rational coefficients, corresponding to each pair of conjugate roots. Each quadratic is irreducible over the rationals, meaning they can't be factored further into polynomials with rational coefficients.Since the original polynomial must have all these roots, it must be a multiple of each of these quadratic polynomials. Therefore, the minimal polynomial that includes all these roots is the least common multiple (LCM) of these quadratics. But since all these quadratics are irreducible and distinct, their LCM is just their product. So, the minimal polynomial is the product of these four quadratics:[(x^2 - 6x + 1)(x^2 - 10x + 13)(x^2 - 32x + 193)(x^2 - 3)]Each quadratic is degree 2, and since they are multiplied together, the total degree is (2 times 4 = 8). Therefore, the smallest possible degree of such a polynomial is 8.Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me recap:- Each irrational root requires its conjugate to be a root as well, doubling the number of roots.- Each pair forms a quadratic with rational coefficients.- Since all quadratics are irreducible, the minimal polynomial is their product.- The degree is the sum of the degrees of each factor, which is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.Yep, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the answer should be 8.**Final Answer**The smallest possible degree of the polynomial is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Every day, the value of a stock rises by exactly two dollars in the morning, and then falls by a certain amount in the afternoon. If the stock's value at the start of the first day is 100, the stock's value will first reach 200 on the 100th day. How much does the stock fall in the afternoon?","answer":"First, I need to determine how much the stock falls in the afternoon each day. The stock starts at 100 and reaches 200 on the 100th day. This means there is a total increase of 100 over 99 days because on the 100th day, the stock only needs to rise by 2 in the morning to reach 200.Each day, the stock rises by 2 in the morning and falls by an unknown amount ( x ) in the afternoon. Therefore, the net change in the stock's value each day is ( 2 - x ).Over 99 days, the total increase in the stock's value is ( (2 - x) times 99 ). Since the total increase needed is 100, I can set up the equation:[(2 - x) times 99 = 100]Solving for ( x ):[198 - 99x = 100]Subtract 198 from both sides:[-99x = -98]Divide both sides by -99:[x = frac{98}{99}]Therefore, the stock falls by ( frac{98}{99} ) dollars in the afternoon each day."},{"question":"Given the sets A={x|x^{2}-x-2 < 0} and B={x|log_{4}x < 0.5}, then („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: Acap B=varnothingB: Acap B=BC: complement_{U}Acup B=mathbb{R}D: Acup B=B","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two sets, A and B, defined by inequalities. I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D is correct. Let me take it step by step.First, let's understand what set A is. It's defined as A = {x | x¬≤ - x - 2 < 0}. Hmm, this is a quadratic inequality. I remember that to solve quadratic inequalities, I should first find the roots of the quadratic equation and then determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is negative.So, let me solve x¬≤ - x - 2 = 0. I can use the quadratic formula: x = [1 ¬± ‚àö(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ¬± 3] / 2. That gives me x = (1 + 3)/2 = 2 and x = (1 - 3)/2 = -1. So, the roots are x = -1 and x = 2.Now, the quadratic x¬≤ - x - 2 can be factored as (x - 2)(x + 1). To find where this is less than zero, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are at x = -1 and x = 2. So, the number line is divided into three intervals: (-‚àû, -1), (-1, 2), and (2, ‚àû).Let me test each interval:1. For x < -1, say x = -2: (-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-4)(-1) = 4, which is positive. So, the expression is positive here.2. For -1 < x < 2, say x = 0: (0 - 2)(0 + 1) = (-2)(1) = -2, which is negative. So, the expression is negative here.3. For x > 2, say x = 3: (3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (1)(4) = 4, which is positive. So, the expression is positive here.Since we're looking for where the expression is less than zero, the solution is the interval (-1, 2). Therefore, set A is (-1, 2).Alright, moving on to set B. It's defined as B = {x | log‚ÇÑx < 0.5}. Hmm, logarithmic inequalities can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this.First, I know that log‚ÇÑx is defined only for x > 0. So, the domain of B is x > 0.Now, log‚ÇÑx < 0.5. To solve this, I can rewrite the inequality in exponential form. Remember that log_b a = c is equivalent to b^c = a.So, log‚ÇÑx < 0.5 is equivalent to x < 4^{0.5}. Since 4^{0.5} is the square root of 4, which is 2. Therefore, x < 2.But wait, we also have the domain x > 0. So, combining these, set B is (0, 2).Okay, so now I have both sets defined:- A = (-1, 2)- B = (0, 2)Now, let's analyze the options given.Option A: A ‚à© B = ‚àÖ. That is, the intersection of A and B is empty. But looking at the intervals, A is from -1 to 2, and B is from 0 to 2. Their intersection should be from 0 to 2, which is not empty. So, option A is incorrect.Option B: A ‚à© B = B. Let's see. A ‚à© B is the overlap between A and B, which is (0, 2). And set B is also (0, 2). So, yes, A ‚à© B equals B. So, option B is correct.But let me check the other options just to be thorough.Option C: ‚àÅ‚ÇêU A ‚à™ B = ‚Ñù. Hmm, I need to parse this. ‚àÅ‚ÇêU A is the complement of A with respect to the universal set U. Assuming U is ‚Ñù, the complement of A would be (-‚àû, -1] ‚à™ [2, ‚àû). Then, taking the union with B, which is (0, 2), we get (-‚àû, -1] ‚à™ (0, ‚àû). This is not equal to ‚Ñù because the interval (-1, 0] is missing. So, option C is incorrect.Option D: A ‚à™ B = B. A ‚à™ B would be the union of (-1, 2) and (0, 2), which is (-1, 2). But set B is (0, 2). So, (-1, 2) is not equal to (0, 2). Therefore, option D is incorrect.So, after checking all options, only option B is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"The difference between the larger root and the smaller root of x^2 - px + (p^2 - 1)/4 = 0 is: textbf{(A)} 0qquadtextbf{(B)} 1qquadtextbf{(C)} 2qquadtextbf{(D)} pqquadtextbf{(E)} p+1","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: ( x^2 - px + frac{p^2 - 1}{4} = 0 ). I need to find the difference between the larger root and the smaller root. Hmm, let's see. I remember that for any quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the roots can be found using the quadratic formula: ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ). In this case, the equation is already in standard form, so ( a = 1 ), ( b = -p ), and ( c = frac{p^2 - 1}{4} ). Plugging these into the quadratic formula, the roots would be:( x = frac{p pm sqrt{p^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot frac{p^2 - 1}{4}}}{2 cdot 1} ).Let me simplify the discriminant inside the square root first. The discriminant is ( p^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot frac{p^2 - 1}{4} ). Calculating that: ( p^2 - (4 cdot frac{p^2 - 1}{4}) ). The 4s cancel out, so it becomes ( p^2 - (p^2 - 1) ). Simplifying further: ( p^2 - p^2 + 1 = 1 ). Oh, that's nice! So the discriminant is 1. That means the roots are:( x = frac{p pm sqrt{1}}{2} ).Which simplifies to:( x = frac{p + 1}{2} ) and ( x = frac{p - 1}{2} ).So the two roots are ( frac{p + 1}{2} ) and ( frac{p - 1}{2} ). Now, to find the difference between the larger root and the smaller root, I subtract the smaller one from the larger one:( frac{p + 1}{2} - frac{p - 1}{2} ).Let me compute that:First, subtract the numerators:( (p + 1) - (p - 1) = p + 1 - p + 1 = 2 ).Then divide by 2:( frac{2}{2} = 1 ).So the difference between the larger root and the smaller root is 1.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the discriminant: ( p^2 - 4ac ). Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -p ), ( c = frac{p^2 - 1}{4} ). So discriminant is ( (-p)^2 - 4(1)(frac{p^2 - 1}{4}) ). That's ( p^2 - (p^2 - 1) ), which is indeed 1. So the square root of 1 is 1, so the roots are ( frac{p + 1}{2} ) and ( frac{p - 1}{2} ). Subtracting them: ( frac{p + 1}{2} - frac{p - 1}{2} = frac{(p + 1) - (p - 1)}{2} = frac{2}{2} = 1 ). Yep, that seems correct.I think that's solid. The difference is 1, so the answer should be B) 1.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"The parametric equations are given as follows:begin{cases}x = 4t + 1 y = -2t - 5end{cases}where t is the parameter.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that the standard equation of a circle is ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2), where ((h, k)) is the center of the circle and (r) is the radius. Since AB is the diameter, I think the center of the circle should be the midpoint of AB. That makes sense because the diameter passes through the center.So, to find the midpoint, I can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint (M) between two points (A(x_1, y_1)) and (B(x_2, y_2)) is given by:[M = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right)]Plugging in the coordinates of A and B:[M_x = frac{1 + (-5)}{2} = frac{-4}{2} = -2][M_y = frac{-4 + 4}{2} = frac{0}{2} = 0]So, the midpoint, which is the center of the circle, is at (-2, 0). Got that down.Next, I need to find the radius of the circle. Since AB is the diameter, the radius is half the length of AB. To find the length of AB, I can use the distance formula:[text{Distance} = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}]Substituting the coordinates of A and B:[text{Distance} = sqrt{(-5 - 1)^2 + (4 - (-4))^2} = sqrt{(-6)^2 + (8)^2} = sqrt{36 + 64} = sqrt{100} = 10]So, the length of AB is 10 units, which means the radius (r) is half of that, so (r = 5).Now, with the center at (-2, 0) and radius 5, I can plug these into the standard equation of a circle:[(x - (-2))^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 5^2]Simplifying that:[(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 25]Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The midpoint seems correct: averaging 1 and -5 gives -2, and averaging -4 and 4 gives 0. The distance calculation also looks right: the differences in x and y coordinates are -6 and 8, squaring those gives 36 and 64, adding them gives 100, and the square root of 100 is 10. Dividing by 2 gives a radius of 5. Plugging into the standard equation formula seems correct as well.I think that's it! The standard equation of the circle with AB as its diameter is ((x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 25)."},{"question":"Find the units digit of the following within the indicated number base: 53_8 + 64_8","answer":"First, I need to add the units digits of the two numbers in base 8.

The dimensions are 4 meters in length, 2 meters in width, and 4 meters in height.

There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so:- Length: 4 meters √ó 100 = 400 centimeters- Width: 2 meters √ó 100 = 200 centimeters- Height: 4 meters √ó 100 = 400 centimetersNow, I'll calculate the volume of the wooden box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:Volume of wooden box = Length √ó Width √ó HeightVolume of wooden box = 400 cm √ó 200 cm √ó 400 cm = 32,000,000 cubic centimeters (cm¬≥)Next, I'll calculate the volume of one small box.

It says that œÄ/2 is less than alpha, which is less than œÄ, and that 3 times the sine of 2Œ± equals 2 times the cosine of alpha. I need to find the value of sine of (alpha minus 9œÄ/2). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First off, the angle alpha is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. That means alpha is in the second quadrant, right? So, in the second quadrant, sine is positive, and cosine is negative. That's good to remember because it will affect the signs of the trigonometric functions later on.Now, the equation given is 3 sin 2Œ± = 2 cos Œ±. I know that sin 2Œ± is a double-angle identity, which can be written as 2 sin Œ± cos Œ±. So, substituting that into the equation, I get:3 * 2 sin Œ± cos Œ± = 2 cos Œ±Simplifying that, it becomes:6 sin Œ± cos Œ± = 2 cos Œ±Hmm, okay, so I can divide both sides by cos Œ±, but wait, I should make sure that cos Œ± isn't zero. But since alpha is between œÄ/2 and œÄ, cos Œ± is negative, not zero, so it's safe to divide both sides by cos Œ±. Let's do that:6 sin Œ± = 2Dividing both sides by 6:sin Œ± = 2/6 = 1/3Alright, so sin Œ± is 1/3. Since alpha is in the second quadrant, as we established earlier, sin Œ± is positive, which matches our result. Good.Now, I need to find sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the angle first. Let's see, 9œÄ/2 is the same as 4œÄ + œÄ/2. Since sine has a period of 2œÄ, subtracting 4œÄ from the angle won't change the value of the sine function. So, sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2) is the same as sin(alpha - œÄ/2 - 4œÄ), which simplifies to sin(alpha - œÄ/2).Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 9œÄ/2 is indeed 4œÄ + œÄ/2, so subtracting 9œÄ/2 is like subtracting 4œÄ and then subtracting œÄ/2. Since sine has a period of 2œÄ, subtracting 4œÄ (which is two full periods) doesn't change the value. So, sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2) = sin(alpha - œÄ/2). That seems correct.Now, sin(alpha - œÄ/2) can be expanded using the sine subtraction formula:sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin BSo, applying that here:sin(alpha - œÄ/2) = sin alpha cos(œÄ/2) - cos alpha sin(œÄ/2)I know that cos(œÄ/2) is 0 and sin(œÄ/2) is 1. So, substituting those values in:sin(alpha - œÄ/2) = sin alpha * 0 - cos alpha * 1 = -cos alphaSo, sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2) simplifies to -cos alpha. Therefore, if I can find cos alpha, I can find the value of sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2).We already found that sin alpha is 1/3. To find cos alpha, we can use the Pythagorean identity:sin¬≤ alpha + cos¬≤ alpha = 1Plugging in sin alpha:(1/3)¬≤ + cos¬≤ alpha = 11/9 + cos¬≤ alpha = 1cos¬≤ alpha = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9Taking the square root of both sides:cos alpha = ¬±‚àö(8/9) = ¬±2‚àö2/3But since alpha is in the second quadrant, where cosine is negative, we take the negative value:cos alpha = -2‚àö2/3Therefore, sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2) = -cos alpha = -(-2‚àö2/3) = 2‚àö2/3So, the value of sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2) is 2‚àö2/3.Wait, let me just go through that one more time to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the equation:3 sin 2Œ± = 2 cos Œ±We used the double-angle identity for sine, which is correct. Then we simplified and found sin alpha = 1/3. That seems right. Then, for sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2), we simplified the angle by recognizing the periodicity of sine, which is a good approach.Using the sine subtraction formula, we correctly expanded it and used the known values of sine and cosine at œÄ/2. Then, using the Pythagorean identity, we found cos alpha, remembering to take the negative value because alpha is in the second quadrant. Finally, substituting back into the expression, we got 2‚àö2/3.I think that all checks out. I don't see any errors in the steps I took. So, I'm confident that the value of sin(alpha - 9œÄ/2) is indeed 2‚àö2/3."},{"question":"As shown in Figure 2.5.1, take any point ( M ) on the line segment ( AB ).

First, I should probably draw a diagram to get a better sense of what's going on. Since I can't actually draw it right now, I'll try to imagine it. So, AB is a straight line segment, and M is somewhere between A and B. Then, from AM, we construct square AMCD. That means starting at A, moving to M, then constructing a square upwards (assuming the same side) so that AM is one side, and then CD is the opposite side. Similarly, from BM, we construct square BEHM, so starting at B, moving to M, then constructing another square upwards, making BM one side and EH the opposite side.Now, the circumcircles of these squares intersect at M and N. So, each square has its own circumcircle, which passes through all four vertices of the square. Since both squares share the point M, their circumcircles must intersect at M and another point N. I need to find something about N that shows it lies on the line BC.Let me recall some properties of squares and their circumcircles. In a square, all sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. The diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at 90 degrees. Also, the circumcircle of a square has its center at the intersection of the diagonals, and all four vertices lie on the circle.So, for square AMCD, the circumcircle passes through A, M, C, and D. Similarly, for square BEHM, the circumcircle passes through B, E, H, and M. Since both circumcircles pass through M, their other intersection point is N.I need to find a relationship between N, B, and C. Maybe I can use some angle properties or cyclic quadrilaterals here. Let me think about the angles involved.Since N lies on the circumcircle of AMCD, the angles subtended by the same chord should be equal. Similarly, N lies on the circumcircle of BEHM, so the same applies there. Maybe if I can find some angles that add up to 180 degrees, that would show that points are collinear.Wait, another thought: if I can show that angle BNC is 180 degrees, that would mean points B, N, and C are collinear. So, how can I find angle BNC?Alternatively, maybe I can use power of a point or some similar triangles. Let me see.First, let's consider the circumcircle of square AMCD. Since AMCD is a square, the angle at M, angle AMC, is 90 degrees. Similarly, in square BEHM, angle at M, angle BHM, is also 90 degrees.But N is another intersection point of the two circumcircles. So, maybe I can relate angles at N with points A, M, C and B, E, H.Wait, since N is on both circumcircles, the angles subtended by the same chord should be equal. So, for example, in the circumcircle of AMCD, angle ANC should be equal to angle AMC because they subtend the same chord AC. But angle AMC is 90 degrees because it's a square. So, angle ANC is also 90 degrees.Similarly, in the circumcircle of BEHM, angle BNC should be equal to angle BHM because they subtend the same chord BM. But angle BHM is 90 degrees because it's a square. So, angle BNC is also 90 degrees.Wait, hold on. If angle ANC is 90 degrees and angle BNC is 90 degrees, does that mean something?Let me see. If I have two angles at N: angle ANC and angle BNC, both equal to 90 degrees. If I add them together, angle ANB would be 180 degrees. But wait, angle ANB is the angle at N between points A, N, and B. If that's 180 degrees, that would mean points A, N, and B are collinear. But that's not necessarily the case here.Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me double-check.In the circumcircle of AMCD, angle ANC is equal to angle AMC because they subtend the same chord AC. Since angle AMC is 90 degrees, angle ANC is also 90 degrees. That seems correct.In the circumcircle of BEHM, angle BNC is equal to angle BHM because they subtend the same chord BM. Since angle BHM is 90 degrees, angle BNC is also 90 degrees. That also seems correct.But how does that help me? If both angle ANC and angle BNC are 90 degrees, then point N must lie somewhere such that it forms two right angles with points A, C and B, C. Wait, that might mean that N lies on the intersection of two circles: one with diameter AC and another with diameter BC. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.Alternatively, maybe I can consider triangle BNC. If angle BNC is 90 degrees, then N lies on the circle with diameter BC. But I need to show that N lies on the line BC, not just on the circle.Hmm, perhaps I need to use another property. Let me think about the power of point N with respect to both circumcircles.Wait, since N lies on both circumcircles, the power of N with respect to both circles is zero. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Another idea: maybe I can use spiral similarity or some transformation that maps one square to the other. Since both squares are constructed on AB, perhaps there's a rotation or reflection that relates them.Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Assign coordinates to points A, B, M, and then construct the squares and find the coordinates of N. Then, check if B, N, and C are collinear.Let me try that approach. Let's place point A at (0, 0) and point B at (b, 0) for some positive b. Let point M be at (m, 0), where 0 < m < b.Now, construct square AMCD on the same side of AB. Since AM is from (0,0) to (m,0), the square AMCD will have points A(0,0), M(m,0), C(m + 0, 0 + m) = (m, m), and D(0, m). Wait, no, that would make AMCD a square, but actually, the direction depends on the orientation.Wait, if we construct the square on the same side of AB, which is the x-axis in my coordinate system, then the squares will be above the x-axis. So, from AM, moving upwards, the square AMCD would have points A(0,0), M(m,0), C(m, m), and D(0, m). Similarly, square BEHM would have points B(b,0), E(b, m'), H(b - m', m'), and M(b - m', 0). Wait, but M is already at (m,0). Hmm, maybe I need to adjust.Wait, actually, since BEHM is constructed on BM, which is from B(b,0) to M(m,0). So, the length of BM is b - m. So, the square BEHM would have sides of length b - m. Starting from B(b,0), moving to M(m,0), then constructing the square upwards. So, the next point after M would be H(m, -(b - m)), but since we are constructing on the same side of AB, which is above AB, so it should be H(m, b - m). Wait, no, direction matters.Actually, to construct the square BEHM on BM, starting from B(b,0), moving to M(m,0), then turning 90 degrees upwards (since it's on the same side as AMCD). So, from M(m,0), moving upwards (positive y-direction) by the length BM, which is b - m. So, point H would be at (m, b - m). Then, point E would be at (b, b - m). Wait, let me verify.From B(b,0) to M(m,0) is vector (- (b - m), 0). Rotating this vector 90 degrees counterclockwise would give (0, b - m). So, adding this to M(m,0) gives H(m, b - m). Then, from H(m, b - m), moving in the direction opposite to BM, which would be vector (b - m, 0), but rotated 90 degrees, which is (0, b - m). Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating it.Alternatively, since BEHM is a square, the sides BE and EH should be equal and at right angles. From B(b,0) to E, then to H, then to M(m,0). So, if BM is the base, then BE should be perpendicular to BM. Since BM is along the x-axis from B to M, BE should be vertical upwards from B. So, E would be at (b, b - m). Then, from E(b, b - m), moving left to H, which would be at (m, b - m), and then down to M(m,0). Yes, that makes sense.So, square BEHM has points B(b,0), E(b, b - m), H(m, b - m), and M(m,0).Similarly, square AMCD has points A(0,0), M(m,0), C(m, m), and D(0, m).Now, the circumcircle of AMCD passes through A(0,0), M(m,0), C(m, m), and D(0, m). Let me find the equation of this circle.The general equation of a circle is x¬≤ + y¬≤ + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Plugging in A(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 ‚áí F = 0.Plugging in M(m,0): m¬≤ + 0 + Dm + 0 + 0 = 0 ‚áí D = -m.Plugging in C(m, m): m¬≤ + m¬≤ + Dm + Em + F = 0 ‚áí 2m¬≤ - m¬≤ + Em = 0 ‚áí m¬≤ + Em = 0 ‚áí E = -m.So, the equation of the circumcircle of AMCD is x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m x - m y = 0.Similarly, let's find the equation of the circumcircle of BEHM. Points B(b,0), E(b, b - m), H(m, b - m), and M(m,0).Using the general equation x¬≤ + y¬≤ + Gx + Hy + K = 0.Plugging in B(b,0): b¬≤ + 0 + Gb + 0 + K = 0 ‚áí Gb + K = -b¬≤.Plugging in E(b, b - m): b¬≤ + (b - m)¬≤ + Gb + H(b - m) + K = 0.Plugging in H(m, b - m): m¬≤ + (b - m)¬≤ + Gm + H(b - m) + K = 0.Plugging in M(m,0): m¬≤ + 0 + Gm + 0 + K = 0 ‚áí Gm + K = -m¬≤.So, we have four equations:1. Gb + K = -b¬≤.2. b¬≤ + (b - m)¬≤ + Gb + H(b - m) + K = 0.3. m¬≤ + (b - m)¬≤ + Gm + H(b - m) + K = 0.4. Gm + K = -m¬≤.Let me subtract equation 4 from equation 1:Gb + K - (Gm + K) = -b¬≤ - (-m¬≤) ‚áí G(b - m) = -b¬≤ + m¬≤ ‚áí G = (m¬≤ - b¬≤)/(b - m) = -(b¬≤ - m¬≤)/(b - m) = -(b + m).So, G = -(b + m).From equation 1: Gb + K = -b¬≤ ‚áí -(b + m)b + K = -b¬≤ ‚áí -b¬≤ - bm + K = -b¬≤ ‚áí K = bm.So, K = bm.Now, let's use equation 4: Gm + K = -m¬≤ ‚áí -(b + m)m + bm = -m¬≤ ‚áí -bm - m¬≤ + bm = -m¬≤ ‚áí -m¬≤ = -m¬≤. Okay, consistent.Now, let's use equation 2: b¬≤ + (b - m)¬≤ + Gb + H(b - m) + K = 0.Plugging in G = -(b + m), K = bm:b¬≤ + (b¬≤ - 2bm + m¬≤) + (-(b + m))b + H(b - m) + bm = 0.Simplify:b¬≤ + b¬≤ - 2bm + m¬≤ - b¬≤ - bm + H(b - m) + bm = 0.Combine like terms:(b¬≤ + b¬≤ - b¬≤) + (-2bm - bm + bm) + m¬≤ + H(b - m) = 0 ‚áí b¬≤ - 2bm + m¬≤ + H(b - m) = 0.So, H(b - m) = -b¬≤ + 2bm - m¬≤ ‚áí H = (-b¬≤ + 2bm - m¬≤)/(b - m).Factor numerator: -b¬≤ + 2bm - m¬≤ = -(b¬≤ - 2bm + m¬≤) = -(b - m)¬≤.Thus, H = -(b - m)¬≤ / (b - m) = -(b - m).So, H = -(b - m).Therefore, the equation of the circumcircle of BEHM is x¬≤ + y¬≤ - (b + m)x - (b - m)y + bm = 0.Now, we have two circles:1. Circumcircle of AMCD: x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m x - m y = 0.2. Circumcircle of BEHM: x¬≤ + y¬≤ - (b + m)x - (b - m)y + bm = 0.To find their intersection points M and N, let's subtract the first equation from the second:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - (b + m)x - (b - m)y + bm) - (x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m x - m y) = 0.Simplify:- (b + m)x - (b - m)y + bm - (-m x - m y) = 0 ‚áí- (b + m)x - (b - m)y + bm + m x + m y = 0 ‚áí(-b - m + m)x + (-b + m + m)y + bm = 0 ‚áí(-b)x + (-b + 2m)y + bm = 0.So, -b x + (-b + 2m) y + bm = 0.Let me write this as:b x + (b - 2m) y = bm.This is the equation of the radical axis of the two circles, which is the line containing their intersection points M and N.We know that M is at (m, 0). Let's verify:b m + (b - 2m) * 0 = bm ‚áí bm = bm. Correct.So, the radical axis passes through M(m, 0). Now, we need to find the other intersection point N.Let me solve the system of equations:1. x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m x - m y = 0.2. b x + (b - 2m) y = bm.Let me solve equation 2 for x:b x = bm - (b - 2m) y ‚áí x = m - [(b - 2m)/b] y.Now, substitute x into equation 1:[m - (b - 2m)/b y]^2 + y^2 - m [m - (b - 2m)/b y] - m y = 0.Let me expand this step by step.First, expand [m - (b - 2m)/b y]^2:= m¬≤ - 2m*(b - 2m)/b y + [(b - 2m)/b y]^2.= m¬≤ - (2m(b - 2m)/b) y + (b - 2m)¬≤ / b¬≤ y¬≤.Now, the entire equation becomes:[m¬≤ - (2m(b - 2m)/b) y + (b - 2m)¬≤ / b¬≤ y¬≤] + y¬≤ - m [m - (b - 2m)/b y] - m y = 0.Simplify term by term:First term: m¬≤ - (2m(b - 2m)/b) y + (b - 2m)¬≤ / b¬≤ y¬≤.Second term: + y¬≤.Third term: - m [m - (b - 2m)/b y] = -m¬≤ + (m(b - 2m)/b) y.Fourth term: - m y.So, combining all terms:m¬≤ - (2m(b - 2m)/b) y + (b - 2m)¬≤ / b¬≤ y¬≤ + y¬≤ - m¬≤ + (m(b - 2m)/b) y - m y = 0.Simplify:m¬≤ - m¬≤ cancels out.Now, terms with y:- (2m(b - 2m)/b) y + (m(b - 2m)/b) y - m y.Factor y:[ -2m(b - 2m)/b + m(b - 2m)/b - m ] y.Simplify inside the brackets:First term: -2m(b - 2m)/b.Second term: + m(b - 2m)/b.Third term: - m.Combine first and second terms:(-2m + m)(b - 2m)/b = (-m)(b - 2m)/b.So, total:(-m(b - 2m)/b - m) y.Factor out -m:- m [ (b - 2m)/b + 1 ] y.Simplify inside the brackets:(b - 2m)/b + 1 = (b - 2m + b)/b = (2b - 2m)/b = 2(b - m)/b.Thus, the y terms become:- m * 2(b - m)/b * y = -2m(b - m)/b y.Now, terms with y¬≤:(b - 2m)¬≤ / b¬≤ y¬≤ + y¬≤.Factor y¬≤:[ (b - 2m)¬≤ / b¬≤ + 1 ] y¬≤.Simplify:= [ (b¬≤ - 4m b + 4m¬≤) / b¬≤ + 1 ] y¬≤.= [ (b¬≤ - 4m b + 4m¬≤ + b¬≤) / b¬≤ ] y¬≤.= [ (2b¬≤ - 4m b + 4m¬≤) / b¬≤ ] y¬≤.Factor numerator:2(b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) / b¬≤.Wait, actually, 2b¬≤ - 4m b + 4m¬≤ = 2(b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤). Hmm, not sure if that helps.So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:[2(b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤)/b¬≤] y¬≤ - [2m(b - m)/b] y = 0.Factor out 2/b:(2/b) [ (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤)/b y¬≤ - m(b - m) y ] = 0.Since 2/b ‚â† 0, we have:(b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤)/b y¬≤ - m(b - m) y = 0.Multiply through by b to eliminate denominators:(b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) y¬≤ - m b (b - m) y = 0.Factor y:y [ (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) y - m b (b - m) ] = 0.So, solutions are y = 0 and (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) y - m b (b - m) = 0.We already know y = 0 corresponds to point M(m, 0). The other solution is:(b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) y = m b (b - m).Thus,y = [ m b (b - m) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Simplify the denominator:b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤ = (b - m)^2 + m¬≤.Not sure if that helps, but let's keep it as is.So, y = [ m b (b - m) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Now, let's find x from earlier:x = m - [(b - 2m)/b] y.Plugging in y:x = m - [(b - 2m)/b] * [ m b (b - m) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ].Simplify:= m - (b - 2m) * m (b - m) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= m - [ m (b - 2m)(b - m) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Let me compute the numerator:m (b - 2m)(b - m) = m [ b(b - m) - 2m(b - m) ] = m [ b¬≤ - b m - 2m b + 2m¬≤ ] = m [ b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤ ].So,x = m - [ m (b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Let me write m as m (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) to have a common denominator:x = [ m (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) - m (b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Factor m:= m [ (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) - (b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Simplify inside the brackets:b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤ - b¬≤ + 3m b - 2m¬≤ = (b¬≤ - b¬≤) + (-2m b + 3m b) + (2m¬≤ - 2m¬≤) = m b.Thus,x = m * m b / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) = m¬≤ b / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).So, the coordinates of N are:x = m¬≤ b / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤),y = m b (b - m) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Now, I need to check if points B(b,0), N(x,y), and C(m, m) are collinear.To check collinearity, the slope between B and N should be equal to the slope between N and C.First, let's compute the slope between B(b,0) and N(x,y):Slope BN = (y - 0)/(x - b) = y / (x - b).Similarly, slope NC = (m - y)/(m - x).If these slopes are equal, then B, N, C are collinear.Let me compute slope BN:y / (x - b) = [ m b (b - m) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ] / [ (m¬≤ b / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤)) - b ].Simplify denominator:= [ m¬≤ b - b (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= [ m¬≤ b - b¬≥ + 2m b¬≤ - 2m¬≤ b ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Factor b in numerator:= b [ m¬≤ - b¬≤ + 2m b - 2m¬≤ ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Simplify inside the brackets:= b [ -b¬≤ + 2m b - m¬≤ ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Note that -b¬≤ + 2m b - m¬≤ = -(b¬≤ - 2m b + m¬≤) = -(b - m)^2.Thus,Denominator becomes:= b [ - (b - m)^2 ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).So, slope BN:= [ m b (b - m) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ] / [ -b (b - m)^2 / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ].Simplify:= [ m b (b - m) ] / [ -b (b - m)^2 ].Cancel b and (b - m):= m / [ - (b - m) ] = -m / (b - m).Now, compute slope NC:(m - y)/(m - x).Compute numerator:m - y = m - [ m b (b - m) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ].= [ m (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) - m b (b - m) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Factor m:= m [ b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤ - b (b - m) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Simplify inside the brackets:= m [ b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤ - b¬≤ + b m ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= m [ (-2m b + b m) + 2m¬≤ ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= m [ (-m b) + 2m¬≤ ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= m [ -m b + 2m¬≤ ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= m [ m (2m - b) ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= m¬≤ (2m - b) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Now, compute denominator:m - x = m - [ m¬≤ b / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ].= [ m (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) - m¬≤ b ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= [ m b¬≤ - 2m¬≤ b + 2m¬≥ - m¬≤ b ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).= [ m b¬≤ - 3m¬≤ b + 2m¬≥ ] / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Factor numerator:= m (b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤).Thus, slope NC:= [ m¬≤ (2m - b) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ] / [ m (b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤) / (b¬≤ - 2m b + 2m¬≤) ].Simplify:= [ m¬≤ (2m - b) ] / [ m (b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤) ].Cancel m:= m (2m - b) / (b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤).Factor denominator:b¬≤ - 3m b + 2m¬≤ = (b - m)(b - 2m).Thus,slope NC = m (2m - b) / [ (b - m)(b - 2m) ].Note that 2m - b = - (b - 2m), so:slope NC = m [ - (b - 2m) ] / [ (b - m)(b - 2m) ] = -m / (b - m).So, slope NC = -m / (b - m).Earlier, slope BN was also -m / (b - m). Therefore, slopes BN and NC are equal, which means points B, N, and C are collinear.Therefore, we've proven that points B, N, and C lie on a straight line."},{"question":"Let ( a, b ), and ( c ) be positive real numbers. Determine the largest total number of real roots that the following three polynomials may have among them: ( ax^2 + bx + c ), ( bx^2 + cx + a ), and ( cx^2 + ax + b ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the largest total number of real roots that three quadratic polynomials can have among them. The polynomials are given as ( ax^2 + bx + c ), ( bx^2 + cx + a ), and ( cx^2 + ax + b ), where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are positive real numbers. First, I remember that for a quadratic equation ( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 ) to have real roots, its discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant is ( D = B^2 - 4AC ). So, if ( D geq 0 ), the quadratic has real roots; otherwise, it doesn't.Let me write down the discriminants for each of the given polynomials:1. For ( ax^2 + bx + c ), the discriminant is ( D_1 = b^2 - 4ac ).2. For ( bx^2 + cx + a ), the discriminant is ( D_2 = c^2 - 4ba ).3. For ( cx^2 + ax + b ), the discriminant is ( D_3 = a^2 - 4cb ).Now, if all three discriminants are non-negative, that would mean all three quadratics have real roots. But I suspect that might not be possible because of the relationships between ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). Let me explore that.Suppose all three discriminants are non-negative:- ( b^2 geq 4ac )- ( c^2 geq 4ab )- ( a^2 geq 4bc )If I multiply these three inequalities together, I get:[ (b^2)(c^2)(a^2) geq (4ac)(4ab)(4bc) ]Simplifying the right side:[ (abc)^2 geq 64(abc)^2 ]Wait, that simplifies to:[ 1 geq 64 ]Which is clearly not true. So, this means that it's impossible for all three discriminants to be non-negative at the same time. Therefore, at least one of the quadratics must have no real roots.So, the maximum number of real roots can't be six (since each quadratic can have up to two roots). But how high can it go? Let's think.If two of the quadratics have two real roots each, that's four real roots total. The third quadratic would have no real roots. Is that possible?Let me try to find specific values of ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) where two quadratics have two real roots each, and the third doesn't.Let's pick ( a = 1 ), ( b = 5 ), and ( c = 6 ).1. For ( ax^2 + bx + c = x^2 + 5x + 6 ):   - Discriminant ( D_1 = 25 - 24 = 1 ), which is positive. So, it has two real roots: ( x = -2 ) and ( x = -3 ).2. For ( bx^2 + cx + a = 5x^2 + 6x + 1 ):   - Discriminant ( D_2 = 36 - 20 = 16 ), which is positive. So, it has two real roots: ( x = -1 ) and ( x = -frac{1}{5} ).3. For ( cx^2 + ax + b = 6x^2 + x + 5 ):   - Discriminant ( D_3 = 1 - 120 = -119 ), which is negative. So, it has no real roots.So, in this case, we have four real roots in total. That seems to work. Is it possible to have more than four? Let's see. If one quadratic has two real roots and the other two each have one real root, that would be four as well. But wait, quadratics can't have just one real root unless the discriminant is zero, which is a repeated root. So, if two quadratics have two real roots each and the third has none, that's four. If one quadratic has two and the other two have one each, that's also four. So, four seems to be the maximum.Wait, but if all three quadratics have one real root each (i.e., each discriminant is zero), that would be three real roots. But we saw earlier that all three discriminants can't be non-negative, so that's not possible.So, four is the maximum number of real roots possible among the three quadratics.Let me check another example to confirm.Let‚Äôs take ( a = 1 ), ( b = 4 ), ( c = 1 ).1. ( x^2 + 4x + 1 ):   - Discriminant ( D_1 = 16 - 4 = 12 ), which is positive. Roots: ( x = -2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( x = -2 - sqrt{3} ).2. ( 4x^2 + x + 1 ):   - Discriminant ( D_2 = 1 - 16 = -15 ), which is negative. No real roots.3. ( x^2 + x + 4 ):   - Discriminant ( D_3 = 1 - 16 = -15 ), which is negative. No real roots.Wait, that only gives two real roots. So, in this case, only one quadratic has two real roots, and the other two have none. So, total is two. That's less than four. So, my previous example with four real roots is better.Another example: Let‚Äôs take ( a = 1 ), ( b = 3 ), ( c = 2 ).1. ( x^2 + 3x + 2 ):   - Discriminant ( D_1 = 9 - 8 = 1 ), positive. Roots: ( x = -1 ) and ( x = -2 ).2. ( 3x^2 + 2x + 1 ):   - Discriminant ( D_2 = 4 - 12 = -8 ), negative. No real roots.3. ( 2x^2 + x + 3 ):   - Discriminant ( D_3 = 1 - 24 = -23 ), negative. No real roots.Again, only two real roots. Hmm.Wait, maybe I need to choose ( a ), ( b ), ( c ) such that two discriminants are positive and one is negative. Let me try ( a = 1 ), ( b = 5 ), ( c = 6 ) again.1. ( x^2 + 5x + 6 ): Discriminant 1, roots at -2 and -3.2. ( 5x^2 + 6x + 1 ): Discriminant 16, roots at -1 and -1/5.3. ( 6x^2 + x + 5 ): Discriminant -119, no real roots.That's four real roots. So, that works.Another example: Let‚Äôs take ( a = 2 ), ( b = 5 ), ( c = 3 ).1. ( 2x^2 + 5x + 3 ):   - Discriminant ( D_1 = 25 - 24 = 1 ), positive. Roots: ( x = -1 ) and ( x = -1.5 ).2. ( 5x^2 + 3x + 2 ):   - Discriminant ( D_2 = 9 - 40 = -31 ), negative. No real roots.3. ( 3x^2 + 2x + 5 ):   - Discriminant ( D_3 = 4 - 60 = -56 ), negative. No real roots.Again, only two real roots. So, it seems that to get four real roots, we need to carefully choose ( a ), ( b ), ( c ) such that two discriminants are positive and one is negative.Wait, maybe if I take ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = 1 ).1. ( x^2 + 2x + 1 ):   - Discriminant ( D_1 = 4 - 4 = 0 ), repeated root at ( x = -1 ).2. ( 2x^2 + x + 1 ):   - Discriminant ( D_2 = 1 - 8 = -7 ), no real roots.3. ( x^2 + x + 2 ):   - Discriminant ( D_3 = 1 - 8 = -7 ), no real roots.So, only one real root (a repeated one). Not better.Wait, so perhaps four is the maximum, as in the first example.Let me think about whether it's possible to have five real roots. That would mean one quadratic has two real roots, and another has two real roots, and the third has one real root. But wait, quadratics can't have just one real root unless the discriminant is zero, which is a repeated root. So, if one quadratic has a repeated root, that's one real root, and the other two have two each, that would be five. But is that possible?Wait, but earlier, we saw that if all three discriminants are non-negative, it leads to a contradiction. So, if two discriminants are positive and one is zero, does that lead to a contradiction?Let me check.Suppose ( D_1 geq 0 ), ( D_2 geq 0 ), and ( D_3 = 0 ).So:1. ( b^2 geq 4ac )2. ( c^2 geq 4ab )3. ( a^2 = 4bc )From the third equation, ( a^2 = 4bc ). Let's substitute ( a = 2sqrt{bc} ).Now, substitute into the first inequality:( b^2 geq 4ac = 4 * 2sqrt{bc} * c = 8c^{3/2}b^{1/2} )So, ( b^2 geq 8c^{3/2}b^{1/2} )Divide both sides by ( b^{1/2} ) (since ( b > 0 )):( b^{3/2} geq 8c^{3/2} )Take both sides to the power of ( 2/3 ):( b geq 4c )Similarly, substitute into the second inequality:( c^2 geq 4ab = 4 * 2sqrt{bc} * b = 8b^{3/2}c^{1/2} )So, ( c^2 geq 8b^{3/2}c^{1/2} )Divide both sides by ( c^{1/2} ) (since ( c > 0 )):( c^{3/2} geq 8b^{3/2} )Take both sides to the power of ( 2/3 ):( c geq 4b )But from the first substitution, we have ( b geq 4c ), and from the second, ( c geq 4b ). Combining these:( b geq 4c geq 16b )Which implies ( b geq 16b ), which is only possible if ( b = 0 ), but ( b ) is positive. So, contradiction.Therefore, it's impossible for two discriminants to be positive and one to be zero. So, we can't have five real roots.Hence, the maximum number of real roots is four.I think that's the answer. Four real roots is the maximum possible."},{"question":"(The full score of this question is 12 points)  If the domain of the function y = lg(3 - 4x + x^2) is M. When x in M, find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) = 2^{x+2} - 3 times 4^x and the corresponding values of x.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.It says: If the domain of the function ( y = lg(3 - 4x + x^2) ) is ( M ). When ( x in M ), find the maximum and minimum values of ( f(x) = 2^{x+2} - 3 times 4^x ) and the corresponding values of ( x ).Alright, so first, I need to figure out the domain ( M ) of the function ( y = lg(3 - 4x + x^2) ). Since it's a logarithmic function, the argument inside the log must be positive. So, I need to solve the inequality ( 3 - 4x + x^2 > 0 ).Let me write that down:( 3 - 4x + x^2 > 0 )Hmm, this is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, I should first find the roots of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula, ( x = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 12}}{2} = frac{4 pm 2}{2} ). So, the roots are ( x = 3 ) and ( x = 1 ).Since the quadratic opens upwards (the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive), the expression ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ) will be positive outside the interval between the roots. So, the solution to the inequality is ( x < 1 ) or ( x > 3 ). Therefore, the domain ( M ) is ( (-infty, 1) cup (3, infty) ).Okay, so now I know that ( x ) must be less than 1 or greater than 3. Now, I need to find the maximum and minimum values of the function ( f(x) = 2^{x+2} - 3 times 4^x ) on this domain ( M ).Let me write down ( f(x) ) again:( f(x) = 2^{x+2} - 3 times 4^x )Hmm, I notice that both terms involve powers of 2. Maybe I can rewrite this function in terms of a single variable substitution to make it easier to handle. Let me try that.First, ( 2^{x+2} ) can be rewritten as ( 2^x times 2^2 = 4 times 2^x ). Similarly, ( 4^x ) is ( (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} ). So, substituting ( t = 2^x ), we can rewrite ( f(x) ) as:( f(x) = 4t - 3t^2 )So, ( f(x) ) becomes a quadratic function in terms of ( t ):( f(t) = -3t^2 + 4t )Now, since ( t = 2^x ), and ( x ) is in ( M ), which is ( x < 1 ) or ( x > 3 ), I need to find the corresponding range of ( t ).Let me think about that. Since ( t = 2^x ), and ( x ) is a real number, ( t ) must be positive. But more specifically, for ( x < 1 ), ( t = 2^x ) will be less than ( 2^1 = 2 ). For ( x > 3 ), ( t = 2^x ) will be greater than ( 2^3 = 8 ).So, the range of ( t ) is ( 0 < t < 2 ) or ( t > 8 ).Therefore, the function ( f(t) = -3t^2 + 4t ) is defined on two intervals: ( (0, 2) ) and ( (8, infty) ).Now, I need to find the maximum and minimum values of ( f(t) ) on these intervals. Since ( f(t) ) is a quadratic function, it's a parabola opening downward because the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative (-3). So, it has a maximum at its vertex and tends to negative infinity as ( t ) increases.First, let me find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex occurs at ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ). In this case, ( a = -3 ) and ( b = 4 ), so:( t = -frac{4}{2 times (-3)} = -frac{4}{-6} = frac{2}{3} )So, the vertex is at ( t = frac{2}{3} ). Since the parabola opens downward, this is the point where the function reaches its maximum.Now, let's check if ( t = frac{2}{3} ) is within the domain ( (0, 2) cup (8, infty) ). Yes, ( frac{2}{3} ) is approximately 0.666, which is between 0 and 2, so it's within the first interval.Therefore, the maximum value of ( f(t) ) occurs at ( t = frac{2}{3} ). Let me compute ( fleft( frac{2}{3} right) ):( fleft( frac{2}{3} right) = -3 left( frac{2}{3} right)^2 + 4 left( frac{2}{3} right) )Calculating each term:( left( frac{2}{3} right)^2 = frac{4}{9} )So,( -3 times frac{4}{9} = -frac{12}{9} = -frac{4}{3} )And,( 4 times frac{2}{3} = frac{8}{3} )Adding these together:( -frac{4}{3} + frac{8}{3} = frac{4}{3} )So, the maximum value of ( f(t) ) is ( frac{4}{3} ), occurring at ( t = frac{2}{3} ).Now, since ( t = 2^x ), we can find the corresponding ( x ) value:( 2^x = frac{2}{3} )Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:( x = log_2 left( frac{2}{3} right) )Which can also be written as:( x = 1 - log_2 3 )So, the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is ( frac{4}{3} ) at ( x = 1 - log_2 3 ).Now, let's consider the behavior of ( f(t) ) on the intervals ( (0, 2) ) and ( (8, infty) ).First, on ( (0, 2) ):Since the vertex is at ( t = frac{2}{3} ), which is within this interval, and the parabola opens downward, the function increases from ( t = 0 ) to ( t = frac{2}{3} ) and then decreases from ( t = frac{2}{3} ) to ( t = 2 ).Therefore, on ( (0, 2) ), the maximum is at ( t = frac{2}{3} ), which we already found, and the minimum would be at the endpoints.But wait, since ( t ) approaches 0 and 2, let's compute the limits as ( t ) approaches 0 and 2.As ( t ) approaches 0 from the right:( f(t) = -3t^2 + 4t ) approaches ( 0 + 0 = 0 ).As ( t ) approaches 2 from the left:( f(t) = -3(4) + 4(2) = -12 + 8 = -4 ).So, on ( (0, 2) ), the function ranges from just above 0 down to -4.But wait, since ( t ) is in ( (0, 2) ), the function ( f(t) ) goes from 0 (as ( t ) approaches 0) up to ( frac{4}{3} ) at ( t = frac{2}{3} ), and then back down to -4 as ( t ) approaches 2.So, on ( (0, 2) ), the maximum is ( frac{4}{3} ) and the minimum is approaching -4.But since ( t ) doesn't actually reach 2 (it's an open interval), the function doesn't actually attain -4, but gets arbitrarily close to it.Now, on the interval ( (8, infty) ):Here, ( t ) is greater than 8, so let's see how ( f(t) ) behaves as ( t ) increases beyond 8.Since ( f(t) = -3t^2 + 4t ), as ( t ) becomes very large, the ( -3t^2 ) term dominates, so ( f(t) ) tends to negative infinity.Therefore, on ( (8, infty) ), the function ( f(t) ) decreases without bound. So, it doesn't have a minimum value; it just keeps getting smaller and smaller as ( t ) increases.But let's check the value at ( t = 8 ):( f(8) = -3(64) + 4(8) = -192 + 32 = -160 )So, as ( t ) approaches 8 from the right, ( f(t) ) approaches -160, and as ( t ) increases beyond 8, ( f(t) ) becomes less than -160 and continues to decrease.Therefore, on ( (8, infty) ), the function ( f(t) ) has no minimum value because it goes to negative infinity, but it does have a supremum (least upper bound) at -160, but it doesn't actually attain -160 because ( t = 8 ) is not included in the domain ( M ).Wait, hold on. Actually, ( t = 8 ) corresponds to ( x = 3 ), which is not in ( M ) because ( M ) is ( x < 1 ) or ( x > 3 ). So, ( x = 3 ) is excluded, meaning ( t = 8 ) is also excluded. Therefore, ( f(t) ) approaches -160 as ( t ) approaches 8 from the right, but never actually reaches -160.So, putting it all together:- On ( (0, 2) ), ( f(t) ) has a maximum of ( frac{4}{3} ) at ( t = frac{2}{3} ) and approaches -4 as ( t ) approaches 2.- On ( (8, infty) ), ( f(t) ) approaches -160 as ( t ) approaches 8 from the right and tends to negative infinity as ( t ) increases.Therefore, considering the entire domain ( M ), the function ( f(x) ) has a maximum value of ( frac{4}{3} ) at ( x = 1 - log_2 3 ), and it doesn't have a minimum value because it can decrease without bound as ( x ) increases beyond 3.Wait, but the question asks for both maximum and minimum values. So, does that mean there is no minimum? Or is there a minimum on each interval?Hmm, on ( (0, 2) ), the function approaches -4, but doesn't actually reach it. On ( (8, infty) ), it approaches -160 and goes to negative infinity. So, in terms of the entire domain ( M ), the function doesn't have a global minimum because it can get as low as negative infinity. However, on each interval separately, the function has a supremum and infimum, but not necessarily attained.But the question is asking for the maximum and minimum values when ( x in M ). So, perhaps it's expecting the maximum value and noting that there is no minimum because it can decrease indefinitely.Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the maximum and the minimum on each interval, but I think the way it's phrased, it's asking for the maximum and minimum over the entire domain ( M ).So, since the function can go to negative infinity, there is no minimum value. The maximum value is ( frac{4}{3} ), which is attained at ( x = 1 - log_2 3 ).Therefore, the conclusion is that ( f(x) ) has a maximum value of ( frac{4}{3} ) at ( x = 1 - log_2 3 ), and no minimum value because it decreases without bound as ( x ) increases beyond 3.Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Found the domain ( M ) correctly by solving ( x^2 - 4x + 3 > 0 ), resulting in ( x < 1 ) or ( x > 3 ). That seems right.2. Rewrote ( f(x) ) in terms of ( t = 2^x ), leading to ( f(t) = -3t^2 + 4t ). That substitution looks correct.3. Determined the range of ( t ) based on ( x in M ): ( 0 < t < 2 ) or ( t > 8 ). That makes sense because ( 2^x ) is an increasing function.4. Analyzed the quadratic function ( f(t) ) with vertex at ( t = frac{2}{3} ), which is within ( (0, 2) ). Calculated the maximum value at ( t = frac{2}{3} ) as ( frac{4}{3} ). That seems correct.5. Checked the behavior of ( f(t) ) as ( t ) approaches the endpoints of each interval. Found that on ( (0, 2) ), ( f(t) ) approaches 0 and -4, but the maximum is ( frac{4}{3} ). On ( (8, infty) ), ( f(t) ) approaches -160 and goes to negative infinity. So, the function doesn't have a minimum value overall.Yes, that all seems consistent. I think my reasoning is solid here.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is (boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}) at ( x = 1 - log_2 3 ), and there is no minimum value.boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}"},{"question":"Let f(x)= | x^2 - 2x - 3|, determine the number of solutions to the equation f^3 (x) - 4 f^2(x) - f(x) + 4 = 0.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the number of solutions to the equation ( f^3(x) - 4f^2(x) - f(x) + 4 = 0 ), where ( f(x) = |x^2 - 2x - 3| ). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that ( f(x) ) is an absolute value function, which means it's always non-negative. The expression inside the absolute value is a quadratic: ( x^2 - 2x - 3 ). I think I should start by analyzing this quadratic because understanding its behavior will help me understand ( f(x) ).Let me find the roots of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 ). To do that, I can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first. I need two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to -2. Hmm, 1 and -3? Yes, that works because ( (x - 3)(x + 1) = x^2 - 2x - 3 ). So, the roots are ( x = 3 ) and ( x = -1 ).This means the quadratic ( x^2 - 2x - 3 ) crosses the x-axis at ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 3 ). Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the quadratic is negative between ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 3 ) and positive outside this interval.Now, since ( f(x) = |x^2 - 2x - 3| ), it will reflect the negative part of the quadratic to make it positive. So, ( f(x) ) can be written as a piecewise function:[f(x) = begin{cases}x^2 - 2x - 3, & text{if } x leq -1 text{ or } x geq 3, -(x^2 - 2x - 3), & text{if } -1 < x < 3.end{cases}]Simplifying the middle part:[f(x) = begin{cases}x^2 - 2x - 3, & text{if } x leq -1 text{ or } x geq 3, -x^2 + 2x + 3, & text{if } -1 < x < 3.end{cases}]Okay, so now I have a clear picture of ( f(x) ). It's a V-shaped graph with vertices at ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 3 ), and it's symmetric in a way because of the absolute value.Now, the equation I need to solve is ( f^3(x) - 4f^2(x) - f(x) + 4 = 0 ). That looks like a cubic equation in terms of ( f(x) ). Maybe I can factor it to make it easier to solve.Let me set ( y = f(x) ) for simplicity. Then the equation becomes:[y^3 - 4y^2 - y + 4 = 0]I need to factor this cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (4) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1), so possible roots are ( pm1, pm2, pm4 ).Let me test ( y = 1 ):[1 - 4 - 1 + 4 = 0]Yes, that works. So, ( y - 1 ) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.Using synthetic division:1 | 1  -4  -1  4        1  -3  -4      1  -3  -4  0So, the cubic factors as ( (y - 1)(y^2 - 3y - 4) ). Now, let's factor the quadratic:( y^2 - 3y - 4 ). Looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -3. Those numbers are -4 and 1.So, ( y^2 - 3y - 4 = (y - 4)(y + 1) ).Therefore, the full factorization is:[(y - 1)(y - 4)(y + 1) = 0]So, the solutions are ( y = 1 ), ( y = 4 ), and ( y = -1 ).But wait, ( y = f(x) ), and ( f(x) ) is an absolute value, which is always non-negative. So, ( y = -1 ) is not possible because ( f(x) geq 0 ). Therefore, the only valid solutions are ( y = 1 ) and ( y = 4 ).So, now I need to solve ( f(x) = 1 ) and ( f(x) = 4 ) separately and count the number of solutions for each.Let's start with ( f(x) = 1 ).Case 1: ( f(x) = 1 )Since ( f(x) ) is defined piecewise, I need to solve this equation in each interval.First interval: ( x leq -1 ) or ( x geq 3 ). Here, ( f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 3 ). So,[x^2 - 2x - 3 = 1 x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0]Let me solve this quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = frac{2 pm sqrt{20}}{2} = frac{2 pm 2sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 pm sqrt{5}]So, the solutions are ( x = 1 + sqrt{5} ) and ( x = 1 - sqrt{5} ).Now, I need to check if these solutions lie in the intervals ( x leq -1 ) or ( x geq 3 ).Calculate ( 1 + sqrt{5} approx 1 + 2.236 = 3.236 ), which is greater than 3, so it lies in ( x geq 3 ).Calculate ( 1 - sqrt{5} approx 1 - 2.236 = -1.236 ), which is less than -1, so it lies in ( x leq -1 ).Therefore, both solutions are valid in their respective intervals.Next interval: ( -1 < x < 3 ). Here, ( f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 3 ). So,[-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 1 -x^2 + 2x + 2 = 0 x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0]Again, using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 8}}{2} = frac{2 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = frac{2 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 pm sqrt{3}]So, the solutions are ( x = 1 + sqrt{3} ) and ( x = 1 - sqrt{3} ).Check if these lie in ( -1 < x < 3 ).Calculate ( 1 + sqrt{3} approx 1 + 1.732 = 2.732 ), which is less than 3, so it's valid.Calculate ( 1 - sqrt{3} approx 1 - 1.732 = -0.732 ), which is greater than -1, so it's valid.Therefore, both solutions are valid in this interval.So, for ( f(x) = 1 ), we have four solutions: ( x = 1 + sqrt{5} ), ( x = 1 - sqrt{5} ), ( x = 1 + sqrt{3} ), and ( x = 1 - sqrt{3} ).Case 2: ( f(x) = 4 )Again, solving in each interval.First interval: ( x leq -1 ) or ( x geq 3 ). Here, ( f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 3 ). So,[x^2 - 2x - 3 = 4 x^2 - 2x - 7 = 0]Using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 28}}{2} = frac{2 pm sqrt{32}}{2} = frac{2 pm 4sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 pm 2sqrt{2}]So, the solutions are ( x = 1 + 2sqrt{2} ) and ( x = 1 - 2sqrt{2} ).Check if these lie in ( x leq -1 ) or ( x geq 3 ).Calculate ( 1 + 2sqrt{2} approx 1 + 2.828 = 3.828 ), which is greater than 3, so valid.Calculate ( 1 - 2sqrt{2} approx 1 - 2.828 = -1.828 ), which is less than -1, so valid.Therefore, both solutions are valid.Next interval: ( -1 < x < 3 ). Here, ( f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 3 ). So,[-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 4 -x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0]This factors as ( (x - 1)^2 = 0 ), so the solution is ( x = 1 ).Check if this lies in ( -1 < x < 3 ). Yes, ( x = 1 ) is within this interval.Therefore, for ( f(x) = 4 ), we have three solutions: ( x = 1 + 2sqrt{2} ), ( x = 1 - 2sqrt{2} ), and ( x = 1 ).Wait, hold on. When I solved ( f(x) = 4 ) in the middle interval, I got a repeated root at ( x = 1 ). So, does this count as one solution or two? Since it's a double root, but in the context of the original equation, it's still just one distinct solution. So, I think it counts as one solution.Therefore, for ( f(x) = 4 ), we have three solutions: two from the outer intervals and one from the middle interval.Now, combining the solutions from both cases:- From ( f(x) = 1 ): 4 solutions.- From ( f(x) = 4 ): 3 solutions.Total solutions: 4 + 3 = 7.Wait, but I need to make sure there are no overlapping solutions between the two cases. Let me check if any of the solutions for ( f(x) = 1 ) are the same as those for ( f(x) = 4 ).Looking at the solutions:For ( f(x) = 1 ):- ( x = 1 + sqrt{5} approx 3.236 )- ( x = 1 - sqrt{5} approx -1.236 )- ( x = 1 + sqrt{3} approx 2.732 )- ( x = 1 - sqrt{3} approx -0.732 )For ( f(x) = 4 ):- ( x = 1 + 2sqrt{2} approx 3.828 )- ( x = 1 - 2sqrt{2} approx -1.828 )- ( x = 1 )None of these solutions are the same, so there's no overlap. Therefore, the total number of distinct solutions is indeed 7.Just to double-check, let me recap:- ( f(x) = 1 ) gives 4 solutions.- ( f(x) = 4 ) gives 3 solutions.- No overlaps.So, total solutions: 7.I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me visualize the graph of ( f(x) ) and see how it intersects with ( y = 1 ) and ( y = 4 ).The graph of ( f(x) ) is a V-shaped graph with vertices at ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 3 ). Between ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 3 ), it's a downward-opening parabola, and outside this interval, it's an upward-opening parabola.When I draw ( y = 1 ) and ( y = 4 ) on this graph, I should see how many times each horizontal line intersects the graph of ( f(x) ).For ( y = 1 ):- It intersects the left arm (x ‚â§ -1) once.- It intersects the right arm (x ‚â• 3) once.- It intersects the middle downward-opening parabola twice.So, total 4 intersections.For ( y = 4 ):- It intersects the left arm (x ‚â§ -1) once.- It intersects the right arm (x ‚â• 3) once.- It intersects the middle downward-opening parabola once (at the vertex).So, total 3 intersections.Adding them up, 4 + 3 = 7 intersections, which correspond to 7 solutions.Therefore, I'm confident that the number of solutions is 7.**Final Answer**The number of solutions is boxed{7}."},{"question":"Compute the area of the region enclosed by the curves y = |x - 4| and y = 5 - |x - 2| in the xy-plane.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the area of the region enclosed by the curves y = |x - 4| and y = 5 - |x - 2|. Hmm, I remember that absolute value functions create V-shaped graphs, so these are probably two V-shaped lines that intersect somewhere. The area between them would be the region where one is above the other, right? First, I should probably sketch these two functions to visualize where they intersect and what the enclosed region looks like. Let me think about how each function behaves.Starting with y = |x - 4|. The absolute value function |x - a| has its vertex at (a, 0). So, for y = |x - 4|, the vertex is at (4, 0). It opens upwards because the coefficient is positive. So, it's a V-shape with the point at (4, 0).Now, the other function is y = 5 - |x - 2|. This is a bit trickier. The |x - 2| part is another V-shape, but the negative sign in front flips it upside down, and then we add 5, which shifts it up. So, the vertex of this upside-down V is at (2, 5). It opens downward because of the negative sign.So, one V is opening upwards from (4, 0), and the other is opening downwards from (2, 5). They must intersect at some points, and the area between them is the region we need to find.To find the points of intersection, I need to set the two equations equal to each other:|x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|This equation will give me the x-values where the two graphs intersect. Solving this will help me determine the limits of integration if I need to use calculus, or just the boundaries of the region.Let me solve |x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|.Absolute value equations can be tricky because they involve multiple cases. I need to consider different cases based on the value of x.First, let's consider the definition of absolute value. For any expression |A|, it equals A if A is non-negative and -A if A is negative.So, for |x - 4|, the expression inside is x - 4. This is non-negative when x >= 4 and negative when x < 4.Similarly, for |x - 2|, the expression inside is x - 2. This is non-negative when x >= 2 and negative when x < 2.So, I need to break down the problem into intervals based on these critical points: x = 2 and x = 4.Therefore, I can consider three intervals:1. x < 22. 2 <= x < 43. x >= 4I'll solve the equation |x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2| in each interval.**Case 1: x < 2**In this interval, x - 4 is negative (since x < 2 < 4), so |x - 4| = -(x - 4) = -x + 4.Similarly, x - 2 is negative (since x < 2), so |x - 2| = -(x - 2) = -x + 2.Substituting into the equation:|x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|- x + 4 = 5 - (-x + 2)Simplify the right side:5 - (-x + 2) = 5 + x - 2 = x + 3So, the equation becomes:- x + 4 = x + 3Let's solve for x:- x + 4 = x + 3Bring x to the left and constants to the right:- x - x = 3 - 4-2x = -1Divide both sides by -2:x = (-1)/(-2) = 1/2Now, check if this solution is within the interval x < 2. Yes, 1/2 is less than 2, so this is a valid solution.**Case 2: 2 <= x < 4**In this interval, x - 4 is still negative (since x < 4), so |x - 4| = -x + 4.But x - 2 is non-negative (since x >= 2), so |x - 2| = x - 2.Substituting into the equation:|x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|- x + 4 = 5 - (x - 2)Simplify the right side:5 - (x - 2) = 5 - x + 2 = 7 - xSo, the equation becomes:- x + 4 = 7 - xLet's solve for x:- x + 4 = 7 - xAdd x to both sides:4 = 7Wait, that can't be right. 4 = 7 is a contradiction. That means there's no solution in this interval.Hmm, that's interesting. So, between x = 2 and x = 4, the two functions don't intersect. That must mean that one function is entirely above the other in this interval, or maybe they don't cross here.But wait, let me double-check my calculations.Starting again:|x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|In this interval, |x - 4| = -x + 4, and |x - 2| = x - 2.So, substituting:- x + 4 = 5 - (x - 2)Right side: 5 - x + 2 = 7 - xSo, equation: -x + 4 = 7 - xAdding x to both sides: 4 = 7Yes, that's correct. So, no solution in this interval. So, the functions don't intersect here.**Case 3: x >= 4**In this interval, x - 4 is non-negative, so |x - 4| = x - 4.Similarly, x - 2 is non-negative (since x >= 4 > 2), so |x - 2| = x - 2.Substituting into the equation:|x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|x - 4 = 5 - (x - 2)Simplify the right side:5 - x + 2 = 7 - xSo, the equation becomes:x - 4 = 7 - xLet's solve for x:x - 4 = 7 - xBring x to the left and constants to the right:x + x = 7 + 42x = 11x = 11/2 = 5.5Now, check if this solution is within the interval x >= 4. Yes, 5.5 is greater than 4, so this is a valid solution.So, the two points of intersection are at x = 1/2 and x = 5.5.Wait, hold on. Earlier, in Case 1, I got x = 1/2, which is 0.5, and in Case 3, I got x = 5.5. So, these are the two points where the two functions intersect.Therefore, the region enclosed by these two curves is between x = 0.5 and x = 5.5.Now, to find the area between these two curves, I can set up an integral of the top function minus the bottom function from x = 0.5 to x = 5.5.But before setting up the integral, I need to determine which function is on top and which is on the bottom in this interval.Let me pick a test point between 0.5 and 5.5, say x = 3.Compute y1 = |3 - 4| = | -1 | = 1Compute y2 = 5 - |3 - 2| = 5 - |1| = 5 - 1 = 4So, at x = 3, y2 = 4 is above y1 = 1. Therefore, in this interval, y = 5 - |x - 2| is above y = |x - 4|.Therefore, the area A is the integral from x = 0.5 to x = 5.5 of [5 - |x - 2| - |x - 4|] dx.But integrating absolute value functions can be a bit tricky because of the piecewise nature. So, perhaps it's better to break the integral into intervals where the expressions inside the absolute values change their sign.Looking back at the critical points, we have x = 2 and x = 4.So, in the interval from x = 0.5 to x = 5.5, the critical points are at x = 2 and x = 4. Therefore, I can break the integral into three parts:1. From x = 0.5 to x = 22. From x = 2 to x = 43. From x = 4 to x = 5.5In each of these intervals, the expressions inside the absolute values will have consistent signs, so I can remove the absolute value signs accordingly.Let me handle each interval one by one.**Interval 1: x from 0.5 to 2**In this interval, x - 2 is negative (since x < 2), so |x - 2| = -(x - 2) = -x + 2.Similarly, x - 4 is negative (since x < 4), so |x - 4| = -(x - 4) = -x + 4.Therefore, the integrand becomes:5 - |x - 2| - |x - 4| = 5 - (-x + 2) - (-x + 4) = 5 + x - 2 + x - 4 = 5 - 2 - 4 + x + x = (-1) + 2xSo, the integrand simplifies to 2x - 1.Therefore, the integral from 0.5 to 2 is ‚à´(2x - 1) dx.**Interval 2: x from 2 to 4**In this interval, x - 2 is non-negative (since x >= 2), so |x - 2| = x - 2.But x - 4 is still negative (since x < 4), so |x - 4| = -(x - 4) = -x + 4.Therefore, the integrand becomes:5 - |x - 2| - |x - 4| = 5 - (x - 2) - (-x + 4) = 5 - x + 2 + x - 4 = 5 + 2 - 4 - x + x = 3.So, the integrand simplifies to 3, a constant.Therefore, the integral from 2 to 4 is ‚à´3 dx.**Interval 3: x from 4 to 5.5**In this interval, x - 2 is positive (since x >= 4 > 2), so |x - 2| = x - 2.Similarly, x - 4 is non-negative (since x >= 4), so |x - 4| = x - 4.Therefore, the integrand becomes:5 - |x - 2| - |x - 4| = 5 - (x - 2) - (x - 4) = 5 - x + 2 - x + 4 = 5 + 2 + 4 - x - x = 11 - 2x.So, the integrand simplifies to 11 - 2x.Therefore, the integral from 4 to 5.5 is ‚à´(11 - 2x) dx.Now, let's compute each integral separately.**Integral 1: From 0.5 to 2 of (2x - 1) dx**First, find the antiderivative:‚à´(2x - 1) dx = x¬≤ - x + CEvaluate from 0.5 to 2:At x = 2: (2)¬≤ - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2At x = 0.5: (0.5)¬≤ - 0.5 = 0.25 - 0.5 = -0.25Subtracting: 2 - (-0.25) = 2 + 0.25 = 2.25So, the first integral is 2.25.**Integral 2: From 2 to 4 of 3 dx**Antiderivative is 3x + CEvaluate from 2 to 4:At x = 4: 3*4 = 12At x = 2: 3*2 = 6Subtracting: 12 - 6 = 6So, the second integral is 6.**Integral 3: From 4 to 5.5 of (11 - 2x) dx**Antiderivative:‚à´(11 - 2x) dx = 11x - x¬≤ + CEvaluate from 4 to 5.5:At x = 5.5: 11*5.5 - (5.5)¬≤Compute 11*5.5: 11*5 = 55, 11*0.5 = 5.5, so total 55 + 5.5 = 60.5Compute (5.5)¬≤: 5.5*5.5. Let's compute 5*5 = 25, 5*0.5 = 2.5, 0.5*5 = 2.5, 0.5*0.5 = 0.25. So, adding up: 25 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 0.25 = 30.25So, 11x - x¬≤ at x = 5.5 is 60.5 - 30.25 = 30.25At x = 4: 11*4 - (4)¬≤ = 44 - 16 = 28Subtracting: 30.25 - 28 = 2.25So, the third integral is 2.25.Now, summing up all three integrals:First integral: 2.25Second integral: 6Third integral: 2.25Total area A = 2.25 + 6 + 2.25 = 10.5Wait, 2.25 + 6 is 8.25, plus 2.25 is 10.5. So, the area is 10.5 square units.But wait, 10.5 is equal to 21/2. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere because when I initially thought about the problem, I thought it might be a trapezoid or something with a simpler area.Let me double-check my calculations.First integral: from 0.5 to 2, function is 2x - 1.Antiderivative: x¬≤ - xAt 2: 4 - 2 = 2At 0.5: 0.25 - 0.5 = -0.25Difference: 2 - (-0.25) = 2.25. That seems correct.Second integral: from 2 to 4, function is 3.Integral is 3x from 2 to 4: 12 - 6 = 6. Correct.Third integral: from 4 to 5.5, function is 11 - 2x.Antiderivative: 11x - x¬≤At 5.5: 60.5 - 30.25 = 30.25At 4: 44 - 16 = 28Difference: 30.25 - 28 = 2.25. Correct.So, total area is indeed 2.25 + 6 + 2.25 = 10.5.But 10.5 is 21/2, which is 10.5. Hmm.Wait, but let me think about the geometry of the situation. The two V-shaped graphs intersect at x = 0.5 and x = 5.5, and between x = 2 and x = 4, the upper function is constant at y = 3.So, the figure is a polygon with vertices at (0.5, 3), (2, 5), (4, 1), and (5.5, 3). Wait, is that correct?Wait, actually, let me plot the points:At x = 0.5, both functions equal 3.At x = 2, y = 5 - |2 - 2| = 5, and y = |2 - 4| = 2. So, the upper function is 5, lower is 2.At x = 4, y = |4 - 4| = 0, and y = 5 - |4 - 2| = 5 - 2 = 3.At x = 5.5, both functions equal 3.Wait, so actually, the enclosed region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0.5, 3), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 3). Wait, but at x = 4, y = 0 for one function and y = 3 for the other. So, actually, the points are (0.5, 3), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 3). Hmm, but at x = 4, the lower function is y = 0, but the upper function is y = 3. So, actually, the region is bounded by (0.5, 3), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 3). So, it's a trapezoid.Wait, a trapezoid has two sides parallel. Let me see.From (0.5, 3) to (2, 5): that's a line.From (2, 5) to (4, 3): another line.From (4, 3) to (5.5, 3): a horizontal line.From (5.5, 3) back to (0.5, 3): another horizontal line.Wait, so actually, the figure is a trapezoid with two parallel sides at y = 3, from x = 0.5 to x = 5.5, and the other two sides are the lines connecting (0.5, 3) to (2, 5) and (4, 3) to (5.5, 3). Wait, no, actually, the sides are from (0.5, 3) to (2, 5), then from (2, 5) to (4, 3), and then from (4, 3) to (5.5, 3). So, it's more like a kite-shaped figure or a quadrilateral.But regardless, the area can be calculated as the sum of two triangles and a rectangle or something like that.But since I already calculated the area via integration as 10.5, which is 21/2, and that seems consistent.Wait, but 10.5 is equal to 21/2, which is 10.5. So, perhaps that's the correct answer.But let me think again. The region is bounded between x = 0.5 and x = 5.5, with the top function being y = 5 - |x - 2| and the bottom function being y = |x - 4|.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area by finding the coordinates of the vertices and using the shoelace formula.Let's try that.The vertices of the enclosed region are:1. Intersection point at (0.5, 3)2. The peak of the upper function at (2, 5)3. The other intersection point at (5.5, 3)4. The point where the lower function meets the upper function at (4, 3). Wait, no, at x = 4, y = |4 - 4| = 0, but the upper function is y = 5 - |4 - 2| = 3. So, actually, the region is bounded by (0.5, 3), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 3). So, four points.Wait, but at x = 4, the lower function is y = 0, but the upper function is y = 3. So, actually, the region is bounded by (0.5, 3), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 3). So, it's a quadrilateral.Let me list the coordinates:A: (0.5, 3)B: (2, 5)C: (4, 3)D: (5.5, 3)So, quadrilateral ABCD.To compute the area using the shoelace formula, I can list the coordinates in order and apply the formula.Shoelace formula:Area = 1/2 |sum over i (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|Where the vertices are listed in order, and the last vertex connects back to the first.So, let's list the coordinates in order: A(0.5, 3), B(2, 5), C(4, 3), D(5.5, 3), and back to A(0.5, 3).Compute the sum:Term 1: x_A y_B - x_B y_A = 0.5*5 - 2*3 = 2.5 - 6 = -3.5Term 2: x_B y_C - x_C y_B = 2*3 - 4*5 = 6 - 20 = -14Term 3: x_C y_D - x_D y_C = 4*3 - 5.5*3 = 12 - 16.5 = -4.5Term 4: x_D y_A - x_A y_D = 5.5*3 - 0.5*3 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15Now, sum all terms:-3.5 + (-14) + (-4.5) + 15 = (-3.5 -14 -4.5) +15 = (-22) +15 = -7Take absolute value: | -7 | = 7Multiply by 1/2: 1/2 *7 = 3.5Wait, that's only 3.5, which is 7/2. But earlier, the integral gave me 10.5, which is 21/2. There's a discrepancy here. So, I must have made a mistake in applying the shoelace formula.Wait, let me double-check the shoelace formula.I think I might have missed a term or misapplied the coordinates.Wait, the shoelace formula requires the coordinates to be listed in order, either clockwise or counterclockwise, without crossing.Let me list them again:A: (0.5, 3)B: (2, 5)C: (4, 3)D: (5.5, 3)Back to A: (0.5, 3)So, the order is A -> B -> C -> D -> A.Compute each term:Term 1: x_A y_B - x_B y_A = 0.5*5 - 2*3 = 2.5 - 6 = -3.5Term 2: x_B y_C - x_C y_B = 2*3 - 4*5 = 6 - 20 = -14Term 3: x_C y_D - x_D y_C = 4*3 - 5.5*3 = 12 - 16.5 = -4.5Term 4: x_D y_A - x_A y_D = 5.5*3 - 0.5*3 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15Sum: -3.5 -14 -4.5 +15 = (-22) +15 = -7Absolute value: 7Area: 1/2 *7 = 3.5Hmm, that's conflicting with the integral result of 10.5.Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula isn't applicable here because the quadrilateral is not convex or because I missed some points.Wait, actually, looking back, the region is bounded by four points: (0.5, 3), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 3). But when I connect these points, the figure is a trapezoid with two sides at y = 3 and the other two sides connecting (0.5, 3) to (2, 5) and (4, 3) to (5.5, 3). Wait, no, actually, from (4, 3) to (5.5, 3) is a straight line, and from (0.5, 3) to (2, 5) is another line.But perhaps the shoelace formula is not the best approach here because the figure is not a simple polygon without crossing lines.Alternatively, maybe I should divide the area into two triangles and a rectangle or something.Wait, let's think differently. The area between the two curves from x = 0.5 to x = 5.5 can be split into two regions: from x = 0.5 to x = 2, the upper function is 5 - |x - 2| and the lower function is |x - 4|. Then, from x = 2 to x = 4, the upper function is still 5 - |x - 2|, but the lower function is |x - 4|. Wait, but earlier, in the integral, I found that in x = 2 to x = 4, the integrand was a constant 3, which suggests that the area is a rectangle.Wait, but when I computed the integral, I got 6 for that part, which is 3*(4 - 2) = 6, which makes sense.Similarly, from x = 0.5 to x = 2, the area is a triangle with base 1.5 (from 0.5 to 2) and height increasing from 3 to 5.Wait, actually, maybe I can compute the area geometrically.From x = 0.5 to x = 2, the upper function is a line from (0.5, 3) to (2, 5), and the lower function is a line from (0.5, 3) to (4, 0). Wait, no, the lower function is |x - 4|, which at x = 0.5 is |0.5 - 4| = 3.5, but wait, no, earlier we found that at x = 0.5, both functions equal 3. Wait, that's conflicting.Wait, hold on. At x = 0.5, y = |0.5 - 4| = 3.5, but earlier, we found that the intersection point is at (0.5, 3). Wait, that can't be.Wait, no, let me recast.Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. When solving for the intersection points, I set |x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|.At x = 0.5, |0.5 - 4| = 3.5, and 5 - |0.5 - 2| = 5 - 1.5 = 3.5. So, both functions equal 3.5 at x = 0.5, not 3.Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.Wait, let me recast.Wait, in the initial solving, I had:Case 1: x < 2|x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|Which led to x = 0.5.But at x = 0.5, |0.5 - 4| = 3.5, and 5 - |0.5 - 2| = 5 - 1.5 = 3.5. So, both functions equal 3.5, not 3.Similarly, in Case 3, x = 5.5, |5.5 - 4| = 1.5, and 5 - |5.5 - 2| = 5 - 3.5 = 1.5. So, both functions equal 1.5, not 3.Wait, so my earlier conclusion that the intersection points are at (0.5, 3) and (5.5, 3) is wrong. They are actually at (0.5, 3.5) and (5.5, 1.5).Wait, that changes everything.Wait, let me recast the problem.When I solved |x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|, I got x = 0.5 and x = 5.5.At x = 0.5, y = |0.5 - 4| = 3.5, and y = 5 - |0.5 - 2| = 5 - 1.5 = 3.5.At x = 5.5, y = |5.5 - 4| = 1.5, and y = 5 - |5.5 - 2| = 5 - 3.5 = 1.5.So, the intersection points are at (0.5, 3.5) and (5.5, 1.5).Wait, that makes more sense.So, the region enclosed by the two curves is between x = 0.5 and x = 5.5, with the upper function being y = 5 - |x - 2| and the lower function being y = |x - 4|.But wait, at x = 2, y = 5 - |2 - 2| = 5, and y = |2 - 4| = 2. So, the upper function is 5, lower is 2.At x = 4, y = |4 - 4| = 0, and y = 5 - |4 - 2| = 3. So, upper function is 3, lower is 0.So, the region is bounded by the two intersection points (0.5, 3.5) and (5.5, 1.5), and the two functions cross each other in between.Wait, but earlier, when I solved the equation, I found that in the interval x = 2 to x = 4, the equation had no solution, meaning the functions don't intersect there, but one is entirely above the other.Wait, let me re-examine the solving of the equation.Original equation: |x - 4| = 5 - |x - 2|Case 1: x < 2Solution: x = 0.5, which is valid.Case 2: 2 <= x < 4Equation led to 4 = 7, which is a contradiction, so no solution.Case 3: x >= 4Solution: x = 5.5, which is valid.Therefore, the only intersection points are at x = 0.5 and x = 5.5.Therefore, the region enclosed is between x = 0.5 and x = 5.5, with the upper function being y = 5 - |x - 2| and the lower function being y = |x - 4|.Therefore, the area is the integral from x = 0.5 to x = 5.5 of [5 - |x - 2| - |x - 4|] dx.But since the functions are piecewise linear, I can break the integral into intervals where the expressions inside the absolute values change their sign, which are at x = 2 and x = 4.So, the integral becomes:Integral from 0.5 to 2 of [5 - (2 - x) - (4 - x)] dxPlusIntegral from 2 to 4 of [5 - (x - 2) - (4 - x)] dxPlusIntegral from 4 to 5.5 of [5 - (x - 2) - (x - 4)] dxWait, let me re-express the integrand in each interval.**Interval 1: 0.5 <= x < 2**In this interval, |x - 2| = 2 - x and |x - 4| = 4 - x.So, integrand: 5 - (2 - x) - (4 - x) = 5 - 2 + x - 4 + x = (5 - 2 - 4) + (x + x) = (-1) + 2xSo, integrand is 2x - 1.**Interval 2: 2 <= x < 4**In this interval, |x - 2| = x - 2 and |x - 4| = 4 - x.So, integrand: 5 - (x - 2) - (4 - x) = 5 - x + 2 - 4 + x = (5 + 2 - 4) + (-x + x) = 3 + 0 = 3So, integrand is 3.**Interval 3: 4 <= x <= 5.5**In this interval, |x - 2| = x - 2 and |x - 4| = x - 4.So, integrand: 5 - (x - 2) - (x - 4) = 5 - x + 2 - x + 4 = (5 + 2 + 4) + (-x - x) = 11 - 2xSo, integrand is 11 - 2x.Therefore, the area A is:A = ‚à´ from 0.5 to 2 of (2x - 1) dx + ‚à´ from 2 to 4 of 3 dx + ‚à´ from 4 to 5.5 of (11 - 2x) dxNow, compute each integral.**First Integral: ‚à´ from 0.5 to 2 of (2x - 1) dx**Antiderivative: x¬≤ - xEvaluate at 2: (2)¬≤ - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2Evaluate at 0.5: (0.5)¬≤ - 0.5 = 0.25 - 0.5 = -0.25Difference: 2 - (-0.25) = 2.25**Second Integral: ‚à´ from 2 to 4 of 3 dx**Antiderivative: 3xEvaluate at 4: 12Evaluate at 2: 6Difference: 12 - 6 = 6**Third Integral: ‚à´ from 4 to 5.5 of (11 - 2x) dx**Antiderivative: 11x - x¬≤Evaluate at 5.5: 11*5.5 - (5.5)¬≤ = 60.5 - 30.25 = 30.25Evaluate at 4: 11*4 - 4¬≤ = 44 - 16 = 28Difference: 30.25 - 28 = 2.25Now, sum all three integrals:2.25 + 6 + 2.25 = 10.5So, the area is 10.5 square units, which is 21/2.But earlier, when I tried the shoelace formula, I got 3.5, which was incorrect because I had the wrong intersection points. Now, with the correct intersection points at (0.5, 3.5) and (5.5, 1.5), let's try the shoelace formula again.List the vertices in order:A: (0.5, 3.5)B: (2, 5)C: (4, 3)D: (5.5, 1.5)Back to A: (0.5, 3.5)Compute the shoelace sum:Term 1: x_A y_B - x_B y_A = 0.5*5 - 2*3.5 = 2.5 - 7 = -4.5Term 2: x_B y_C - x_C y_B = 2*3 - 4*5 = 6 - 20 = -14Term 3: x_C y_D - x_D y_C = 4*1.5 - 5.5*3 = 6 - 16.5 = -10.5Term 4: x_D y_A - x_A y_D = 5.5*3.5 - 0.5*1.5 = 19.25 - 0.75 = 18.5Sum all terms:-4.5 -14 -10.5 +18.5 = (-29) +18.5 = -10.5Take absolute value: 10.5Multiply by 1/2: 1/2 *10.5 = 5.25Wait, that's 5.25, which is 21/4, not 10.5. Hmm, that's still not matching.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the shoelace formula again. Let me recast.Wait, the shoelace formula should be:Area = 1/2 |sum over i (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|So, let's compute each term step by step.List of points in order:A: (0.5, 3.5)B: (2, 5)C: (4, 3)D: (5.5, 1.5)Back to A: (0.5, 3.5)Compute each term:Term 1: x_A y_B - x_B y_A = 0.5*5 - 2*3.5 = 2.5 - 7 = -4.5Term 2: x_B y_C - x_C y_B = 2*3 - 4*5 = 6 - 20 = -14Term 3: x_C y_D - x_D y_C = 4*1.5 - 5.5*3 = 6 - 16.5 = -10.5Term 4: x_D y_A - x_A y_D = 5.5*3.5 - 0.5*1.5 = 19.25 - 0.75 = 18.5Sum of terms: -4.5 -14 -10.5 +18.5 = (-29) +18.5 = -10.5Absolute value: 10.5Area: 1/2 *10.5 = 5.25Wait, that's still 5.25, which is half of the integral result. So, why is there a discrepancy?Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula is not applicable here because the polygon is not convex or because the points are not ordered correctly.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the entire polygon, including the lower parts.Wait, actually, the region enclosed by the two curves is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0.5, 3.5), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 1.5). But when I apply the shoelace formula, I get 5.25, which is half of the integral result. That suggests that I might have missed considering the lower part of the region.Wait, no, the shoelace formula should account for the entire enclosed area. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the points.Wait, let me try listing the points in a different order.Let me list them as A(0.5, 3.5), B(2, 5), C(4, 3), D(5.5, 1.5), and back to A.Wait, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe I should list them in a different sequence.Alternatively, perhaps the region is not a simple quadrilateral but has more vertices.Wait, actually, the region is bounded by four points: (0.5, 3.5), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 1.5). So, it's a quadrilateral, but when I apply the shoelace formula, I get 5.25, which is half of the integral result. That suggests that the shoelace formula is not the right approach here, or I'm misapplying it.Alternatively, perhaps the region is symmetric, and I can compute the area by considering triangles and rectangles.Wait, let's think about the shape. From x = 0.5 to x = 2, the upper function is increasing from 3.5 to 5, and the lower function is decreasing from 3.5 to 2. So, the area between them is a trapezoid.From x = 2 to x = 4, the upper function is decreasing from 5 to 3, and the lower function is decreasing from 2 to 0. So, the area is another trapezoid.From x = 4 to x = 5.5, the upper function is decreasing from 3 to 1.5, and the lower function is increasing from 0 to 1.5. So, the area is another trapezoid.Wait, but actually, in each interval, the area is a trapezoid or a triangle.Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to stick with the integral result, which is 10.5.But let me think again. The integral from 0.5 to 5.5 of [5 - |x - 2| - |x - 4|] dx is 10.5, which is 21/2.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area geometrically by considering the shapes.From x = 0.5 to x = 2, the upper function is a line from (0.5, 3.5) to (2, 5), and the lower function is a line from (0.5, 3.5) to (4, 0). Wait, no, the lower function is |x - 4|, which at x = 0.5 is 3.5, and at x = 2 is 2.So, the area from x = 0.5 to x = 2 is the area between two lines: one going from (0.5, 3.5) to (2, 5), and the other going from (0.5, 3.5) to (2, 2).So, that's a trapezoid with bases at y = 3.5 and y = 2, and height (difference in x) of 1.5.Area = 1/2*(3.5 + 2)*1.5 = 1/2*5.5*1.5 = 1/2*8.25 = 4.125Similarly, from x = 2 to x = 4, the upper function is a line from (2, 5) to (4, 3), and the lower function is a line from (2, 2) to (4, 0).So, the area is the area between these two lines.The upper function is a line from (2, 5) to (4, 3). The lower function is a line from (2, 2) to (4, 0).So, the vertical distance between these two lines at any x is [5 - |x - 2|] - [|x - 4|].But since we already know that in this interval, the integrand is 3, the area is 3*(4 - 2) = 6.From x = 4 to x = 5.5, the upper function is a line from (4, 3) to (5.5, 1.5), and the lower function is a line from (4, 0) to (5.5, 1.5).So, the area is the area between these two lines.The upper function is decreasing from 3 to 1.5, and the lower function is increasing from 0 to 1.5.So, the vertical distance between them is [5 - |x - 2|] - [|x - 4|] = 11 - 2x.Wait, but integrating that from 4 to 5.5 gives 2.25, as before.So, total area is 4.125 + 6 + 2.25 = 12.375, which is 99/8, which is not matching the integral result.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should stick with the integral result of 10.5, which is 21/2.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the geometric approach.Wait, let me think again. The integral result is 10.5, which is 21/2. The shoelace formula gave me 5.25, which is 21/4, exactly half. That suggests that perhaps I missed considering the lower part of the region.Wait, but the region is entirely above the x-axis, so the shoelace formula should account for the entire area.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the points. Let me try listing the points in a different order.Let me list them as A(0.5, 3.5), D(5.5, 1.5), C(4, 3), B(2, 5), and back to A.Compute the shoelace sum:Term 1: x_A y_D - x_D y_A = 0.5*1.5 - 5.5*3.5 = 0.75 - 19.25 = -18.5Term 2: x_D y_C - x_C y_D = 5.5*3 - 4*1.5 = 16.5 - 6 = 10.5Term 3: x_C y_B - x_B y_C = 4*5 - 2*3 = 20 - 6 = 14Term 4: x_B y_A - x_A y_B = 2*3.5 - 0.5*5 = 7 - 2.5 = 4.5Sum all terms:-18.5 +10.5 +14 +4.5 = (-18.5 +10.5) + (14 +4.5) = (-8) +18.5 = 10.5Absolute value: 10.5Area: 1/2 *10.5 = 5.25Still 5.25. So, regardless of the order, I get 5.25, which is half of the integral result.This suggests that the shoelace formula is not the right approach here, or perhaps the region is not a simple polygon.Alternatively, perhaps the region is symmetric, and I can compute the area by considering triangles and rectangles.Wait, let's think about the entire figure.From x = 0.5 to x = 5.5, the upper function is y = 5 - |x - 2|, which is a V-shaped graph peaking at (2, 5). The lower function is y = |x - 4|, which is a V-shaped graph peaking at (4, 0).The region between them is bounded by these two curves, intersecting at (0.5, 3.5) and (5.5, 1.5).So, the area can be considered as the area under the upper function minus the area under the lower function between x = 0.5 and x = 5.5.But that's essentially what the integral represents.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area by considering the two triangles formed by the intersection points and the peaks.Wait, the upper function has a peak at (2, 5), and the lower function has a peak at (4, 0). The intersection points are at (0.5, 3.5) and (5.5, 1.5).So, the region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0.5, 3.5), (2, 5), (4, 0), and (5.5, 1.5). Wait, but earlier, I thought the lower function at x = 4 is y = 0, but the upper function at x = 4 is y = 3.Wait, actually, the region is bounded by the two curves, so the vertices are (0.5, 3.5), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 1.5). Wait, no, at x = 4, the lower function is y = 0, but the upper function is y = 3. So, the region is bounded by (0.5, 3.5), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (5.5, 1.5). So, it's a quadrilateral.Wait, but when I apply the shoelace formula, I get 5.25, which is half of the integral result. So, perhaps the shoelace formula is not applicable here because the polygon is not convex or because the points are not ordered correctly.Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the area as the sum of two triangles and a rectangle.Wait, from x = 0.5 to x = 2, the area is a trapezoid with bases at y = 3.5 and y = 5, and height 1.5.Area = 1/2*(3.5 + 5)*1.5 = 1/2*8.5*1.5 = 1/2*12.75 = 6.375From x = 2 to x = 4, the area is a rectangle with height 3 and width 2.Area = 3*2 = 6From x = 4 to x = 5.5, the area is a trapezoid with bases at y = 3 and y = 1.5, and height 1.5.Area = 1/2*(3 + 1.5)*1.5 = 1/2*4.5*1.5 = 1/2*6.75 = 3.375Total area: 6.375 + 6 + 3.375 = 15.75, which is 63/4, which is still not matching the integral result.Wait, this is getting too confusing. I think the integral result of 10.5 is correct because it's a straightforward application of calculus, breaking the integral into intervals where the functions are linear.Therefore, I will conclude that the area is 10.5 square units, which is 21/2."},{"question":"When 0 < x < frac{pi}{4}, the minimum value of the function f(x)=frac{{cos}^2x}{cos xsin x-{sin}^2x} is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the minimum value of the function ( f(x) = frac{cos^2 x}{cos x sin x - sin^2 x} ) when ( 0 < x < frac{pi}{4} ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with trigonometric functions, sometimes it's helpful to express everything in terms of sine and cosine, or maybe even tangent. Let me see if I can simplify this expression somehow.Looking at the denominator, it's ( cos x sin x - sin^2 x ). Maybe I can factor something out here. Let me factor out a ( sin x ) from both terms:Denominator: ( sin x (cos x - sin x) ).So now, the function becomes:( f(x) = frac{cos^2 x}{sin x (cos x - sin x)} ).Hmm, that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Maybe I can divide both the numerator and the denominator by ( cos^2 x ) to simplify things. Let's try that:Numerator: ( frac{cos^2 x}{cos^2 x} = 1 ).Denominator: ( frac{sin x (cos x - sin x)}{cos^2 x} = frac{sin x}{cos x} - frac{sin^2 x}{cos^2 x} = tan x - tan^2 x ).So, now the function simplifies to:( f(x) = frac{1}{tan x - tan^2 x} ).That looks better! Now, let me denote ( t = tan x ). Since ( 0 < x < frac{pi}{4} ), ( t ) will be between 0 and 1 because ( tan frac{pi}{4} = 1 ).So, substituting ( t ) into the function, we get:( f(t) = frac{1}{t - t^2} ).Now, I need to find the minimum value of ( f(t) ) for ( 0 < t < 1 ). To find the minimum of this function, I can analyze the denominator ( t - t^2 ) because as the denominator gets larger, the overall value of ( f(t) ) gets smaller, and vice versa.So, let me focus on the denominator ( g(t) = t - t^2 ). To find its maximum (since that will correspond to the minimum of ( f(t) )), I can take the derivative and set it to zero.Calculating the derivative:( g'(t) = 1 - 2t ).Setting ( g'(t) = 0 ):( 1 - 2t = 0 )  ( 2t = 1 )  ( t = frac{1}{2} ).So, the maximum of ( g(t) ) occurs at ( t = frac{1}{2} ). Let me compute ( gleft( frac{1}{2} right) ):( gleft( frac{1}{2} right) = frac{1}{2} - left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{4} ).Therefore, the maximum value of the denominator ( g(t) ) is ( frac{1}{4} ), which means the minimum value of ( f(t) ) is:( fleft( frac{1}{2} right) = frac{1}{frac{1}{4}} = 4 ).Wait, let me double-check that. If ( t = frac{1}{2} ), then ( tan x = frac{1}{2} ), which is within the interval ( 0 < x < frac{pi}{4} ) because ( tan frac{pi}{4} = 1 ), so ( frac{1}{2} ) is less than 1. That makes sense.Alternatively, I can complete the square for the quadratic in the denominator to confirm. Let's rewrite ( g(t) = -t^2 + t ):( g(t) = -left( t^2 - t right) ).Completing the square inside the parentheses:( t^2 - t = t^2 - t + frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{4} = left( t - frac{1}{2} right)^2 - frac{1}{4} ).Therefore,( g(t) = -left( left( t - frac{1}{2} right)^2 - frac{1}{4} right) = -left( t - frac{1}{2} right)^2 + frac{1}{4} ).So, the maximum value of ( g(t) ) is indeed ( frac{1}{4} ) when ( t = frac{1}{2} ), which confirms our earlier result.Hence, the minimum value of ( f(x) ) is 4.**Final Answer**The minimum value of the function is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Wilson decides to go sledding on some nearby hills.

How many small hills did he sled down?","answer":"First, calculate the total number of times Wilson sleds down the tall hills. He sleds down each of the 2 tall hills 4 times, so:2 tall hills √ó 4 times each = 8 times.Next, determine the total number of times he sleds down the small hills by subtracting the times on the tall hills from the overall total:14 total sleds - 8 tall hill sleds = 6 small hill sleds.Since Wilson sleds down the small hills half as often as the tall hills, he sleds down each small hill 2 times. Finally, find the number of small hills by dividing the total small hill sleds by the number of sleds per small hill:6 small hill sleds √∑ 2 times per small hill = 3 small hills."},{"question":"Point ( P(4, -5) ) is outside the circle ( x^{2} + y^{2} = 4 ). Let ( PA ) and ( PB ) be the tangents to the circle from point ( P ). What is the equation of the line containing the points of tangency ( A ) and ( B )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a point P at (4, -5) outside a circle defined by the equation x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 4. I need to find the equation of the line that contains the points where the tangents from P touch the circle, which are points A and B. First, I remember that when you have a point outside a circle, you can draw two tangent lines from that point to the circle. The points where these tangents touch the circle are called points of tangency, which in this case are A and B. The line connecting A and B is called the chord of contact or the polar line of point P with respect to the circle.I think the general formula for the chord of contact from an external point (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) to the circle x¬≤ + y¬≤ = r¬≤ is given by xx‚ÇÅ + yy‚ÇÅ = r¬≤. Let me verify that. If I substitute the coordinates of P into this formula, it should give me the equation of the line AB.So, plugging in the values, x‚ÇÅ is 4 and y‚ÇÅ is -5. The radius squared r¬≤ is 4 because the circle equation is x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 4. Therefore, the equation should be x*4 + y*(-5) = 4. Simplifying that, it becomes 4x - 5y = 4.Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is this formula correct? I think so because the chord of contact formula is derived from the condition that the tangent from an external point satisfies. The equation of a tangent to the circle x¬≤ + y¬≤ = r¬≤ at a point (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) is xx‚ÇÅ + yy‚ÇÅ = r¬≤. But in this case, since P is outside, the chord of contact is the set of all points where the tangents from P touch the circle, so it should be the same formula.Let me also think about another approach to confirm. Maybe using the condition for a line to be tangent to a circle. If I assume a general line passing through P(4, -5) with slope m, its equation would be y + 5 = m(x - 4). To find the condition for this line to be tangent to the circle x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 4, the distance from the center of the circle (which is at (0,0)) to the line should be equal to the radius, which is 2.The distance from (0,0) to the line y = m(x - 4) - 5 is |0 - m*0 + (-4m -5)| / sqrt(m¬≤ + 1) = | -4m -5 | / sqrt(m¬≤ + 1). This should equal 2. So, | -4m -5 | / sqrt(m¬≤ + 1) = 2. Squaring both sides, (16m¬≤ + 40m + 25) = 4(m¬≤ + 1). Simplifying, 16m¬≤ + 40m + 25 = 4m¬≤ + 4. So, 12m¬≤ + 40m + 21 = 0.Solving this quadratic equation for m: m = [-40 ¬± sqrt(1600 - 1008)] / 24 = [-40 ¬± sqrt(592)] / 24 = [-40 ¬± 4*sqrt(37)] / 24 = [-10 ¬± sqrt(37)] / 6.So, the slopes of the two tangents are m1 = (-10 + sqrt(37))/6 and m2 = (-10 - sqrt(37))/6. Now, the equations of the two tangents are y + 5 = m1(x - 4) and y + 5 = m2(x - 4). To find the points of tangency A and B, I would need to find where these lines intersect the circle. But that seems complicated. Instead, I recall that the chord of contact can be found using the formula I mentioned earlier, which is 4x - 5y = 4.Alternatively, another way to find the equation of the chord AB is to use the fact that it is the polar of point P with respect to the circle. The polar line of a point (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) with respect to the circle x¬≤ + y¬≤ = r¬≤ is given by xx‚ÇÅ + yy‚ÇÅ = r¬≤, which again gives 4x - 5y = 4.So, both methods lead me to the same equation: 4x - 5y = 4. Therefore, I can be confident that this is the correct equation of the line containing points A and B."},{"question":"Let f(x) be any function defined on mathbb{R}. Which of the following statements is correct?(A) f(x)f(-x) is an odd function.(B) f(x)|f(-x)| is an odd function.(C) f(x)-f(-x) is an even function.(D) f(x)+f(-x) is an even function.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about functions and whether certain combinations of a function and its reflection over the y-axis (which is f(-x)) are odd or even. I need to figure out which of the statements (A) through (D) is correct. Let me start by recalling what odd and even functions are.An even function satisfies the condition f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, I get the same value as when I plug in x. A classic example is f(x) = x¬≤, because (-x)¬≤ = x¬≤.An odd function, on the other hand, satisfies f(-x) = -f(x). This means that flipping the input flips the output. A simple example is f(x) = x¬≥, since (-x)¬≥ = -x¬≥.Now, the problem is about any function f(x) defined on all real numbers, so I can't assume anything specific about f(x). I need to analyze each option one by one.Starting with option (A): f(x)f(-x) is an odd function.Hmm, let me define a new function F(x) = f(x)f(-x). To check if it's odd, I need to see if F(-x) = -F(x). Let's compute F(-x):F(-x) = f(-x)f(-(-x)) = f(-x)f(x) = f(x)f(-x) = F(x)So, F(-x) = F(x), which means F(x) is even, not odd. Therefore, statement (A) is incorrect.Moving on to option (B): f(x)|f(-x)| is an odd function.Again, let me define F(x) = f(x)|f(-x)|. To check if it's odd, I need to compute F(-x):F(-x) = f(-x)|f(-(-x))| = f(-x)|f(x)|Now, for F(x) to be odd, F(-x) should equal -F(x). So, let's see:Is f(-x)|f(x)| equal to -f(x)|f(-x)|?Hmm, that would require f(-x)|f(x)| = -f(x)|f(-x)|. Let's rearrange:f(-x)|f(x)| + f(x)|f(-x)| = 0But unless f(x) is zero, this isn't necessarily true. Since f(x) is any function, I can't guarantee that this equality holds. For example, if f(x) is positive, then |f(x)| = f(x), and |f(-x)| = f(-x) if f(-x) is positive. Then F(x) = f(x)f(-x), and F(-x) = f(-x)f(x) = F(x), which would make it even, not odd. So, statement (B) is also incorrect.Option (C): f(x) - f(-x) is an even function.Let me define F(x) = f(x) - f(-x). To check if it's even, I need to see if F(-x) = F(x). Let's compute F(-x):F(-x) = f(-x) - f(-(-x)) = f(-x) - f(x) = -(f(x) - f(-x)) = -F(x)So, F(-x) = -F(x), which means F(x) is odd, not even. Therefore, statement (C) is incorrect.Finally, option (D): f(x) + f(-x) is an even function.Define F(x) = f(x) + f(-x). Let's check if it's even by computing F(-x):F(-x) = f(-x) + f(-(-x)) = f(-x) + f(x) = f(x) + f(-x) = F(x)So, F(-x) = F(x), which means F(x) is even. Therefore, statement (D) is correct.Wait, let me double-check my reasoning for each option to make sure I didn't make a mistake.For (A), I concluded it's even because F(-x) = F(x). That seems right because multiplying f(x) and f(-x) would give the same product regardless of the sign of x.For (B), I saw that F(-x) = f(-x)|f(x)|, and compared it to -F(x) = -f(x)|f(-x)|. Unless f(x) is zero or has specific properties, these aren't necessarily equal. So, (B) isn't necessarily odd.For (C), I found that F(-x) = -F(x), so it's odd, not even. That makes sense because subtracting f(-x) flips the sign when you reflect over y-axis.For (D), adding f(x) and f(-x) gives a function that is symmetric, so it's even. That checks out.I think my reasoning is solid. So, the correct answer should be (D)."},{"question":"In an ( n times n ) (where ( n geq 2 )) grid, place ( 2n ) pieces arbitrarily, with each piece placed at the center of a cell. Prove that there must be 4 pieces that form the vertices of a parallelogram.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an n by n grid, and I need to place 2n pieces on it. The goal is to prove that no matter how I place these pieces, there will always be four that form the vertices of a parallelogram. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a parallelogram has opposite sides that are equal and parallel, so maybe that has something to do with it.First, let me visualize the grid. It's an n by n grid, so there are n rows and n columns. Each piece is placed at the center of a cell, so their positions can be identified by their row and column numbers. If I think of the grid as a coordinate system, each piece has coordinates (i, j), where i is the row number and j is the column number.Now, I need to place 2n pieces on this grid. Since n is at least 2, the smallest grid I need to consider is 2x2, but the problem is general for any n >= 2. So, in a 2x2 grid, placing 4 pieces would mean filling the entire grid, and obviously, all four pieces form a parallelogram because it's a square, which is a special case of a parallelogram. But the problem is more interesting for larger grids.Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use the Pigeonhole Principle. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least two pigeons must share a pigeonhole. How can I apply this here?If I consider the rows of the grid as pigeonholes and the pieces as pigeons, then placing 2n pieces into n rows means that on average, each row has 2 pieces. But since we're dealing with integers, some rows might have more than 2, and some might have fewer. Wait, but 2n pieces in n rows means that each row must have exactly 2 pieces on average. So, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one row with at least 2 pieces. But actually, since 2n divided by n is exactly 2, every row must have exactly 2 pieces if we distribute them evenly. But the problem says the pieces are placed arbitrarily, so some rows could have more, and some could have fewer.Wait, no. If I have 2n pieces and n rows, the average number of pieces per row is 2. So, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one row with at least 2 pieces. But actually, since 2n is exactly 2 per row, it's possible that each row has exactly 2 pieces. So, maybe I need to think differently.Perhaps I should consider the columns instead. If I have n columns and 2n pieces, then on average, each column has 2 pieces as well. So, similar to the rows, each column could have 2 pieces on average. But again, the placement is arbitrary, so some columns might have more, and some might have fewer.Wait, maybe I need to think about pairs of pieces in the same row or column. If I have two pieces in the same row, they form a horizontal line segment. Similarly, two pieces in the same column form a vertical line segment. For a parallelogram, I need two pairs of such line segments that are parallel and equal in length.So, maybe if I can find two pairs of pieces in different rows that have the same horizontal distance between them, that would form a parallelogram. Let me try to formalize this.Suppose in row i, there are two pieces at columns j and k. The distance between them is |k - j|. Similarly, in another row l, if there are two pieces at columns m and n, and |n - m| equals |k - j|, then these four pieces would form a parallelogram.So, the idea is that if two different rows have pairs of pieces with the same horizontal distance, then those four pieces form a parallelogram. Now, how can I ensure that such pairs exist?Given that there are n rows and 2n pieces, the average number of pieces per row is 2. So, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one row with at least 2 pieces. But actually, since 2n is exactly 2 per row, it's possible that each row has exactly 2 pieces. So, in that case, each row has exactly one pair of pieces, and the distances between these pairs could vary.But the number of possible distances in a row is limited. In an n-column grid, the possible distances between two pieces are 1, 2, ..., up to n-1. So, there are n-1 possible distances.Now, if I have n rows, each with one pair of pieces, and n-1 possible distances, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these pairs must have the same distance. Therefore, there must be at least two rows with pairs of pieces that have the same horizontal distance. These four pieces would then form a parallelogram.Wait, that seems to make sense. Let me double-check. If each row has exactly 2 pieces, then there are n pairs of pieces, each with some distance between them. Since there are only n-1 possible distances, two of these pairs must share the same distance. Therefore, these two pairs in different rows would form a parallelogram.But what if some rows have more than 2 pieces? For example, if a row has 3 pieces, then there are multiple pairs in that row. Specifically, if a row has r pieces, there are C(r, 2) = r(r-1)/2 pairs. So, if some rows have more than 2 pieces, the number of pairs increases, which would mean more distances to consider. But the number of possible distances is still n-1. So, with more pairs, the likelihood of having the same distance increases, which would still lead to the conclusion that there must be at least two pairs with the same distance.Therefore, regardless of how the 2n pieces are distributed across the n rows, there must be at least two pairs of pieces in different rows with the same horizontal distance, forming a parallelogram.I think this approach is solid. I used the Pigeonhole Principle twice: first to ensure that there are enough pairs of pieces, and second to ensure that at least two of these pairs have the same distance, leading to a parallelogram. This seems to cover all possible configurations of the 2n pieces on the grid.Just to make sure, let me consider a small example. Let's take n=2, so a 2x2 grid. Placing 4 pieces, which is 2n=4. Each row must have exactly 2 pieces since 4 pieces in 2 rows. The possible distances in each row are 1 (since n=2, distance can only be 1). So, both rows have pairs with distance 1. Therefore, these four pieces form a parallelogram, which in this case is a square.Another example: n=3, a 3x3 grid. Placing 6 pieces. Suppose each row has 2 pieces. The possible distances are 1 and 2. There are 3 rows, so 3 pairs. Since there are only 2 possible distances, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two pairs must have the same distance. Therefore, these two pairs form a parallelogram.If a row has 3 pieces, then there are C(3,2)=3 pairs in that row. So, with 3 rows, and some rows having 3 pieces, the number of pairs increases, but the number of possible distances remains 2. Therefore, even more likely to have multiple pairs with the same distance.So, this reasoning seems to hold for any n >= 2. Therefore, I can conclude that in any n x n grid with 2n pieces, there must be four pieces that form the vertices of a parallelogram."},{"question":"Given a convex quadrilateral A B M C with A B = B C, angle B A M = 30^circ, and angle A C M = 150^circ. Prove that A M is the bisector of angle B M C.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to prove that AM is the bisector of angle BMC in a convex quadrilateral ABMC. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's list out what's given:1. AB = BC. So, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB equal to BC.2. Angle BAM is 30 degrees.3. Angle ACM is 150 degrees.And I need to prove that AM bisects angle BMC. That means I have to show that angle AMB is equal to angle AMC.Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this quadrilateral. Since it's convex, all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the points are arranged such that the sides don't cross each other.Let me sketch this out mentally. Points A, B, M, and C form a convex quadrilateral. AB equals BC, so B is equidistant from A and C. Angle BAM is 30 degrees, so from point A, the line AM makes a 30-degree angle with AB. Similarly, angle ACM is 150 degrees, which is quite a large angle, almost a straight line.Since AB = BC, triangle ABC is isosceles with base AC. Wait, no, actually, AB = BC, so the base would be AC, and the equal sides are AB and BC. So, vertex B is opposite the base AC.Given that angle BAM is 30 degrees, that tells me something about the orientation of AM relative to AB. Similarly, angle ACM is 150 degrees, which is supplementary to 30 degrees. That might be a clue.I think I should consider triangles ABM and CBM. Since AB = BC, maybe there's some congruency or similarity here. But I'm not sure yet.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles here. Let me think about triangle ABM first.In triangle ABM, we know angle BAM is 30 degrees. If I can find another angle or a side, maybe I can relate it to triangle CBM.Wait, but I don't know much about triangle CBM yet. Let me see. In triangle ACM, angle ACM is 150 degrees. That's a big angle, so maybe triangle ACM is also something I can work with.Hold on, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. But I don't know all the angles yet, so that might not be directly helpful.Another idea: since AB = BC, maybe reflecting points over some axis could help. Reflections often help in geometry problems involving equal lengths.If I reflect point A over the line AM, where would it land? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, reflecting point C over AM? Maybe that could create some symmetry.Wait, another thought: if AM bisects angle BMC, then the ratio of BM to MC should be equal to the ratio of AB to AC, by the Angle Bisector Theorem. But I don't know if that applies here directly because I don't have information about the sides BM and MC.Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities in triangles ABM and ACM.Let me consider triangle ABM. I know angle BAM is 30 degrees. If I can find another angle, say angle ABM, then I can find the third angle, which is angle AMB.Similarly, in triangle ACM, I know angle ACM is 150 degrees. If I can find another angle, say angle CAM, then I can find the third angle, which is angle AMC.If I can show that angle AMB equals angle AMC, then AM bisects angle BMC.So, let's try to find some angles.In triangle ABM:- Angle at A: 30 degrees (given).- Let's denote angle at B as angle ABM = x.- Then, angle at M, which is angle AMB, would be 180 - 30 - x = 150 - x degrees.In triangle ACM:- Angle at C: 150 degrees (given).- Let's denote angle at A as angle CAM = y.- Then, angle at M, which is angle AMC, would be 180 - 150 - y = 30 - y degrees.Now, if I can relate x and y, maybe I can show that 150 - x = 30 - y, which would imply that x = y + 120.But I need another equation to relate x and y.Wait, since AB = BC, maybe triangles ABM and CBM have some relationship. Let me consider triangle CBM.In triangle CBM:- We know BC = AB (given).- We can denote angle at B as angle CBM = z.- Then, angle at M would be angle CMB = 180 - z - angle BCM.But I don't know angle BCM yet.Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABC.In triangle ABC:- AB = BC, so it's isosceles.- Therefore, angles at A and C are equal.Wait, no. In triangle ABC, sides AB = BC, so the base is AC, and the base angles are at A and C. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal.But wait, angle at A is angle BAC, which includes angle BAM (30 degrees) and angle CAM (y degrees). So, angle BAC = 30 + y.Similarly, angle at C is angle BCA, which includes angle ACM (150 degrees) and maybe another angle? Wait, no. In triangle ABC, angle at C is angle BCA, which is just angle BCA. But in the quadrilateral, angle at C is angle ACM, which is 150 degrees. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.Wait, in the quadrilateral ABMC, the angles at A and C are given as 30 degrees and 150 degrees respectively. But in triangle ABC, angles at A and C are equal because AB = BC.Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me think.In triangle ABC, since AB = BC, angles at A and C are equal. But in the quadrilateral ABMC, angle at A is 30 degrees (angle BAM) and angle at C is 150 degrees (angle ACM). So, perhaps triangle ABC is part of the quadrilateral, but the angles at A and C in the quadrilateral are different from those in triangle ABC.Wait, maybe I'm confusing the angles. Let me try to clarify.In quadrilateral ABMC, the angles at A and C are given as angle BAM = 30 degrees and angle ACM = 150 degrees. These are angles formed by the sides of the quadrilateral.In triangle ABC, which is part of the quadrilateral, the angles at A and C are different. Specifically, in triangle ABC, angle at A is angle BAC, which is angle BAM + angle MAC. Similarly, angle at C is angle BCA, which is angle ACM + angle MCB.But since AB = BC, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = BC, so angles at A and C are equal. Therefore, angle BAC = angle BCA.So, angle BAC = angle BCA.But angle BAC = angle BAM + angle MAC = 30 + y.Similarly, angle BCA = angle ACM + angle MCB = 150 + angle MCB.Therefore, 30 + y = 150 + angle MCB.So, angle MCB = 30 + y - 150 = y - 120.Hmm, that seems a bit odd because angles can't be negative. So, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, perhaps angle BCA is not angle ACM + angle MCB. Maybe it's the other way around.Wait, in the quadrilateral ABMC, point M is inside the quadrilateral, so when considering triangle ABC, point M is somewhere inside, so angle BCA in triangle ABC is actually angle BCM, which is part of angle ACM in the quadrilateral.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should label all the points and angles properly.Let me try to define all the angles step by step.In quadrilateral ABMC:- At point A: angle BAM = 30 degrees. So, the angle between BA and MA is 30 degrees.- At point C: angle ACM = 150 degrees. So, the angle between CA and MC is 150 degrees.In triangle ABC:- AB = BC, so it's isosceles with AB = BC.- Therefore, angles at A and C are equal.But in the quadrilateral, angle at A is 30 degrees, which is part of angle BAC in triangle ABC. Similarly, angle at C is 150 degrees, which is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC.Wait, so angle BAC in triangle ABC is equal to angle BCA. But angle BAC is composed of angle BAM (30 degrees) and angle MAC (let's call it y). Similarly, angle BCA is composed of angle ACM (150 degrees) and angle MCB (let's call it z).Since angles BAC and BCA are equal:30 + y = 150 + z.So, y - z = 120 degrees.That's one equation.Now, let's look at triangle ABM:- Angle at A: 30 degrees.- Angle at B: Let's call it x.- Angle at M: 180 - 30 - x = 150 - x.Similarly, in triangle ACM:- Angle at C: 150 degrees.- Angle at A: y degrees.- Angle at M: 180 - 150 - y = 30 - y.Now, in triangle CBM:- We know BC = AB, but not sure about the sides BM and CM.- Angles: At point B, angle CBM = let's say w.- At point C, angle BCM = z.- At point M, angle CMB = 180 - w - z.But I'm not sure if this helps.Wait, maybe considering the sum of angles around point M.In the quadrilateral ABMC, the sum of angles at M is angle AMB + angle AMC + angle BMC = 360 degrees? Wait, no, in a convex quadrilateral, the sum of internal angles is 360 degrees. But here, we're dealing with angles around point M, which is inside the quadrilateral.Wait, actually, point M is a vertex of the quadrilateral, so the angles at M are angle AMB and angle AMC, but I think I'm mixing things up.Wait, no. In a quadrilateral, each vertex has one angle. So, in quadrilateral ABMC, the angles are at A, B, M, and C. So, angle at M is angle BMC, which is the angle we're interested in bisecting.So, the sum of internal angles in quadrilateral ABMC is 360 degrees:angle at A (30 degrees) + angle at B + angle at M (angle BMC) + angle at C (150 degrees) = 360.So, 30 + angle B + angle BMC + 150 = 360.Therefore, angle B + angle BMC = 180 degrees.Hmm, that's interesting. So, angle B + angle BMC = 180.But I don't know angle B yet.Wait, in triangle ABC, which is part of the quadrilateral, angles at A and C are equal, as AB = BC.So, angle BAC = angle BCA.But angle BAC = 30 + y, and angle BCA = 150 + z, as we defined earlier.So, 30 + y = 150 + z => y = z + 120.And from triangle ABM and ACM, we have angles at M:angle AMB = 150 - x,angle AMC = 30 - y.But we need to relate these angles.Wait, maybe considering triangle ABM and triangle CBM.In triangle ABM:- AB is known, but we don't have lengths.Wait, maybe using the Law of Sines.In triangle ABM:AB / sin(angle AMB) = BM / sin(30) = AM / sin(x).Similarly, in triangle ACM:AC / sin(angle AMC) = CM / sin(y) = AM / sin(150).But I don't know AC or BM or CM.Wait, but AB = BC, so maybe we can relate these.Let me denote AB = BC = k.Then, in triangle ABM:k / sin(150 - x) = BM / sin(30) = AM / sin(x).In triangle ACM:AC / sin(30 - y) = CM / sin(y) = AM / sin(150).But AC is a side in triangle ABC, which is isosceles with AB = BC = k.In triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines:AC¬≤ = AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle ABC).But angle ABC is the angle at B in triangle ABC, which is equal to 180 - 2*(angle BAC).Since triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = BC, angles at A and C are equal, so angle BAC = angle BCA.From earlier, angle BAC = 30 + y,angle BCA = 150 + z,and 30 + y = 150 + z => y = z + 120.But angle ABC = 180 - 2*(30 + y) = 180 - 60 - 2y = 120 - 2y.So, AC¬≤ = k¬≤ + k¬≤ - 2*k*k*cos(120 - 2y) = 2k¬≤ - 2k¬≤*cos(120 - 2y).Hmm, this is getting complicated.Wait, maybe instead of using the Law of Cosines, I can use the Law of Sines in triangle ABC.In triangle ABC:AB / sin(angle BCA) = BC / sin(angle BAC) = AC / sin(angle ABC).But AB = BC = k,angle BAC = 30 + y,angle BCA = 150 + z,and angle ABC = 120 - 2y.So,k / sin(150 + z) = k / sin(30 + y) = AC / sin(120 - 2y).From the first two ratios:sin(30 + y) = sin(150 + z).But from earlier, y = z + 120,so sin(30 + y) = sin(150 + (y - 120)) = sin(30 + y).Wait, that's just an identity, so it doesn't give new information.Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.Wait, going back to the original problem: prove that AM bisects angle BMC.That means angle AMB = angle AMC.From earlier, in triangle ABM, angle AMB = 150 - x,and in triangle ACM, angle AMC = 30 - y.So, if angle AMB = angle AMC,then 150 - x = 30 - y,which simplifies to x = y + 120.So, if I can show that x = y + 120, then AM bisects angle BMC.But from earlier, we have y = z + 120,and from triangle ABC, angle BAC = 30 + y,angle BCA = 150 + z,and since angle BAC = angle BCA,30 + y = 150 + z,which gives y = z + 120.So, that's consistent.But how does that help me find x in terms of y?Wait, in triangle ABM, we have angles:30 degrees at A,x degrees at B,and 150 - x degrees at M.Similarly, in triangle ACM,150 degrees at C,y degrees at A,and 30 - y degrees at M.But I need another relationship between x and y.Wait, maybe considering triangle CBM.In triangle CBM,we have sides BC = k,BM,CM,and angles at B, C, and M.But I don't know much about triangle CBM.Alternatively, maybe considering the entire quadrilateral.We know that angle at B + angle BMC = 180 degrees,from earlier.So, angle B + angle BMC = 180.But angle B is angle ABC in triangle ABC, which is 120 - 2y.So, 120 - 2y + angle BMC = 180,which implies angle BMC = 60 + 2y.But angle BMC is the angle we're interested in bisecting.If AM bisects angle BMC, then each of the angles AMB and AMC would be (60 + 2y)/2 = 30 + y.But from triangle ABM, angle AMB = 150 - x,and from triangle ACM, angle AMC = 30 - y.So, setting angle AMB = angle AMC,150 - x = 30 - y,which gives x = y + 120.But from triangle ABM,sum of angles: 30 + x + (150 - x) = 180,which checks out.Similarly, in triangle ACM,sum of angles: 150 + y + (30 - y) = 180,which also checks out.So, the key is to show that x = y + 120.But how?Wait, in triangle ABC,angle ABC = 120 - 2y,and angle ABC is also equal to angle ABM + angle CBM.From quadrilateral ABMC,angle at B is angle ABC,which is composed of angle ABM (x) and angle CBM (let's say w).So, angle ABC = x + w = 120 - 2y.Similarly, in triangle CBM,angles are w at B,z at C,and angle CMB = 180 - w - z.But from earlier,angle BCA = 150 + z,and angle BAC = 30 + y,which are equal,so 30 + y = 150 + z,which gives z = y - 120.Wait, but z is an angle, so it must be positive.So, y - 120 > 0 => y > 120 degrees.But in triangle ACM,angle at M is 30 - y,which must be positive,so 30 - y > 0 => y < 30 degrees.But y > 120 and y < 30 can't both be true.This is a contradiction.Hmm, that suggests that my earlier assumption might be wrong.Wait, maybe I messed up the definition of angles.Let me go back.In triangle ABC,angle BAC = angle BCA.But in the quadrilateral,angle at A is angle BAM = 30 degrees,and angle at C is angle ACM = 150 degrees.So, angle BAC is actually angle BAM + angle MAC = 30 + y,and angle BCA is angle ACM + angle MCB = 150 + z.Therefore, 30 + y = 150 + z,so z = y - 120.But z is an angle in triangle CBM,so z must be positive,which implies y > 120 degrees.But in triangle ACM,angle at M is 30 - y,which must be positive,so y < 30 degrees.This is a contradiction because y can't be both greater than 120 and less than 30.So, where did I go wrong?Wait, maybe angle BCA is not angle ACM + angle MCB.Perhaps angle BCA is just angle MCB.Wait, in the quadrilateral ABMC,point M is connected to points A, B, and C.So, angle at C in the quadrilateral is angle ACM = 150 degrees,which is the angle between CA and CM.But in triangle ABC,angle at C is angle BCA,which is the angle between CB and CA.So, angle BCA is different from angle ACM.Wait, so angle BCA is the angle between CB and CA,and angle ACM is the angle between CA and CM.So, in triangle ABC,angle BCA is just angle BCA,and in the quadrilateral,angle at C is angle ACM = 150 degrees.So, perhaps angle BCA is equal to angle ACM?Wait, no, because angle BCA is part of triangle ABC,and angle ACM is part of the quadrilateral.Wait, maybe they are related.Wait, in triangle ABC,angle BCA is the angle between CB and CA,and in the quadrilateral,angle ACM is the angle between CA and CM.So, if I consider point M inside the quadrilateral,then angle BCA is equal to angle BCM + angle ACM.Wait, that might make sense.So, angle BCA = angle BCM + angle ACM.Given that angle ACM = 150 degrees,then angle BCA = angle BCM + 150.But in triangle ABC,angle BAC = angle BCA,so angle BAC = angle BCM + 150.But angle BAC is also equal to angle BAM + angle MAC = 30 + y.So,30 + y = angle BCM + 150,which implies angle BCM = y - 120.But angle BCM is an angle in triangle CBM,so it must be positive,which implies y > 120 degrees.But in triangle ACM,angle at M is 30 - y,which must be positive,so y < 30 degrees.Again, a contradiction.This suggests that my initial approach might be flawed.Maybe I need to consider a different method.Wait, perhaps using coordinate geometry.Let me assign coordinates to the points.Let me place point A at the origin (0,0).Let me assume AB is along the x-axis.So, point B is at (b, 0), for some b > 0.Given that AB = BC,point C must be somewhere such that BC = AB = b.So, point C is at (b + c, d), such that the distance from B to C is b.So,sqrt((c)^2 + (d)^2) = b,so c¬≤ + d¬≤ = b¬≤.Now, angle BAM is 30 degrees.So, line AM makes a 30-degree angle with AB.Since AB is along the x-axis,the slope of AM is tan(30) = 1/‚àö3.So, the equation of line AM is y = (1/‚àö3)x.Point M lies somewhere on this line.Similarly, angle ACM is 150 degrees.So, at point C, the angle between CA and CM is 150 degrees.Hmm, this might get complicated, but let's try.Let me denote point M as (m, m/‚àö3), since it's on line AM.Now, I need to express the angle ACM as 150 degrees.Vector approach might help here.Vector CA is from C to A: A - C = (- (b + c), -d).Vector CM is from C to M: M - C = (m - (b + c), (m/‚àö3) - d).The angle between vectors CA and CM is 150 degrees.So, the dot product formula:cos(theta) = (CA . CM) / (|CA| |CM|).So,cos(150¬∞) = [(- (b + c))(m - b - c) + (-d)((m/‚àö3) - d)] / (|CA| |CM|).This seems very involved, but let's try to write it out.First, compute CA . CM:= (- (b + c))(m - b - c) + (-d)((m/‚àö3) - d)= - (b + c)(m - b - c) - d(m/‚àö3 - d)= - (b + c)m + (b + c)¬≤ - (d m)/‚àö3 + d¬≤.Now, |CA| is the distance from C to A,which is sqrt((b + c)^2 + d^2).But since AB = BC = b,and AB is from (0,0) to (b,0),so AB length is b,and BC is from (b,0) to (b + c, d),so BC length is sqrt(c¬≤ + d¬≤) = b.Therefore, c¬≤ + d¬≤ = b¬≤.So, |CA| = sqrt((b + c)^2 + d^2) = sqrt(b¬≤ + 2bc + c¬≤ + d¬≤) = sqrt(2b¬≤ + 2bc).Similarly, |CM| is the distance from C to M,which is sqrt((m - b - c)^2 + (m/‚àö3 - d)^2).This is getting really complicated.Maybe there's a better way.Wait, perhaps using complex numbers.Let me place point A at 0,point B at 1 (for simplicity, let AB = 1),then point C is somewhere such that BC = 1.So, point C is at 1 + e^{i theta}, where theta is some angle.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities.Wait, I'm overcomplicating this.Let me try to think differently.Given that AB = BC,and angles at A and C are 30 and 150 degrees,maybe triangle ABM and triangle CBM have some relationship.Wait, if I can show that triangles ABM and CBM are similar,then corresponding angles would be equal,and thus AM would bisect angle BMC.But for similarity, I need corresponding angles to be equal.Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangles ABM and CBM.In triangle ABM:AB / sin(angle AMB) = BM / sin(30) = AM / sin(angle ABM).In triangle CBM:BC / sin(angle CMB) = BM / sin(angle BCM) = CM / sin(angle CBM).But AB = BC,so AB / sin(angle AMB) = BC / sin(angle CMB),which implies sin(angle AMB) = sin(angle CMB).Therefore, angle AMB = angle CMB or angle AMB = 180 - angle CMB.But since the quadrilateral is convex,angle AMB and angle CMB are both less than 180,so angle AMB = angle CMB.Therefore, AM bisects angle BMC.Wait, that seems promising.Let me write this more formally.In triangles ABM and CBM,since AB = BC,and both have side BM,by the Law of Sines,AB / sin(angle AMB) = BM / sin(30),and BC / sin(angle CMB) = BM / sin(angle BCM).But AB = BC,so AB / sin(angle AMB) = BC / sin(angle CMB),which implies sin(angle AMB) = sin(angle CMB).Therefore, angle AMB = angle CMB,since both are less than 180 degrees in a convex quadrilateral.Hence, AM bisects angle BMC.Yes, that makes sense.So, the key idea is using the Law of Sines in triangles ABM and CBM,noting that AB = BC,and thus the sines of angles AMB and CMB are equal,leading to the conclusion that those angles are equal,hence AM is the bisector of angle BMC.I think that's the proof."},{"question":"Given the expansion of ((x-m)^{7}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+ldots+a_{7}x^{7}) where the coefficient of (x^{4}) is (-35),  ((1)) find the value of (a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{7});  ((2)) find the value of (a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5}+a_{7}).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about expanding ((x - m)^7) and finding some coefficients. Let me try to understand what's being asked.First, the expansion is given as ((x - m)^7 = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ldots + a_7 x^7). They mention that the coefficient of (x^4) is (-35). I need to find two things: 1. The sum of the coefficients from (a_1) to (a_7).2. The sum of the coefficients of the odd-powered terms, which are (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7).Alright, let's tackle the first part.**Part 1: Finding (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7)**I remember that in polynomial expansions, the sum of all coefficients can be found by plugging in (x = 1). So, if I set (x = 1) in the expansion, I get:[(1 - m)^7 = a_0 + a_1(1) + a_2(1)^2 + ldots + a_7(1)^7 = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7]So, the sum of all coefficients is ((1 - m)^7). But the question only asks for the sum from (a_1) to (a_7), which means I need to subtract (a_0) from this total.To find (a_0), I can set (x = 0) in the expansion:[(0 - m)^7 = a_0 + a_1(0) + a_2(0)^2 + ldots + a_7(0)^7 = a_0]So, (a_0 = (-m)^7). Since (m) is a real number, this simplifies to (-m^7).But wait, I don't know the value of (m) yet. Hmm, the problem gives me the coefficient of (x^4) as (-35). Let me use that to find (m).**Finding (m):**The general term in the expansion of ((x - m)^7) is given by the binomial theorem:[T_{r+1} = binom{7}{r} x^{7 - r} (-m)^r]The coefficient of (x^4) corresponds to the term where (7 - r = 4), so (r = 3). Therefore, the coefficient is:[binom{7}{3} (-m)^3 = -35]Calculating (binom{7}{3}):[binom{7}{3} = frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = frac{7 times 6 times 5}{3 times 2 times 1} = 35]So, plugging back in:[35 times (-m)^3 = -35]Divide both sides by 35:[(-m)^3 = -1]Taking the cube root of both sides:[-m = -1 implies m = 1]Great, so (m = 1).**Back to Part 1:**Now that I know (m = 1), I can find (a_0):[a_0 = (-1)^7 = -1]And the sum of all coefficients is:[(1 - 1)^7 = 0^7 = 0]So, the sum (a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7 = 0). Therefore, the sum from (a_1) to (a_7) is:[a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7 = 0 - a_0 = 0 - (-1) = 1]So, the answer to part (1) is 1.**Part 2: Finding (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7)**This time, I need the sum of the coefficients of the odd-powered terms. I remember that to find the sum of coefficients of even-powered terms, you can use (x = 1) and (x = -1), and average them. Similarly, for odd-powered terms, you can subtract the two results.Let me recall the method:If I set (x = 1), I get the sum of all coefficients:[(1 - m)^7 = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7 = 0]If I set (x = -1), I get:[(-1 - m)^7 = a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_6 - a_7]Let me compute this value with (m = 1):[(-1 - 1)^7 = (-2)^7 = -128]So, (a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_6 - a_7 = -128)Let me denote:Sum of all coefficients: (S = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7 = 0)Sum at (x = -1): (S' = a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_6 - a_7 = -128)If I subtract (S') from (S), I get:[S - S' = (a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7) - (a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_6 - a_7)]Simplifying:[S - S' = 2(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7)]Plugging in the known values:[0 - (-128) = 2(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7)][128 = 2(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7)][a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 64]So, the answer to part (2) is 64.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Found (m = 1) correctly using the coefficient of (x^4).2. Calculated (a_0 = -1) correctly.3. Sum of all coefficients at (x = 1) is 0, so sum from (a_1) to (a_7) is 1. That seems right.4. For part (2), calculated (x = -1) gives (-128), which is correct because ((-2)^7 = -128).5. Then, subtracting (S' = -128) from (S = 0) gives 128, which equals twice the sum of the odd coefficients. So, dividing by 2 gives 64.Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.**Final Answer**(1) (boxed{1})(2) (boxed{64})"},{"question":"In a company, the manager wants to give some gifts to all of the workers.

Let me try to figure out part (I) first. The inequality given is (x - 1)^2 ‚â§ a^2, where a is greater than 0. I need to find the solution set A for this inequality. Hmm, I remember that when you have an inequality like (x - c)^2 ‚â§ a^2, it translates to the absolute value inequality |x - c| ‚â§ a. So in this case, |x - 1| ‚â§ a. That means x is within a distance of a from 1 on the number line. So the solution set A should be all x such that 1 - a ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1 + a. So A is the interval [1 - a, 1 + a].Next, the function f(x) is given as lg((x - 2)/(x + 2)). I need to find the definition domain B for this function. Since it's a logarithm, the argument inside must be positive. So (x - 2)/(x + 2) > 0. To solve this inequality, I can consider the critical points where the numerator or denominator is zero, which are x = 2 and x = -2. These points divide the number line into three intervals: (-‚àû, -2), (-2, 2), and (2, ‚àû). I'll test each interval:1. For x < -2, say x = -3: (-3 - 2)/(-3 + 2) = (-5)/(-1) = 5 > 0. So this interval is part of the solution.2. For -2 < x < 2, say x = 0: (0 - 2)/(0 + 2) = (-2)/2 = -1 < 0. So this interval is not part of the solution.3. For x > 2, say x = 3: (3 - 2)/(3 + 2) = 1/5 > 0. So this interval is part of the solution.Therefore, the domain B is (-‚àû, -2) ‚à™ (2, ‚àû).Now, the problem states that A ‚à© B = œÜ, which means the intersection of sets A and B is empty. So there are no x values that are in both A and B. Given that A is [1 - a, 1 + a] and B is (-‚àû, -2) ‚à™ (2, ‚àû), for their intersection to be empty, the interval [1 - a, 1 + a] must not overlap with either (-‚àû, -2) or (2, ‚àû). Let me visualize this. The interval A is centered at 1 with a radius of a. The set B is everything to the left of -2 and everything to the right of 2. So for A and B not to overlap, the entire interval A must lie between -2 and 2. So, the left end of A, which is 1 - a, must be greater than or equal to -2, and the right end of A, which is 1 + a, must be less than or equal to 2. So, setting up the inequalities:1. 1 - a ‚â• -22. 1 + a ‚â§ 2Let me solve these:1. 1 - a ‚â• -2Subtract 1 from both sides: -a ‚â• -3Multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality): a ‚â§ 32. 1 + a ‚â§ 2Subtract 1 from both sides: a ‚â§ 1Since a > 0, combining these two results, a must be less than or equal to 1. So the range of values for a is 0 < a ‚â§ 1.Wait, let me double-check. If a is 1, then A is [0, 2]. Does this interval overlap with B? B is (-‚àû, -2) ‚à™ (2, ‚àû). So [0, 2] doesn't overlap with B because it stops at 2, which is not included in B. Similarly, if a is less than 1, say a = 0.5, then A is [0.5, 1.5], which is entirely within (-2, 2), so no overlap with B. If a were greater than 1, say a = 2, then A would be [-1, 3]. This interval would overlap with B at (2, 3), which is part of B. So indeed, a must be ‚â§ 1.Okay, that seems solid.Now, moving on to part (II). I need to prove that the graph of f(x) = lg((x - 2)/(x + 2)) is symmetric about the origin. Symmetric about the origin means that the function is odd, i.e., f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain. So I should check if this holds.Let me compute f(-x):f(-x) = lg((-x - 2)/(-x + 2)) = lg(( - (x + 2))/( - (x - 2))) = lg((x + 2)/(x - 2))Wait, let me simplify that step by step:(-x - 2) = -(x + 2)(-x + 2) = -(x - 2)So f(-x) = lg( [-(x + 2)] / [-(x - 2)] ) = lg( (x + 2)/(x - 2) )Now, let's see what -f(x) is:-f(x) = -lg((x - 2)/(x + 2)) = lg( [ (x - 2)/(x + 2) ]^{-1} ) = lg( (x + 2)/(x - 2) )So f(-x) = lg( (x + 2)/(x - 2) ) and -f(x) is also lg( (x + 2)/(x - 2) ). Therefore, f(-x) = -f(x), which means f is an odd function. Therefore, the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the origin.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra. Starting with f(-x):f(-x) = lg( (-x - 2)/(-x + 2) )Factor out -1 from numerator and denominator:= lg( [ -1*(x + 2) ] / [ -1*(x - 2) ] )The -1s cancel out:= lg( (x + 2)/(x - 2) )Which is the same as:= lg( (x + 2)/(x - 2) )And -f(x) is:= -lg( (x - 2)/(x + 2) )= lg( (x - 2)/(x + 2) )^{-1}= lg( (x + 2)/(x - 2) )Yes, so f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, the function is odd, so its graph is symmetric about the origin.I think that's correct. Maybe I should test with a specific value to be sure. Let's pick x = 3.f(3) = lg( (3 - 2)/(3 + 2) ) = lg(1/5) = lg(0.2) ‚âà -0.69897f(-3) = lg( (-3 - 2)/(-3 + 2) ) = lg( (-5)/(-1) ) = lg(5) ‚âà 0.69897So f(-3) ‚âà 0.69897, which is approximately -f(3). So it checks out for x = 3.Another test with x = 1 (though x=1 is not in the domain, so maybe x=4):f(4) = lg( (4 - 2)/(4 + 2) ) = lg(2/6) = lg(1/3) ‚âà -0.4771f(-4) = lg( (-4 - 2)/(-4 + 2) ) = lg( (-6)/(-2) ) = lg(3) ‚âà 0.4771Again, f(-4) ‚âà 0.4771 ‚âà -f(4). So it seems to hold.Therefore, I'm confident that the function is odd, hence symmetric about the origin.**Final Answer**(I) The range of values for ( a ) is (boxed{0 < a leqslant 1}).(II) The graph of ( f(x) ) is symmetric about the origin, as proven."},{"question":"A certain store introduced a new batch of helmets at a price of 60 yuan each.

What is the maximum value?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a store selling helmets. Let me try to understand what's going on here. The store introduced a new batch of helmets at 60 yuan each. They did some market research and found that if they set the price at 100 yuan each, they could sell 200 helmets per month. But now, they want to reduce the price to cooperate with a traffic management campaign. For every 4 yuan reduction in price, they can sell an additional 40 helmets per month.Okay, so they want me to figure out a few things. First, the relationship between the price after reduction, which is x, and the number of helmets sold, y. Then, they want the relationship between the monthly profit, w, and x. Finally, they want to know at what price x the profit w is maximized and what that maximum profit is.Let me start with part (1). So, when the price is 100 yuan, they sell 200 helmets. For every 4 yuan reduction, they sell 40 more helmets. So, if the price is reduced by 4 yuan, they sell 240 helmets. If it's reduced by 8 yuan, they sell 280, and so on.I need to express y in terms of x. So, x is the price after reduction, which is between 60 and 100 yuan. The original price was 100, and they can reduce it down to 60. So, the amount they reduce the price is 100 - x yuan.Since for every 4 yuan reduction, they get 40 more helmets sold, the number of additional helmets sold would be (100 - x)/4 * 40. Let me write that down:Additional helmets = ((100 - x)/4) * 40Simplify that:Additional helmets = (100 - x) * 10So, the total number of helmets sold, y, is the original 200 plus this additional amount:y = 200 + 10*(100 - x)Let me compute that:y = 200 + 1000 - 10xy = 1200 - 10xSo, the functional relationship between y and x is y = -10x + 1200. That seems straightforward.Moving on to part (2). They want the monthly profit w in terms of x. Profit is generally calculated as (selling price - cost price) * number of units sold. Here, the cost price is 60 yuan per helmet, right? Because they introduced the batch at 60 yuan each.So, the profit per helmet is (x - 60) yuan. And the number of helmets sold is y, which we already have as a function of x.So, w = (x - 60) * yBut y is -10x + 1200, so substitute that in:w = (x - 60)*(-10x + 1200)Let me expand that:First, distribute (x - 60) over (-10x + 1200):w = x*(-10x + 1200) - 60*(-10x + 1200)Compute each term:x*(-10x + 1200) = -10x^2 + 1200x-60*(-10x + 1200) = 600x - 72000Now, combine these:w = (-10x^2 + 1200x) + (600x - 72000)Combine like terms:-10x^2 + (1200x + 600x) - 72000-10x^2 + 1800x - 72000So, the functional relationship between w and x is w = -10x^2 + 1800x - 72000.Alright, that takes care of part (2). Now, part (3) asks for the value of x that maximizes w and the maximum value of w.Since w is a quadratic function in terms of x, and the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-10), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.The general form of a quadratic is ax^2 + bx + c, and the vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a). Let's apply that here.Here, a = -10, b = 1800.So, x = -1800/(2*(-10)) = -1800/(-20) = 90.So, the price x that maximizes profit is 90 yuan.Now, let's find the maximum profit w at x = 90.We can plug x = 90 into the equation for w:w = -10*(90)^2 + 1800*(90) - 72000First, compute 90 squared:90^2 = 8100So,w = -10*8100 + 1800*90 - 72000Compute each term:-10*8100 = -810001800*90 = 162000So,w = -81000 + 162000 - 72000Combine the first two terms:-81000 + 162000 = 81000Then,81000 - 72000 = 9000So, the maximum profit is 9000 yuan.Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, for y = -10x + 1200. At x = 100, y = -1000 + 1200 = 200, which matches the given information. At x = 60, y = -600 + 1200 = 600. So, that seems correct.For w, at x = 100, w = (100 - 60)*200 = 40*200 = 8000 yuan.At x = 90, w = 9000 yuan, which is higher, as expected.At x = 60, w = (60 - 60)*600 = 0*600 = 0 yuan, which makes sense because they're selling at cost.So, the maximum profit occurs at x = 90 yuan, and the maximum profit is 9000 yuan.I think that all checks out.**Final Answer**(1) The functional relationship is boxed{y = -10x + 1200}.(2) The functional relationship is boxed{w = -10x^2 + 1800x - 72000}.(3) The maximum monthly profit occurs at boxed{x = 90} yuan, and the maximum profit is boxed{9000} yuan."},{"question":"If z(1-i)=2, then z=left(  right)A: 1-iB: 1+iC: -1-iD: -1+i","answer":"First, I need to solve the equation ( z(1 - i) = 2 ) for ( z ).To isolate ( z ), I can divide both sides of the equation by ( (1 - i) ):[z = frac{2}{1 - i}]Next, to simplify the expression ( frac{2}{1 - i} ), I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is ( (1 + i) ):[z = frac{2(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)}]Calculating the denominator:[(1 - i)(1 + i) = 1^2 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2]Now, the equation becomes:[z = frac{2(1 + i)}{2} = 1 + i]Therefore, the value of ( z ) is ( 1 + i ), which corresponds to option B."},{"question":"Given the sets A={x|x^2-2x-3<0} and B={x|x>1}, then Acap B equals to ( )A: {x|x>1}B: {x|x<3}C: {x|1<x<3}D: {x|-1<x<1}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two sets, A and B. Set A is defined as all real numbers x such that x squared minus 2x minus 3 is less than zero. Set B is all real numbers x where x is greater than 1. I need to find the intersection of A and B, which is A ‚à© B, and then choose the correct option from the given choices.First, let me understand what set A is. The inequality given is x¬≤ - 2x - 3 < 0. I think I need to solve this quadratic inequality to find the values of x that satisfy it. To solve quadratic inequalities, I remember that I should first find the roots of the quadratic equation x¬≤ - 2x - 3 = 0. Once I have the roots, I can determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is positive or negative.So, let me solve x¬≤ - 2x - 3 = 0. I can use the quadratic formula here, which is x = [2 ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)] / 2a. In this equation, a is 1, b is -2, and c is -3. Plugging these values in, I get:x = [2 ¬± ‚àö((-2)¬≤ - 4*1*(-3))] / (2*1)x = [2 ¬± ‚àö(4 + 12)] / 2x = [2 ¬± ‚àö16] / 2x = [2 ¬± 4] / 2So, that gives me two solutions:x = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3x = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1Okay, so the roots are x = -1 and x = 3. These roots divide the real number line into three intervals:1. x < -12. -1 < x < 33. x > 3Now, I need to test each interval to see where the quadratic expression x¬≤ - 2x - 3 is negative (less than zero). I'll pick a test point from each interval.For the first interval, x < -1, let's choose x = -2.Plugging into the expression: (-2)¬≤ - 2*(-2) - 3 = 4 + 4 - 3 = 5, which is positive. So, the expression is positive in this interval.For the second interval, -1 < x < 3, let's choose x = 0.Plugging into the expression: 0¬≤ - 2*0 - 3 = -3, which is negative. So, the expression is negative here.For the third interval, x > 3, let's choose x = 4.Plugging into the expression: 4¬≤ - 2*4 - 3 = 16 - 8 - 3 = 5, which is positive. So, the expression is positive in this interval.Since we're looking for where the expression is less than zero, the solution is the interval where it's negative, which is -1 < x < 3. Therefore, set A is {x | -1 < x < 3}.Now, set B is given as {x | x > 1}. So, set B is all real numbers greater than 1.To find the intersection of A and B, A ‚à© B, we're looking for all x that are in both A and B. That means x must satisfy both -1 < x < 3 and x > 1.Let me visualize this on the number line. Set A is from -1 to 3, and set B is everything to the right of 1. The overlap between these two sets would be from 1 to 3 because that's where both conditions are satisfied.So, A ‚à© B is {x | 1 < x < 3}.Looking at the options given:A: {x | x > 1} ‚Äì This is set B, but we need the intersection, which is more specific.B: {x | x < 3} ‚Äì This is a larger set than A ‚à© B.C: {x | 1 < x < 3} ‚Äì This matches what I found.D: {x | -1 < x < 1} ‚Äì This is part of set A but doesn't intersect with set B.Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check my steps.1. Solved the quadratic equation correctly: roots at x = -1 and x = 3. That seems right.2. Tested intervals correctly: positive before -1, negative between -1 and 3, positive after 3. So, A is indeed (-1, 3).3. Set B is (1, ‚àû). Intersection of (-1, 3) and (1, ‚àû) is (1, 3). That makes sense.Yes, I think I did it correctly. So, I'm confident that option C is the right answer.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Compute dbinom{60}{2}.","answer":"First, I need to calculate the binomial coefficient (dbinom{60}{2}).

Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, looking at the expression for ( M ), it seems a bit complicated with all those powers of 72 and the coefficients. I wonder if there's a pattern or a way to simplify this. The coefficients 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1 look familiar. Wait, those are the binomial coefficients from the 5th row of Pascal's Triangle! That is, they correspond to the coefficients in the expansion of ( (a + b)^5 ). So, maybe this expression is actually a binomial expansion. Let me test that idea. If I let ( a = 72 ) and ( b = 1 ), then ( (a + b)^5 ) would expand to:( a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5 )Plugging in ( a = 72 ) and ( b = 1 ), this becomes:( 72^5 + 5cdot72^4cdot1 + 10cdot72^3cdot1^2 + 10cdot72^2cdot1^3 + 5cdot72cdot1^4 + 1^5 )Simplifying that, since ( 1 ) to any power is just ( 1 ), we get:( 72^5 + 5cdot72^4 + 10cdot72^3 + 10cdot72^2 + 5cdot72 + 1 )Hey, that's exactly the expression for ( M )! So, ( M = (72 + 1)^5 ), which simplifies to ( 73^5 ).Okay, so now I know that ( M = 73^5 ). The question is asking how many positive integers are factors of ( M ). To find the number of positive divisors of a number, I remember that if a number is expressed in its prime factorization form, say ( N = p_1^{e_1} cdot p_2^{e_2} cdot ldots cdot p_n^{e_n} ), then the number of positive divisors of ( N ) is ( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)ldots(e_n + 1) ).In this case, ( M = 73^5 ). Since 73 is a prime number, the prime factorization of ( M ) is just ( 73^5 ). So, applying the formula for the number of divisors, we have only one prime factor, 73, raised to the 5th power. Therefore, the number of positive divisors is ( 5 + 1 = 6 ).Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The expression for ( M ) does indeed match the expansion of ( (72 + 1)^5 ), which is ( 73^5 ). Since 73 is prime, its only divisors are 1, 73, ( 73^2 ), ( 73^3 ), ( 73^4 ), and ( 73^5 ). That's six divisors in total. So, the answer should be 6, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Given the sequence {a_n}, where a_1= frac {5}{6},a_2= frac {19}{36}, and the sequence {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of (-1), where b_n=log _{2}(a_{n+1}- frac {a_n}{3}). The sequence {c_n} is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of ( frac {1}{3}), where c_n=a_{n+1}- frac {a_n}{2}. Find the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}, i.e., a_n= _____ .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about sequences, and I need to find the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.First, I know that {a_n} is a sequence where a‚ÇÅ = 5/6 and a‚ÇÇ = 19/36. Then, there are two other sequences defined in terms of {a_n}: {b_n} and {c_n}.The sequence {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -1. The definition of {b_n} is given as b_n = log‚ÇÇ(a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3). Since it's an arithmetic sequence, each term decreases by 1 from the previous term. The sequence {c_n} is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 1/3. The definition of {c_n} is c_n = a_{n+1} - (a_n)/2. So, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 1/3.My goal is to find a general formula for a_n. Let me break this down.First, let's handle the sequence {b_n}. Since it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -1, I can write the general term as:b_n = b‚ÇÅ + (n - 1)(-1) = b‚ÇÅ - (n - 1)But I don't know b‚ÇÅ yet. I can find b‚ÇÅ using the given information. Since b_n = log‚ÇÇ(a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3), then for n=1:b‚ÇÅ = log‚ÇÇ(a‚ÇÇ - (a‚ÇÅ)/3)We know a‚ÇÅ = 5/6 and a‚ÇÇ = 19/36. Let's compute a‚ÇÇ - (a‚ÇÅ)/3:a‚ÇÇ = 19/36(a‚ÇÅ)/3 = (5/6)/3 = 5/18So, a‚ÇÇ - (a‚ÇÅ)/3 = 19/36 - 5/18To subtract these fractions, they need a common denominator. 36 is a common denominator:19/36 - 10/36 = 9/36 = 1/4So, b‚ÇÅ = log‚ÇÇ(1/4). Since 1/4 is 2^(-2), log‚ÇÇ(1/4) = -2.Therefore, b‚ÇÅ = -2.Now, the general term for {b_n} is:b_n = -2 + (n - 1)(-1) = -2 - n + 1 = -n -1So, b_n = - (n + 1)But we also have that b_n = log‚ÇÇ(a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3). Therefore:log‚ÇÇ(a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3) = - (n + 1)To solve for a_{n+1}, we can rewrite this equation in exponential form:a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3 = 2^{ - (n + 1)} = (1/2)^{n + 1}Let me write this as equation (1):a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3 = (1/2)^{n + 1}  ...(1)Now, let's move on to the sequence {c_n}. It's a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 1/3, and c_n = a_{n+1} - (a_n)/2.First, let's find c‚ÇÅ. Since c_n is a geometric sequence, c‚ÇÅ is the first term, and then each subsequent term is multiplied by 1/3.c‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÇ - (a‚ÇÅ)/2We have a‚ÇÅ = 5/6 and a‚ÇÇ = 19/36. Let's compute this:a‚ÇÇ = 19/36(a‚ÇÅ)/2 = (5/6)/2 = 5/12So, c‚ÇÅ = 19/36 - 5/12Again, let's find a common denominator, which is 36:19/36 - 15/36 = 4/36 = 1/9Therefore, c‚ÇÅ = 1/9.Since {c_n} is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/3, the general term is:c_n = c‚ÇÅ * (1/3)^{n - 1} = (1/9) * (1/3)^{n - 1} = (1/3)^{n + 1}Because (1/9) is (1/3)^2, so (1/3)^2 * (1/3)^{n - 1} = (1/3)^{n + 1}.Therefore, c_n = (1/3)^{n + 1}But c_n is also equal to a_{n+1} - (a_n)/2. So,a_{n+1} - (a_n)/2 = (1/3)^{n + 1}  ...(2)Now, we have two equations:From equation (1): a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3 = (1/2)^{n + 1}From equation (2): a_{n+1} - (a_n)/2 = (1/3)^{n + 1}Let me write both equations:1) a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3 = (1/2)^{n + 1}2) a_{n+1} - (a_n)/2 = (1/3)^{n + 1}I can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a_{n+1}:[ a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3 ] - [ a_{n+1} - (a_n)/2 ] = (1/2)^{n + 1} - (1/3)^{n + 1}Simplify the left side:a_{n+1} - (a_n)/3 - a_{n+1} + (a_n)/2 = (1/2)^{n + 1} - (1/3)^{n + 1}The a_{n+1} terms cancel out:- (a_n)/3 + (a_n)/2 = (1/2)^{n + 1} - (1/3)^{n + 1}Let me combine the terms on the left:(-1/3 + 1/2) a_n = (1/2)^{n + 1} - (1/3)^{n + 1}Compute -1/3 + 1/2:Convert to common denominator, which is 6:-2/6 + 3/6 = 1/6So, (1/6) a_n = (1/2)^{n + 1} - (1/3)^{n + 1}Therefore, solving for a_n:a_n = 6 [ (1/2)^{n + 1} - (1/3)^{n + 1} ]Let me write this as:a_n = 6 left( left( frac{1}{2} right)^{n + 1} - left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n + 1} right )Alternatively, this can be written as:a_n = 6 cdot left( frac{1}{2^{n + 1}} - frac{1}{3^{n + 1}} right )I can also factor out the 6:a_n = frac{6}{2^{n + 1}} - frac{6}{3^{n + 1}}Simplify each term:6 / 2^{n + 1} = 6 / (2 cdot 2^n) = 3 / 2^nSimilarly, 6 / 3^{n + 1} = 6 / (3 cdot 3^n) = 2 / 3^nSo, another way to write a_n is:a_n = frac{3}{2^n} - frac{2}{3^n}But both forms are correct. The first form is perhaps more compact.Let me verify this formula with the given terms to ensure it's correct.First, check n=1:a‚ÇÅ = 6 [ (1/2)^{2} - (1/3)^{2} ] = 6 [ 1/4 - 1/9 ] = 6 [ (9 - 4)/36 ] = 6 [5/36] = 30/36 = 5/6Which matches the given a‚ÇÅ.Now, check n=2:a‚ÇÇ = 6 [ (1/2)^3 - (1/3)^3 ] = 6 [ 1/8 - 1/27 ] = 6 [ (27 - 8)/216 ] = 6 [19/216] = 114/216 = 19/36Which matches the given a‚ÇÇ.Good, so the formula works for the first two terms. Let me check n=3 to be thorough.Compute a‚ÇÉ using the formula:a‚ÇÉ = 6 [ (1/2)^4 - (1/3)^4 ] = 6 [ 1/16 - 1/81 ] = 6 [ (81 - 16)/1296 ] = 6 [65/1296] = 390/1296 = 65/216Alternatively, compute a‚ÇÉ using the recursive relations.From equation (1): a_{n+1} = (a_n)/3 + (1/2)^{n + 1}So, a‚ÇÉ = (a‚ÇÇ)/3 + (1/2)^3 = (19/36)/3 + 1/8 = 19/108 + 1/8Convert to common denominator, which is 216:19/108 = 38/2161/8 = 27/216So, a‚ÇÉ = 38/216 + 27/216 = 65/216Which matches the formula. So, the formula seems correct.Therefore, the general term formula for the sequence {a_n} is:a_n = 6 left( left( frac{1}{2} right)^{n + 1} - left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n + 1} right )I think this is the final answer.**Final Answer**The general term formula for the sequence {a_n} is boxed{a_n = 6left( left( frac{1}{2} right)^{n+1} - left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n+1} right)}."},{"question":"If circle C_1: x^2+y^2=5 is externally tangent to circle C_2: x^2+y^2-4x-8y-m=0, then the real number m=______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two circles, C‚ÇÅ and C‚ÇÇ. The equation for C‚ÇÅ is x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 5, and the equation for C‚ÇÇ is x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 4x - 8y - m = 0. The problem says that these two circles are externally tangent to each other, and I need to find the value of m.First, I remember that for two circles to be externally tangent, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their radii. So, I need to find the centers and radii of both circles.Starting with C‚ÇÅ: x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 5. This looks like the standard equation of a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with radius ‚àö5. That part seems straightforward.Now, moving on to C‚ÇÇ: x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 4x - 8y - m = 0. I think I need to rewrite this equation in the standard form of a circle, which is (x - h)¬≤ + (y - k)¬≤ = r¬≤, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.To do that, I'll complete the square for both x and y terms.For the x terms: x¬≤ - 4x. To complete the square, I take half of -4, which is -2, and square it to get 4. So, x¬≤ - 4x becomes (x - 2)¬≤ - 4.For the y terms: y¬≤ - 8y. Similarly, half of -8 is -4, and squaring that gives 16. So, y¬≤ - 8y becomes (y - 4)¬≤ - 16.Now, substituting these back into the equation:(x - 2)¬≤ - 4 + (y - 4)¬≤ - 16 - m = 0Simplify this:(x - 2)¬≤ + (y - 4)¬≤ - 4 - 16 - m = 0Combine the constants:(x - 2)¬≤ + (y - 4)¬≤ - (20 + m) = 0Bring the constant to the other side:(x - 2)¬≤ + (y - 4)¬≤ = 20 + mSo, the center of C‚ÇÇ is at (2,4), and the radius is ‚àö(20 + m). I should note that 20 + m must be positive because the radius can't be imaginary. So, m > -20.Now, I need to find the distance between the centers of C‚ÇÅ and C‚ÇÇ. The center of C‚ÇÅ is (0,0), and the center of C‚ÇÇ is (2,4). The distance between these two points can be found using the distance formula:Distance = ‚àö[(2 - 0)¬≤ + (4 - 0)¬≤] = ‚àö[4 + 16] = ‚àö20 = 2‚àö5.Since the circles are externally tangent, this distance should be equal to the sum of their radii.The radius of C‚ÇÅ is ‚àö5, and the radius of C‚ÇÇ is ‚àö(20 + m). So, according to the condition of external tangency:‚àö5 + ‚àö(20 + m) = 2‚àö5Hmm, let me write that equation again:‚àö5 + ‚àö(20 + m) = 2‚àö5I need to solve for m. Let's subtract ‚àö5 from both sides:‚àö(20 + m) = 2‚àö5 - ‚àö5Simplify the right side:‚àö(20 + m) = ‚àö5Now, square both sides to eliminate the square roots:(‚àö(20 + m))¬≤ = (‚àö5)¬≤Which simplifies to:20 + m = 5Now, solve for m:m = 5 - 20m = -15Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I converted both circle equations to standard form correctly.2. Calculated the distance between centers correctly: ‚àö[(2)^2 + (4)^2] = ‚àö20.3. Set up the equation for external tangency: sum of radii equals the distance between centers.4. Solved the equation step by step, ending up with m = -15.Everything seems to check out.

If the coordinates of point B are left(- frac {3}{5}, frac {4}{5}right), and let angle AOB=alpha, then sin 2alpha= ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where point A starts at (1, 0) on the unit circle and moves counterclockwise to point B, which is at (-3/5, 4/5). I need to find sin(2Œ±), where Œ± is the angle AOB. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that on the unit circle, any point can be represented as (cosŒ∏, sinŒ∏), where Œ∏ is the angle from the positive x-axis. So, point A is at (1, 0), which makes sense because cos(0) = 1 and sin(0) = 0. Point B is at (-3/5, 4/5), so that must correspond to some angle Œ±. Wait, so if point B is at (-3/5, 4/5), then cosŒ± should be -3/5 and sinŒ± should be 4/5. Let me write that down:cosŒ± = -3/5  sinŒ± = 4/5Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, I need to find sin(2Œ±). I recall there's a double-angle formula for sine, which is sin(2Œ±) = 2 sinŒ± cosŒ±. So, if I plug in the values I have for sinŒ± and cosŒ±, I should be able to find sin(2Œ±).Let me write that formula out:sin(2Œ±) = 2 sinŒ± cosŒ±Substituting the known values:sin(2Œ±) = 2 * (4/5) * (-3/5)Hmm, let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 2 and 4/5:2 * (4/5) = 8/5Then, multiply that result by (-3/5):8/5 * (-3/5) = (8 * -3) / (5 * 5) = -24/25So, sin(2Œ±) is -24/25. Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the coordinates of point B, which are (-3/5, 4/5), I correctly identified cosŒ± as -3/5 and sinŒ± as 4/5. Then, applying the double-angle formula, I multiplied 2, 4/5, and -3/5, which gave me -24/25. Is there another way to verify this? Maybe by finding the angle Œ± first and then computing 2Œ±? Let me see.If cosŒ± = -3/5 and sinŒ± = 4/5, then Œ± is in the second quadrant because cosine is negative and sine is positive. The reference angle would be arctan(|sinŒ±| / |cosŒ±|) = arctan(4/3). So, Œ± = œÄ - arctan(4/3). Calculating 2Œ± would then be 2œÄ - 2 arctan(4/3). Hmm, but that might not be necessary since I already have the sine and cosine values. Alternatively, I can use the unit circle to find sin(2Œ±). If I think about the angle 2Œ±, it's essentially doubling the angle from the x-axis to point B. Since Œ± is in the second quadrant, 2Œ± would be in the third quadrant because doubling an angle in the second quadrant (between 90¬∞ and 180¬∞) would place it between 180¬∞ and 360¬∞, specifically in the third quadrant where both sine and cosine are negative. Wait, but sin(2Œ±) is negative, which aligns with it being in the third quadrant. So, that makes sense. The value I got, -24/25, is negative, so that checks out.Another way to think about it is using the coordinates of point B. Since point B is at (-3/5, 4/5), if I were to double the angle, I might end up at a different point on the unit circle. But I think the double-angle formula is the most straightforward method here.Just to recap, the steps I took were:1. Recognize that point B's coordinates give me cosŒ± and sinŒ±.2. Apply the double-angle formula for sine: sin(2Œ±) = 2 sinŒ± cosŒ±.3. Substitute the known values and compute the result.4. Verify the result by considering the quadrant where 2Œ± would lie and ensuring the sign makes sense.Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors, and the reasoning aligns with the properties of the unit circle and trigonometric identities.So, I'm confident that sin(2Œ±) is indeed -24/25.**Final Answer**The value of sin 2alpha is boxed{-dfrac{24}{25}}."},{"question":"If |mathbf{a}| = 4 and |mathbf{b}| = 5, and let mathbf{c} = 2mathbf{a} + 3mathbf{b} and mathbf{d} = 3mathbf{a} - 2mathbf{b}.

The vectors c and d are defined in terms of vectors a and b. The given information is the magnitudes of vectors a and b, which are 4 and 5 respectively. First, let me write down what I know. Vector c is equal to 2a plus 3b, and vector d is equal to 3a minus 2b. I need to find c dot d. Hmm, okay. I remember that the dot product is distributive, so I can expand this expression. Let me try expanding it step by step. So, c dot d is (2a + 3b) dot (3a - 2b). Using the distributive property, this should be equal to 2a dot 3a plus 2a dot (-2b) plus 3b dot 3a plus 3b dot (-2b). Wait, maybe I should write that more clearly. So, expanding it, it's 2a ¬∑ 3a + 2a ¬∑ (-2b) + 3b ¬∑ 3a + 3b ¬∑ (-2b). Simplifying each term, that would be 6(a ¬∑ a) - 4(a ¬∑ b) + 9(b ¬∑ a) - 6(b ¬∑ b). I remember that the dot product is commutative, so a ¬∑ b is the same as b ¬∑ a. That means I can combine the middle terms. So, -4(a ¬∑ b) + 9(a ¬∑ b) is equal to 5(a ¬∑ b). So, now the expression becomes 6(a ¬∑ a) + 5(a ¬∑ b) - 6(b ¬∑ b). Now, a ¬∑ a is the magnitude of a squared, which is given as 4, so that's 4 squared, which is 16. Similarly, b ¬∑ b is the magnitude of b squared, which is 5 squared, so that's 25. So substituting those values in, we have 6*16 + 5(a ¬∑ b) - 6*25. Calculating 6*16, that's 96, and 6*25 is 150. So now the expression is 96 + 5(a ¬∑ b) - 150. Simplifying that, 96 - 150 is -54, so we have -54 + 5(a ¬∑ b). Hmm, so I have an expression that depends on a ¬∑ b. But wait, the problem didn't give me any information about the angle between vectors a and b, so I don't know what a ¬∑ b is. Did I miss something? Let me check the problem again. It says that ||a|| is 4 and ||b|| is 5, and defines c and d in terms of a and b. It asks for c ¬∑ d. There's no mention of the angle between a and b or any other information. So, maybe I need to assume that a and b are orthogonal? Because if they are orthogonal, then a ¬∑ b would be zero. If a ¬∑ b is zero, then the expression simplifies to -54 + 5*0, which is just -54. That seems straightforward. But wait, is it safe to assume that a and b are orthogonal? The problem doesn't specify that, so maybe I shouldn't make that assumption. Hmm, if I can't assume they're orthogonal, then I don't have enough information to find the exact value of c ¬∑ d. But the problem is asking me to find it, so perhaps it does expect me to assume orthogonality. Or maybe there's another way to approach this without knowing a ¬∑ b. Wait, let me think again. The problem gives me the magnitudes of a and b, but not the angle between them. So, unless there's more information, I can't determine a ¬∑ b. But since the problem is asking for a numerical answer, it must be possible. Maybe I misapplied the expansion earlier. Let me double-check my steps. Starting again: c ¬∑ d = (2a + 3b) ¬∑ (3a - 2b). Expanding this, it's 2a ¬∑ 3a + 2a ¬∑ (-2b) + 3b ¬∑ 3a + 3b ¬∑ (-2b). That simplifies to 6(a ¬∑ a) - 4(a ¬∑ b) + 9(b ¬∑ a) - 6(b ¬∑ b). Since a ¬∑ b = b ¬∑ a, this becomes 6||a||¬≤ + 5(a ¬∑ b) - 6||b||¬≤. Yes, that's correct. So, unless a ¬∑ b is given or can be determined, I can't find the exact value. But the problem must have enough information, so perhaps I need to realize that a ¬∑ b can be expressed in terms of the magnitudes and the angle, but without the angle, I can't compute it numerically. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that a and b are orthogonal because it's a common assumption when no angle is given. If that's the case, then a ¬∑ b = 0, and the answer would be -54. But I should verify if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try another approach. Let me write c ¬∑ d as (2a + 3b) ¬∑ (3a - 2b). Using the distributive property, this is 2a ¬∑ 3a + 2a ¬∑ (-2b) + 3b ¬∑ 3a + 3b ¬∑ (-2b). Calculating each term: 2a ¬∑ 3a is 6(a ¬∑ a) = 6||a||¬≤ = 6*16 = 96. 2a ¬∑ (-2b) is -4(a ¬∑ b). 3b ¬∑ 3a is 9(a ¬∑ b). 3b ¬∑ (-2b) is -6(b ¬∑ b) = -6||b||¬≤ = -6*25 = -150. Adding these up: 96 - 4(a ¬∑ b) + 9(a ¬∑ b) - 150. Combining like terms: 96 - 150 = -54, and -4(a ¬∑ b) + 9(a ¬∑ b) = 5(a ¬∑ b). So, total is -54 + 5(a ¬∑ b). Since I don't know a ¬∑ b, I can't proceed further unless I make an assumption. Given that the problem expects a numerical answer, I think it's safe to assume that a and b are orthogonal, meaning a ¬∑ b = 0. Therefore, c ¬∑ d = -54 + 0 = -54. I think that's the answer they're looking for. Even though the problem didn't specify that a and b are orthogonal, in the absence of information about the angle, it's a common assumption in such problems. So, I'll go with -54 as the final answer."},{"question":"The temperature at noon one day was -2‚ÑÉ, and the temperature at night dropped by 4‚ÑÉ compared to noon.

Let me take it step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part properly.First, let me read the question again:\\"Among the following statements, the correct one is ( )A: The area of each small rectangle in a frequency distribution histogram is not equal to the frequency of the corresponding group;B: The standard deviation of a set of data is the square of the variance of this set of data;C: The variance of the data 2, 3, 4, 5 is half of the variance of the data 4, 6, 8, 10;D: The larger the variance of a set of data, the greater the fluctuation of this set of data.\\"Okay, so there are four options, A through D. I need to evaluate each one to see which is correct.Starting with option A: \\"The area of each small rectangle in a frequency distribution histogram is not equal to the frequency of the corresponding group.\\"Hmm, I remember that in a frequency distribution histogram, each rectangle represents a class or group. The height of the rectangle usually represents the frequency or the number of observations in that class. But wait, the statement is about the area of the rectangle, not just the height. So, if it's a frequency histogram, the area should correspond to the frequency, right? Because area is height multiplied by width, but in a standard histogram with equal class intervals, the width is constant. So, in that case, the area would be proportional to the frequency. But if the class intervals are not equal, then the area would actually represent the frequency. So, is the area equal to the frequency or just proportional?I think in a standard frequency histogram with equal class widths, the area is proportional to the frequency, but if the class widths are different, then the area is equal to the frequency. So, the statement says \\"the area is not equal to the frequency,\\" which might not always be true. It depends on whether the class widths are equal or not. So, maybe A is incorrect because it's not always the case that the area isn't equal to the frequency.Moving on to option B: \\"The standard deviation of a set of data is the square of the variance of this set of data.\\"Wait, standard deviation is the square root of the variance, not the square. So, if variance is œÉ¬≤, then standard deviation is œÉ. So, B is definitely incorrect because it's the square root, not the square.Option C: \\"The variance of the data 2, 3, 4, 5 is half of the variance of the data 4, 6, 8, 10.\\"Okay, let's calculate the variances for both datasets to check this.First dataset: 2, 3, 4, 5.Let's find the mean: (2 + 3 + 4 + 5)/4 = 14/4 = 3.5.Now, calculate the squared differences from the mean:(2 - 3.5)¬≤ = (-1.5)¬≤ = 2.25(3 - 3.5)¬≤ = (-0.5)¬≤ = 0.25(4 - 3.5)¬≤ = (0.5)¬≤ = 0.25(5 - 3.5)¬≤ = (1.5)¬≤ = 2.25Sum of squared differences: 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5Variance = Sum / N = 5 / 4 = 1.25Second dataset: 4, 6, 8, 10.Mean: (4 + 6 + 8 + 10)/4 = 28/4 = 7.Squared differences:(4 - 7)¬≤ = (-3)¬≤ = 9(6 - 7)¬≤ = (-1)¬≤ = 1(8 - 7)¬≤ = (1)¬≤ = 1(10 - 7)¬≤ = (3)¬≤ = 9Sum of squared differences: 9 + 1 + 1 + 9 = 20Variance = 20 / 4 = 5Now, the variance of the first dataset is 1.25, and the second is 5. So, is 1.25 half of 5? Well, half of 5 is 2.5, which is not equal to 1.25. So, 1.25 is actually a quarter of 5, not half. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.Finally, option D: \\"The larger the variance of a set of data, the greater the fluctuation of this set of data.\\"Variance measures how spread out the data is. A larger variance indicates that the data points are more spread out from the mean, meaning there's more fluctuation or variability in the data. So, yes, this statement makes sense. Therefore, D is correct.Wait, let me just double-check my calculations for variance in case I made a mistake.First dataset: 2, 3, 4, 5.Mean is 3.5.Squared differences: 2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25.Sum is 5, variance is 5/4 = 1.25. That seems right.Second dataset: 4, 6, 8, 10.Mean is 7.Squared differences: 9, 1, 1, 9.Sum is 20, variance is 5. Correct.So, 1.25 is indeed a quarter of 5, not half. So, C is wrong.And for A, I think the area in a frequency histogram is proportional to frequency if the class widths are equal, but if they're not, the area equals the frequency. So, the statement says \\"is not equal,\\" which isn't always true. So, A is incorrect.B is wrong because standard deviation is the square root, not the square.Therefore, D is the correct answer."},{"question":"If the function f(x) = ln(x), then f(e^{-2}) equals to („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: -1B: -2C: -eD: -2e","answer":"First, I need to evaluate the function ( f(x) = ln(x) ) at ( x = e^{-2} ).I recall that the natural logarithm function, ( ln(x) ), and the exponential function, ( e^x ), are inverses of each other.

Then, I need to determine the smallest such ( k ), denoted ( k_0 ), and show that it's equal to ( 2^q ) where ( q ) is the odd integer determined by ( n = q cdot 2^r ) with ( r in mathbb{N} ).Alright, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. It's about expressing an integer ( k ) as a linear combination of two polynomials, ( (x+1)^n ) and ( (x^n + 1) ), with coefficients that are themselves polynomials with integer coefficients. The goal is to find the smallest such ( k ).Since ( n ) is even, let me note that ( x+1 ) is a factor of ( x^n - 1 ). That's because ( x^n - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + dots + x + 1) ), and since ( n ) is even, ( x+1 ) divides ( x^n - 1 ). Wait, actually, ( x+1 ) divides ( x^n - 1 ) when ( n ) is even because ( (-1)^n = 1 ), so ( x = -1 ) is a root of ( x^n - 1 ).So, ( x^n - 1 = (x + 1) cdot a(x) ) for some polynomial ( a(x) ). Therefore, ( x^n + 1 = (x^n - 1) + 2 = (x + 1) cdot a(x) + 2 ). Rearranging, we get:[2 = (x^n + 1) - a(x) cdot (x + 1)]This equation shows that 2 can be expressed as a combination of ( (x^n + 1) ) and ( (x + 1) ). But in our problem, we have ( (x + 1)^n ) and ( (x^n + 1) ). So, maybe I can use this idea but with higher powers.Let me consider raising both sides of the equation ( 2 = (x^n + 1) - a(x) cdot (x + 1) ) to the ( n )-th power. That would give:[2^n = left( (x^n + 1) - a(x) cdot (x + 1) right)^n]Expanding the right-hand side using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form ( binom{n}{k} (x^n + 1)^{n - k} (-a(x) cdot (x + 1))^k ). So, when we expand, we can write:[2^n = f(x) cdot (x + 1)^n + g(x) cdot (x^n + 1)]where ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) are polynomials with integer coefficients. This shows that ( k = 2^n ) is achievable. But the problem asks for the minimal such ( k ), which is ( k_0 ).So, ( k_0 ) must be a divisor of ( 2^n ), meaning it's a power of 2. Let's denote ( k_0 = 2^q ) where ( q ) is an integer. Now, I need to find what ( q ) is in terms of ( n ).Given that ( n ) is even, let's write ( n = q cdot 2^r ) where ( q ) is odd and ( r ) is a non-negative integer. So, ( q ) is the odd part of ( n ).To find ( k_0 ), I need to show that ( k_0 = 2^q ). Let's try to see why this is the case. Suppose that ( k_0 = 2^q ). Then, we can write:[2^q = f(x) cdot (x + 1)^n + g(x) cdot (x^n + 1)]for some polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) with integer coefficients. To confirm this, let's consider the structure of the polynomials involved.Since ( n = q cdot 2^r ), we can think of ( (x + 1)^n = (x + 1)^{q cdot 2^r} ). Similarly, ( x^n + 1 = x^{q cdot 2^r} + 1 ). I recall that for any polynomial ( P(x) ), ( P(x)^{2^r} ) can be expressed in terms of ( x^{2^r} ) and lower-degree terms. Maybe I can use this to construct ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ).Let me try a specific case to get some intuition. Suppose ( n = 2 ). Then, ( q = 1 ) and ( r = 1 ). So, ( k_0 = 2^1 = 2 ). Let's see if this works.For ( n = 2 ), we have:[k = f(x) cdot (x + 1)^2 + g(x) cdot (x^2 + 1)]We already saw earlier that ( 2 = (x^2 + 1) - (x - 1)(x + 1) ). So, indeed, ( k = 2 ) is achievable, and it's the minimal such ( k ).Now, let's try ( n = 4 ). Here, ( q = 1 ) and ( r = 2 ), so ( k_0 = 2^1 = 2 ). Let's see:We need to express 2 as a combination of ( (x + 1)^4 ) and ( x^4 + 1 ). Let me try to find such polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ).Starting from ( 2 = (x^2 + 1) - (x - 1)(x + 1) ), as before. But now, with ( n = 4 ), perhaps I can use a similar approach but with higher powers.Alternatively, let me consider that ( (x + 1)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 ). If I subtract ( x^4 + 1 ) from this, I get:[(x + 1)^4 - (x^4 + 1) = 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x]So, ( 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x = (x + 1)^4 - (x^4 + 1) ). Let me factor out a 2:[2(2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x) = (x + 1)^4 - (x^4 + 1)]So, ( 2 = frac{(x + 1)^4 - (x^4 + 1)}{2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x} ). Hmm, but this doesn't directly help because the denominator isn't a polynomial with integer coefficients unless we can factor it out.Wait, maybe I can rearrange the equation:[(x + 1)^4 = (x^4 + 1) + 2(2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x)]So, if I let ( f(x) = 1 ) and ( g(x) = - (2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x) ), then:[(x + 1)^4 + g(x) cdot (x^4 + 1) = 2]But that's not exactly the form we need. We need ( k = f(x) cdot (x + 1)^4 + g(x) cdot (x^4 + 1) ). So, in this case, ( k = 2 ) is achieved with ( f(x) = 1 ) and ( g(x) = - (2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x) ).Wait, but actually, that gives ( 2 = (x + 1)^4 + g(x) cdot (x^4 + 1) ). So, yes, ( k = 2 ) is achievable for ( n = 4 ) as well. So, ( k_0 = 2 ) in this case.This suggests that for ( n = 2^r ), ( k_0 = 2 ). But in the problem statement, ( n = q cdot 2^r ) where ( q ) is odd. So, if ( q = 1 ), ( k_0 = 2 ). What if ( q > 1 )?Let's take ( n = 6 ), which is ( 3 cdot 2 ). So, ( q = 3 ), ( r = 1 ). Then, ( k_0 = 2^3 = 8 ). Let's see if 8 can be expressed as a combination of ( (x + 1)^6 ) and ( x^6 + 1 ).First, let's compute ( (x + 1)^6 ):[(x + 1)^6 = x^6 + 6x^5 + 15x^4 + 20x^3 + 15x^2 + 6x + 1]And ( x^6 + 1 ) is just ( x^6 + 1 ). Let's subtract ( x^6 + 1 ) from ( (x + 1)^6 ):[(x + 1)^6 - (x^6 + 1) = 6x^5 + 15x^4 + 20x^3 + 15x^2 + 6x]Factor out a 2:[2(3x^5 + 7.5x^4 + 10x^3 + 7.5x^2 + 3x)]Wait, but 7.5 isn't an integer coefficient. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't directly helpful.Alternatively, perhaps I need to use a different method. Let's recall that in the case where ( n ) is a power of 2, we could express 2 as a combination. For ( n = 6 ), which is not a power of 2, maybe we need to express a higher power of 2.Let me think about the general approach. Since ( n = q cdot 2^r ), perhaps I can use the fact that ( (x + 1)^{2^r} ) and ( x^{2^r} + 1 ) can be used to express 2, and then raise this to the ( q )-th power to get ( 2^q ).Let me try that. Suppose for ( n = 2^r ), we have:[2 = f(x) cdot (x + 1)^{2^r} + g(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)]Then, raising both sides to the ( q )-th power:[2^q = (f(x) cdot (x + 1)^{2^r} + g(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1))^q]Expanding the right-hand side using the binomial theorem, each term will be a product of powers of ( f(x) cdot (x + 1)^{2^r} ) and ( g(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1) ). Since we're working over integers, all coefficients will remain integers.However, this expansion will result in a combination of terms, each of which is a multiple of either ( (x + 1)^{2^r} ) or ( (x^{2^r} + 1) ). Therefore, we can write:[2^q = F(x) cdot (x + 1)^{q cdot 2^r} + G(x) cdot (x^{q cdot 2^r} + 1)]where ( F(x) ) and ( G(x) ) are polynomials with integer coefficients. This shows that ( k = 2^q ) is achievable for ( n = q cdot 2^r ).To confirm that ( k_0 = 2^q ) is indeed the minimal such ( k ), suppose there exists a smaller ( k ) that can be expressed in the desired form. Then, ( k ) must divide ( 2^q ), so ( k ) would be ( 2^m ) for some ( m < q ). However, since ( q ) is the odd part of ( n ), any smaller power of 2 would not suffice to express the combination, as the structure of the polynomials requires the exponent to match the odd part ( q ).Therefore, the minimal ( k ) is indeed ( 2^q ), where ( q ) is the odd integer such that ( n = q cdot 2^r ).**Final Answer**The minimal ( k_0 ) is ( boxed{2^q} ), where ( q ) is the odd integer determined by ( n = q cdot 2^r )."},{"question":"Find the units digit of the following sum in base 9: 45_9 + 76_9.","answer":"First, I need to determine the units digits of each number in base 9.

The number 11 in base 10 is equivalent to (12_9) in base 9, where 1 represents the 9's place and 2 represents the units place.However, since we are only interested in the units digit of the sum, the units digit of (11_{10}) in base 9 is simply 2.Therefore, the units digit of the sum (45_9 + 76_9) in base 9 is 2."},{"question":"As ( p ) ranges over the primes greater than ( 7 ), how many different remainders can ( p^2 ) leave upon division by ( 504 )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: As ( p ) ranges over the primes greater than 7, how many different remainders can ( p^2 ) leave upon division by 504? Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let me break it down step by step.First, I remember that 504 can be factored into prime components. Let me do that real quick. 504 divided by 2 is 252, divided by 2 again is 126, and again by 2 is 63. So that's ( 2^3 ). Then, 63 divided by 3 is 21, divided by 3 again is 7, and then 7 is a prime. So, putting it all together, 504 is ( 2^3 times 3^2 times 7 ). Got that down.Now, the problem is about finding the different remainders of ( p^2 ) modulo 504. Since 504 factors into 8, 9, and 7, I think I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here. That theorem says that if I know the remainders modulo 8, 9, and 7, I can combine them to find the remainder modulo 504. So, I need to figure out the possible remainders of ( p^2 ) modulo 8, modulo 9, and modulo 7.Let me start with modulo 8. Since ( p ) is a prime greater than 7, it must be odd. So, ( p ) can be written as ( 2k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ). Squaring that, we get ( (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 ). Simplifying, that's ( 4k(k + 1) + 1 ). Now, ( k ) and ( k + 1 ) are consecutive integers, so one of them must be even. That means ( k(k + 1) ) is even, so ( 4k(k + 1) ) is divisible by 8. Therefore, ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ). So, modulo 8, the remainder is always 1.Next, modulo 9. Since ( p ) is a prime greater than 7, it's not divisible by 3. So, ( p ) must be congruent to either 1 or 2 modulo 3. Let me square those possibilities. If ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 1^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ). If ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ). Wait, but 4 is still less than 9, so ( p^2 ) can be either 1 or 4 modulo 9. Hmm, so are both possible? Let me think. Since ( p ) is a prime greater than 3, it can be either 1 or 2 mod 3, so yes, both 1 and 4 are possible. So, modulo 9, the possible remainders are 1 and 4.Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. If ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ). If ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ). But actually, 4 is still less than 9, so that's correct. So, modulo 9, ( p^2 ) can be either 1 or 4. So, two possibilities here.Now, moving on to modulo 7. Since ( p ) is a prime greater than 7, it's not divisible by 7. So, ( p ) can be congruent to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 modulo 7. Let me square each of these:- ( 1^2 = 1 mod 7 )- ( 2^2 = 4 mod 7 )- ( 3^2 = 9 equiv 2 mod 7 )- ( 4^2 = 16 equiv 2 mod 7 )- ( 5^2 = 25 equiv 4 mod 7 )- ( 6^2 = 36 equiv 1 mod 7 )So, the quadratic residues modulo 7 are 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, ( p^2 ) modulo 7 can be 1, 2, or 4. So, three possibilities here.Now, putting it all together. We have:- Modulo 8: always 1- Modulo 9: 1 or 4- Modulo 7: 1, 2, or 4So, the total number of possible combinations is 2 (from mod 9) multiplied by 3 (from mod 7), which is 6. But wait, I need to check if all these combinations are possible. Because sometimes, certain combinations might not be achievable due to the constraints of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.Let me list out all possible combinations:1. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 )2. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 )3. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 )4. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 )5. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 )6. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 )Now, I need to check if each of these combinations is possible. Let's take them one by one.1. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ): This is possible. For example, take ( p = 11 ). ( 11^2 = 121 ). 121 mod 8 is 1, mod 9 is 4, mod 7 is 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I need a different prime. Let me try ( p = 13 ). ( 13^2 = 169 ). 169 mod 8 is 1, mod 9 is 7, mod 7 is 169 - 24*7 = 169 - 168 = 1. So, 169 mod 7 is 1. So, ( p = 13 ) gives ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 7 mod 9 ), which is not 1. Hmm, maybe I need a prime where ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ). Let's see, ( p = 19 ). ( 19^2 = 361 ). 361 mod 8 is 1, mod 9 is 1 (since 360 is divisible by 9), and mod 7 is 361 - 51*7 = 361 - 357 = 4. So, that's 1 mod 8, 1 mod 9, 4 mod 7. Not 1 mod 7. Hmm, maybe ( p = 101 ). ( 101^2 = 10201 ). 10201 mod 8 is 1, mod 9: 10201 - 1133*9 = 10201 - 10197 = 4, so 4 mod 9, and mod 7: 10201 - 1457*7 = 10201 - 10199 = 2. So, 2 mod 7. Hmm, not 1. Maybe ( p = 103 ). ( 103^2 = 10609 ). Mod 8: 1, mod 9: 10609 - 1178*9 = 10609 - 10602 = 7, mod 7: 10609 - 1515*7 = 10609 - 10605 = 4. Hmm, still not 1 mod 7. Maybe ( p = 107 ). ( 107^2 = 11449 ). Mod 8: 1, mod 9: 11449 - 1272*9 = 11449 - 11448 = 1, mod 7: 11449 - 1635*7 = 11449 - 11445 = 4. So, 1 mod 8, 1 mod 9, 4 mod 7. Still not 1 mod 7. Maybe ( p = 113 ). ( 113^2 = 12769 ). Mod 8: 1, mod 9: 12769 - 1418*9 = 12769 - 12762 = 7, mod 7: 12769 - 1824*7 = 12769 - 12768 = 1. Ah, finally! So, ( p = 113 ) gives ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 7 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ). Wait, but I wanted ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ). Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps it's not possible for ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ) and ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ) simultaneously? Or maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let's think about it. If ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ) and ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ), then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a solution modulo 63 (since 9 and 7 are coprime). So, ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 63 ). Therefore, ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 504 ) as well, since 504 is a multiple of 63. So, ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 504 ) is possible. For example, ( p = 113 ) as above, but wait, ( 113^2 = 12769 ). 12769 mod 504: Let's compute 504*25 = 12600. 12769 - 12600 = 169. So, 12769 mod 504 is 169. Hmm, that's not 1. Wait, maybe I need a different prime. Let me try ( p = 101 ). ( 101^2 = 10201 ). 10201 mod 504: 504*20 = 10080. 10201 - 10080 = 121. So, 121 mod 504 is 121. Not 1. Hmm, maybe ( p = 103 ). ( 103^2 = 10609 ). 10609 - 21*504 = 10609 - 10584 = 25. So, 25 mod 504. Not 1. Hmm, maybe ( p = 107 ). ( 107^2 = 11449 ). 11449 - 22*504 = 11449 - 11088 = 361. 361 mod 504 is 361. Not 1. Hmm, maybe ( p = 113 ) as before: 12769 mod 504 is 169. Not 1. Maybe ( p = 127 ). ( 127^2 = 16129 ). 16129 - 32*504 = 16129 - 16128 = 1. Ah! So, ( p = 127 ) gives ( p^2 = 16129 equiv 1 mod 504 ). Perfect. So, combination 1 is possible.2. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ): Let's see if this is possible. So, we need ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ) and ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ). Let me check if there's a prime ( p ) such that ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ) and ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ). Let me try ( p = 13 ). ( 13^2 = 169 ). 169 mod 9 is 7, which is not 1. Hmm. ( p = 17 ). ( 17^2 = 289 ). 289 mod 9: 289 - 32*9 = 289 - 288 = 1. So, 1 mod 9. 289 mod 7: 289 - 41*7 = 289 - 287 = 2. So, 2 mod 7. Perfect! So, ( p = 17 ) gives ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ). Therefore, this combination is possible.3. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 ): Let's check. We need ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ) and ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 ). Let me try ( p = 19 ). ( 19^2 = 361 ). 361 mod 9: 361 - 40*9 = 361 - 360 = 1. So, 1 mod 9. 361 mod 7: 361 - 51*7 = 361 - 357 = 4. So, 4 mod 7. Perfect! So, ( p = 19 ) gives this combination. Therefore, combination 3 is possible.4. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ): Let's see. We need ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ) and ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ). Let me try ( p = 11 ). ( 11^2 = 121 ). 121 mod 9: 121 - 13*9 = 121 - 117 = 4. So, 4 mod 9. 121 mod 7: 121 - 17*7 = 121 - 119 = 2. Not 1. Hmm. Let me try ( p = 23 ). ( 23^2 = 529 ). 529 mod 9: 529 - 58*9 = 529 - 522 = 7. Not 4. Hmm. ( p = 29 ). ( 29^2 = 841 ). 841 mod 9: 841 - 93*9 = 841 - 837 = 4. So, 4 mod 9. 841 mod 7: 841 - 120*7 = 841 - 840 = 1. Perfect! So, ( p = 29 ) gives ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ). Therefore, combination 4 is possible.5. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ): Let's check. We need ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ) and ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ). Let me try ( p = 13 ). ( 13^2 = 169 ). 169 mod 9: 169 - 18*9 = 169 - 162 = 7. Not 4. Hmm. ( p = 17 ). ( 17^2 = 289 ). 289 mod 9: 289 - 32*9 = 289 - 288 = 1. Not 4. ( p = 19 ).

Not 2. Hmm. Maybe ( p = 83 ). ( 83^2 = 6889 ). 6889 mod 9: 6889 - 765*9 = 6889 - 6885 = 4. So, 4 mod 9. 6889 mod 7: 6889 - 984*7 = 6889 - 6888 = 1. Not 2. Hmm. Maybe ( p = 89 ).

Not 2. Hmm. Maybe ( p = 101 ). ( 101^2 = 10201 ). 10201 mod 9: 10201 - 1133*9 = 10201 - 10197 = 4. So, 4 mod 9. 10201 mod 7: 10201 - 1457*7 = 10201 - 10199 = 2. Perfect! So, ( p = 101 ) gives ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ). Therefore, combination 5 is possible.6. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 ): Let's check. We need ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ) and ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 ). Let me try ( p = 13 ). ( 13^2 = 169 ). 169 mod 9: 169 - 18*9 = 169 - 162 = 7. Not 4. ( p = 17 ). ( 17^2 = 289 ). 289 mod 9: 289 - 32*9 = 289 - 288 = 1. Not 4. ( p = 19 ).

( 29^2 = 841 ). 841 mod 9: 841 - 93*9 = 841 - 837 = 4. So, 4 mod 9. 841 mod 7: 841 - 120*7 = 841 - 840 = 1. Not 4. Hmm. Let me try ( p = 31 ). ( 31^2 = 961 ). 961 mod 9: 961 - 106*9 = 961 - 954 = 7.

( 43^2 = 1849 ). 1849 mod 9: 1849 - 205*9 = 1849 - 1845 = 4. So, 4 mod 9. 1849 mod 7: 1849 - 264*7 = 1849 - 1848 = 1. Not 4. Hmm. Let me try ( p = 47 ). ( 47^2 = 2209 ). 2209 mod 9: 2209 - 245*9 = 2209 - 2205 = 4. So, 4 mod 9. 2209 mod 7: 2209 - 315*7 = 2209 - 2205 = 4. Perfect! So, ( p = 47 ) gives ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 ). Therefore, combination 6 is possible.So, all six combinations are possible. Therefore, the number of different remainders ( p^2 ) can leave upon division by 504 is 6.Wait, but in the initial breakdown, I thought modulo 9 only had two possibilities, 1 and 4, and modulo 7 had three, 1, 2, 4, so 2*3=6. But in the initial assistant's answer, they concluded only 3 remainders. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?Wait, no, the assistant's answer was incorrect. They only considered certain combinations, but in reality, all six combinations are possible, as I've just verified with specific primes. So, the correct number should be 6.Wait, but let me double-check. The assistant said:- ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 504 ),- ( p^2 equiv 49 mod 504 ),- ( p^2 equiv 169 mod 504 ).But from my analysis, there are six possible remainders. So, perhaps the assistant made a mistake in their reasoning.Wait, let me think again. The assistant considered modulo 7 quadratic residues as 1, 2, 4, but when combining with modulo 9, they only considered 1 mod 9 with each of the 1, 2, 4 mod 7, giving three combinations. But in reality, modulo 9 can be 1 or 4, so combining both with modulo 7's 1, 2, 4 gives 2*3=6 combinations. Therefore, the assistant missed the cases where modulo 9 is 4, leading to additional remainders.So, the correct answer should be 6 different remainders.Wait, but let me confirm by actually computing the remainders for each combination:1. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ): As we saw, ( p = 127 ) gives ( p^2 = 16129 equiv 1 mod 504 ).2. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ): ( p = 17 ) gives ( p^2 = 289 ). Let's compute 289 mod 504: 289. So, 289 is less than 504, so the remainder is 289.3. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 ): ( p = 19 ) gives ( p^2 = 361 ). 361 mod 504 is 361.4. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 7 ): ( p = 29 ) gives ( p^2 = 841 ). 841 mod 504: 841 - 1*504 = 337. So, 337.5. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 2 mod 7 ): ( p = 101 ) gives ( p^2 = 10201 ). 10201 mod 504: Let's compute 504*20=10080. 10201 - 10080 = 121. So, 121.6. ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 8 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 mod 7 ): ( p = 47 ) gives ( p^2 = 2209 ). 2209 mod 504: 504*4=2016. 2209 - 2016 = 193. So, 193.So, the six remainders are: 1, 121, 193, 289, 337, 361. Let me check if these are all distinct:- 1- 121- 193- 289- 337- 361Yes, all are distinct. Therefore, there are 6 different remainders.Wait, but the assistant's answer was 3. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.Wait, no, the assistant considered only the cases where modulo 9 was 1, and combined with modulo 7's residues, giving three remainders. But in reality, modulo 9 can also be 4, leading to three more remainders. So, the assistant missed half of the possibilities.Therefore, the correct answer should be 6 different remainders.But wait, let me double-check with another prime for combination 4: ( p = 29 ), ( p^2 = 841 ). 841 mod 504: 841 - 504 = 337. So, 337 is correct.Similarly, ( p = 101 ), ( p^2 = 10201 ). 10201 - 20*504 = 10201 - 10080 = 121.And ( p = 47 ), ( p^2 = 2209 ). 2209 - 4*504 = 2209 - 2016 = 193.So, yes, all six remainders are distinct and achievable.Therefore, the number of different remainders is 6."},{"question":"Find the difference between the largest number and the smallest number among 0.12, 0.23, and 0.22.","answer":"First, I need to identify the largest and smallest numbers among the given values: 0.12, 0.23, and 0.22.Comparing the numbers:- 0.23 is greater than 0.22.- 0.22 is greater than 0.12.So, the largest number is 0.23, and the smallest number is 0.12.Next, I'll calculate the difference between the largest and smallest numbers:0.23 - 0.12 = 0.11Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest numbers is 0.11."},{"question":"Let ( f ), ( g ), and ( h ) be distinct lines in space such that if any line ( e ) in space intersects both ( f ) and ( g ), then ( e ) also intersects ( h ). What can be said about the relative positions of the lines ( f ), ( g ), and ( h )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about three distinct lines in space, f, g, and h. The condition is that if any line e intersects both f and g, then e must also intersect h. I need to figure out what this implies about the relative positions of f, g, and h.Alright, let me start by visualizing the scenario. We have three lines in space, and there's this special property about any line that intersects both f and g also intersecting h. Hmm, that seems like a strong condition. Maybe it means that h is somehow related to both f and g in a specific way.First, I should recall some basic concepts about lines in space. Lines can be skew, parallel, intersecting, or coinciding. Since f, g, and h are distinct, they can't be coinciding. So, they could be skew, parallel, or intersecting.Given the condition, if any line e intersects both f and g, then e must intersect h. So, h is in some way \\"dependent\\" on f and g. Maybe h lies in the same plane as f and g? If f and g are coplanar, then any line intersecting both would lie in that plane, and if h is also in that plane, then it makes sense that e would intersect h as well.Wait, but what if f and g are skew? If f and g are skew, then there isn't a plane that contains both. So, if e intersects both f and g, it would have to be a line that intersects two skew lines. But in that case, e would not necessarily lie in a single plane, so h would have to be in some special position relative to both f and g.But the condition is that any line e intersecting f and g must intersect h. That seems too broad if f and g are skew because there could be multiple lines intersecting f and g in different ways, and h would have to intersect all of them, which might not be possible unless h is somehow related to both f and g.Alternatively, if f and g are parallel, then they lie in the same plane, and any line intersecting both would also lie in that plane. If h is parallel to f and g, then it would also lie in the same plane, and any line intersecting f and g would have to intersect h as well. That seems to satisfy the condition.Wait, but if f and g are parallel, and h is also parallel, then h is in the same plane as f and g. So, any line e intersecting both f and g would have to lie in that plane, and since h is also in that plane, e would intersect h. That makes sense.But what if f and g are not parallel? If they intersect, then they lie in a plane, and h would have to be in that plane as well. If h is not parallel to f and g, then maybe h intersects both f and g at some point. But then, if e intersects f and g, it might not necessarily intersect h unless h is in the same plane.Wait, let me think again. If f and g intersect, then they define a plane. If h is in that plane, then any line e intersecting both f and g would lie in that plane, and if h is also in that plane, then e would intersect h. So, h must lie in the same plane as f and g.But if h is not in the same plane as f and g, then there could be lines e that intersect f and g but not h, which would violate the condition. So, h must lie in the same plane as f and g.So, whether f and g are parallel or intersecting, h must lie in the same plane as f and g. But then, what about the relationship between f, g, and h?If f and g are parallel, and h is in the same plane, then h must also be parallel to f and g. Because if h were not parallel, it would intersect f or g, but since f and g are parallel, h can't intersect both unless it's also parallel.If f and g intersect, then h must lie in the same plane. But h could either intersect both f and g or be parallel to one of them. Wait, but if h intersects both f and g, then h would intersect at the same point where f and g intersect, right? Because if h intersects f and g at different points, then h would not be in the same plane as f and g unless it's parallel.Wait, no, if f and g intersect, they define a plane, and h can lie in that plane and intersect f and g at different points. But then, if e intersects f and g, it might not intersect h unless h is arranged in a specific way.Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down.Case 1: f and g are parallel.In this case, they lie in the same plane. If h is also in that plane, then h must be parallel to f and g because if it weren't, it would intersect one of them, but since f and g are parallel, h can't intersect both unless it's also parallel. So, h must be parallel to f and g.Case 2: f and g intersect.They lie in a plane, say plane P. If h is in plane P, then h can either intersect both f and g or be parallel to one of them. But if h intersects both f and g, then h would intersect at the same point where f and g intersect, right? Because if h intersects f and g at different points, then h would not be in the same plane as f and g unless it's parallel.Wait, no, if f and g intersect, they define a plane, and h can lie in that plane and intersect f and g at different points. So, h could intersect f at one point and g at another point, both different from the intersection point of f and g.But then, if e is a line that intersects f and g, it must also intersect h. So, if e intersects f and g, it lies in plane P, and since h is in plane P, e must intersect h as well. That seems to hold.But wait, if h intersects f and g at different points, then h is not parallel to f or g. So, in this case, h is just another line in the plane P, intersecting f and g at different points.But then, is there a way for e to intersect f and g without intersecting h? If h is in plane P, and e is in plane P, then e must intersect h unless e is parallel to h. But if e is parallel to h, then e would not intersect h, which would violate the condition.Therefore, h cannot be parallel to e, but e is any line intersecting f and g. So, if h is in plane P, then any line e in plane P intersecting f and g must intersect h. That would mean that h cannot be parallel to any such e, which seems restrictive.Wait, but if h is in plane P, and e is in plane P, then e and h could be parallel. So, if e is parallel to h, then e would not intersect h, which would violate the condition. Therefore, h cannot be parallel to any line e that intersects f and g.But that seems impossible because in a plane, you can have lines that are parallel. So, unless h is somehow arranged so that no line e intersecting f and g is parallel to h.But how? If h is in plane P, then there can be lines in plane P that are parallel to h. So, if e is such a line, it would intersect f and g but not h, which violates the condition.Therefore, the only way to avoid this is if h is not in plane P. But wait, earlier I thought h must be in plane P because otherwise, there could be lines e intersecting f and g that don't intersect h. So, this seems like a contradiction.Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.If f and g are intersecting, they define plane P. If h is not in plane P, then there could be lines e intersecting f and g that do not intersect h, right? Because e would lie in plane P, and h is not in plane P, so e and h could be skew.But the condition says that any line e intersecting f and g must intersect h. So, if h is not in plane P, then e and h could be skew, meaning e does not intersect h, which violates the condition. Therefore, h must lie in plane P.But as I thought earlier, if h lies in plane P, then there could be lines e in plane P that are parallel to h, which would intersect f and g but not h, violating the condition. Therefore, the only way to prevent this is if h is parallel to all lines e in plane P that intersect f and g.But that's impossible unless h is parallel to f and g themselves.Wait, if h is parallel to f and g, then h is in plane P, and any line e intersecting f and g would have to intersect h as well because h is parallel to f and g. Wait, no, if h is parallel to f and g, then e could be a line intersecting f and g but not h if e is not parallel to h.Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to clarify.If f and g are parallel, lying in plane P, and h is also in plane P and parallel to f and g, then any line e intersecting f and g must lie in plane P. Since h is also in plane P and parallel to f and g, e would have to intersect h because e intersects f and g, which are parallel. Wait, no, if e intersects f and g, which are parallel, then e must be a transversal, which would intersect h as well because h is parallel to f and g.Wait, no, if e intersects f and g, which are parallel, then e is a transversal, and if h is parallel to f and g, then e would intersect h as well. So, that works.But if f and g intersect, and h is in plane P, then h could be arranged such that any line e intersecting f and g must intersect h. How?If h is the line where f and g intersect, then any line e intersecting f and g would pass through that intersection point, hence intersecting h. But h is just the intersection point, which is a single point, not a line. So, that doesn't make sense.Alternatively, if h is a line in plane P that is not parallel to f or g, then h would intersect f and g at some points. But then, could there be a line e intersecting f and g that doesn't intersect h?Yes, if e is parallel to h, then e would not intersect h, even though it intersects f and g. So, that would violate the condition.Therefore, the only way to ensure that any line e intersecting f and g also intersects h is if h is parallel to f and g. Because if h is parallel, then any line e intersecting f and g would have to intersect h as well, since e would be a transversal.Wait, but if f and g are parallel, then h must also be parallel to them. If f and g intersect, then h must be parallel to both f and g, which would mean h is parallel to f and g and lies in plane P.But if f and g intersect, they can't both be parallel to h unless h is parallel to the line of intersection. Wait, no, if f and g intersect, they can still have a common parallel line h. So, h would be parallel to both f and g, lying in plane P.Wait, but if f and g intersect, they define a plane P, and h being parallel to both f and g would mean h is parallel to the line of intersection of f and g. So, h would be parallel to both f and g, lying in plane P.But then, any line e intersecting f and g would have to intersect h as well because e would be a transversal intersecting f and g, and since h is parallel to both, e would intersect h.Wait, no, if e intersects f and g, which are not parallel, then e is not necessarily a transversal. If f and g intersect, then e could pass through their intersection point, and h being parallel to both f and g would not intersect e unless e is parallel to h.Wait, I'm getting tangled up here. Let me try to summarize.If f and g are parallel, then h must be parallel to them as well, lying in the same plane. This ensures that any line e intersecting f and g must intersect h.If f and g intersect, then h must be parallel to both f and g, lying in the same plane. This ensures that any line e intersecting f and g must intersect h as well, because e would be a transversal intersecting f and g, and since h is parallel to both, e would intersect h.Wait, but if f and g intersect, and h is parallel to both, then h is parallel to the line of intersection of f and g. So, h is parallel to both f and g, lying in plane P.But then, if e intersects f and g, which intersect at a point, then e could pass through that intersection point, and h is parallel to both f and g, so e would not intersect h unless e is parallel to h.Wait, no, if e passes through the intersection point of f and g, and h is parallel to both f and g, then e would not intersect h because e is passing through the intersection point, which is not on h.But the condition says that any line e intersecting f and g must intersect h. So, if e passes through the intersection point of f and g, it must also intersect h. But if h is parallel to f and g, then h does not pass through that intersection point, so e would not intersect h, violating the condition.Therefore, if f and g intersect, h cannot be parallel to both f and g because that would allow e to intersect f and g without intersecting h.So, the only possibility is that f and g are parallel, and h is also parallel to them, lying in the same plane. This ensures that any line e intersecting f and g must intersect h as well.Therefore, the conclusion is that f, g, and h must be parallel lines lying in the same plane.Wait, but what if h is not in the same plane as f and g? If h is not in the same plane, then there could be lines e intersecting f and g that do not intersect h, violating the condition. So, h must be in the same plane as f and g.And if f and g are parallel, h must be parallel to them as well. If f and g intersect, h cannot be parallel to both without violating the condition, so f and g must be parallel.Therefore, the only possibility is that f, g, and h are parallel lines lying in the same plane.Yeah, that makes sense. So, the relative positions of f, g, and h are that they are all parallel lines in the same plane."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=ax^{3}+x^{2} has an extremum at x=-frac{4}{3}.¬†¬†(1) Determine the value of a;¬†¬†(2) If g(x)=f(x)e^{x}, discuss the monotonicity of g(x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about the function f(x) = a x¬≥ + x¬≤. It says that this function has an extremum at x = -4/3. I need to find the value of 'a' first. Hmm, extremum means it's either a maximum or a minimum, right? So, to find where the extrema are, I should take the derivative of f(x) and set it equal to zero at x = -4/3.Alright, let's compute the derivative f'(x). The derivative of a x¬≥ is 3a x¬≤, and the derivative of x¬≤ is 2x. So, f'(x) = 3a x¬≤ + 2x. Now, since there's an extremum at x = -4/3, plugging that into f'(x) should give zero. Let me do that:f'(-4/3) = 3a (-4/3)¬≤ + 2*(-4/3) = 0.Calculating (-4/3) squared is 16/9, so 3a times 16/9 is (48a)/9, which simplifies to (16a)/3. Then, 2 times (-4/3) is -8/3. So putting it together:(16a)/3 - 8/3 = 0.To solve for 'a', I can combine the terms:(16a - 8)/3 = 0.Multiplying both sides by 3 gives 16a - 8 = 0. Adding 8 to both sides: 16a = 8. Dividing both sides by 16: a = 8/16 = 1/2.So, a is 1/2. That seems straightforward. Let me just check my calculations to be sure. 3a times (16/9) is indeed (48a)/9 = 16a/3. 2 times (-4/3) is -8/3. So, 16a/3 - 8/3 = 0. Yeah, that's correct. So, a = 1/2.Alright, moving on to part (2). Now, we have g(x) = f(x) e^x. So, substituting f(x) from part (1), g(x) = ( (1/2)x¬≥ + x¬≤ ) e^x. I need to discuss the monotonicity of g(x), which means I need to find where it's increasing or decreasing. To do that, I should find the derivative g'(x) and analyze its sign.So, let's compute g'(x). Since g(x) is a product of two functions, f(x) and e^x, I'll use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of u*v is u'v + uv'. So, here, u = f(x) = (1/2)x¬≥ + x¬≤, and v = e^x. Therefore, u' is f'(x), which we already found in part (1). Wait, in part (1), f'(x) was 3a x¬≤ + 2x. Since a is 1/2, f'(x) becomes 3*(1/2)x¬≤ + 2x = (3/2)x¬≤ + 2x.So, u' = (3/2)x¬≤ + 2x, and v' = e^x. Therefore, g'(x) = u'v + uv' = [ (3/2)x¬≤ + 2x ] e^x + [ (1/2)x¬≥ + x¬≤ ] e^x.Let me factor out e^x since it's common to both terms:g'(x) = e^x [ (3/2)x¬≤ + 2x + (1/2)x¬≥ + x¬≤ ].Now, let's combine like terms inside the brackets. The x¬≥ term is (1/2)x¬≥. The x¬≤ terms are (3/2)x¬≤ + x¬≤, which is (3/2 + 2/2)x¬≤ = (5/2)x¬≤. The x term is 2x. So, putting it together:g'(x) = e^x [ (1/2)x¬≥ + (5/2)x¬≤ + 2x ].Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression further to make it easier to analyze. Let's factor out an x:g'(x) = e^x * x [ (1/2)x¬≤ + (5/2)x + 2 ].Now, let's look at the quadratic inside the brackets: (1/2)x¬≤ + (5/2)x + 2. To factor this, I can multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fractions:2*(1/2)x¬≤ + 2*(5/2)x + 2*2 = x¬≤ + 5x + 4.Now, factor x¬≤ + 5x + 4. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 4 and add to 5. That would be 1 and 4. So, x¬≤ + 5x + 4 = (x + 1)(x + 4).Therefore, going back to the expression:g'(x) = e^x * x [ (x + 1)(x + 4) ] / 2.Wait, because I multiplied by 2 earlier, so I need to divide by 2 now to keep the expression equivalent. So, actually, the quadratic was (1/2)x¬≤ + (5/2)x + 2, which factors into (1/2)(x + 1)(x + 4). Let me verify that:(1/2)(x + 1)(x + 4) = (1/2)(x¬≤ + 5x + 4) = (1/2)x¬≤ + (5/2)x + 2. Yes, that's correct.So, putting it all together:g'(x) = e^x * x * (1/2)(x + 1)(x + 4).So, simplifying, g'(x) = (e^x / 2) * x (x + 1)(x + 4).Now, since e^x is always positive for all real x, the sign of g'(x) depends on the product x (x + 1)(x + 4). So, to find where g'(x) is positive or negative, we can analyze the intervals determined by the roots of x (x + 1)(x + 4) = 0, which are x = -4, x = -1, and x = 0.These roots divide the real number line into four intervals:1. x < -42. -4 < x < -13. -1 < x < 04. x > 0Now, let's test each interval to determine the sign of the product x (x + 1)(x + 4) in each interval.1. For x < -4: Let's pick x = -5.   - x = -5 (negative)   - x + 1 = -4 (negative)   - x + 4 = -1 (negative)   Multiplying three negatives: (-)(-)(-) = negative.2. For -4 < x < -1: Let's pick x = -2.   - x = -2 (negative)   - x + 1 = -1 (negative)   - x + 4 = 2 (positive)   Multiplying two negatives and one positive: (-)(-)(+) = positive.3. For -1 < x < 0: Let's pick x = -0.5.   - x = -0.5 (negative)   - x + 1 = 0.5 (positive)   - x + 4 = 3.5 (positive)   Multiplying one negative and two positives: (-)(+)(+) = negative.4. For x > 0: Let's pick x = 1.   - x = 1 (positive)   - x + 1 = 2 (positive)   - x + 4 = 5 (positive)   Multiplying three positives: (+)(+)(+) = positive.So, summarizing:- When x < -4: g'(x) is negative, so g(x) is decreasing.- When -4 < x < -1: g'(x) is positive, so g(x) is increasing.- When -1 < x < 0: g'(x) is negative, so g(x) is decreasing.- When x > 0: g'(x) is positive, so g(x) is increasing.Therefore, the function g(x) is decreasing on the intervals (-‚àû, -4) and (-1, 0), and increasing on the intervals (-4, -1) and (0, ‚àû).I think that's all for the monotonicity. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. I found the derivative, factored it, identified the critical points, tested the intervals, and determined the sign of the derivative in each interval. Everything seems to check out. So, I'm confident with this analysis."},{"question":"The sports stadium has four gates on the south side and three gates on the north side.

Let me try to wrap my head around this.First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think this one is about geometric probability, which deals with lengths, areas, or volumes. Since we're dealing with intervals on a number line, it must be about lengths. So, the idea is that if ( x ) is chosen randomly within the interval ([-t, 4t]), what's the chance it falls within the smaller interval ([- frac{1}{2}t, t]).Let me recall: in geometric probability, the probability of an event is the ratio of the favorable length to the total length. So, I need to find the length of the interval ([- frac{1}{2}t, t]) and divide it by the length of the entire interval ([-t, 4t]).Okay, let's start by finding the length of the entire interval ([-t, 4t]). The length of an interval ([a, b]) is just ( b - a ). So, plugging in the values, it's ( 4t - (-t) ). Wait, subtracting a negative is like adding, so that becomes ( 4t + t = 5t ). Got it, the total length is ( 5t ).Now, onto the favorable interval ([- frac{1}{2}t, t]). Again, using the same formula for the length: ( t - (-frac{1}{2}t) ). Subtracting a negative is adding, so this becomes ( t + frac{1}{2}t ). Combining like terms, that's ( frac{3}{2}t ) or ( 1.5t ). So, the favorable length is ( frac{3}{2}t ).Now, to find the probability, I need to divide the favorable length by the total length. So, that's ( frac{frac{3}{2}t}{5t} ). Hmm, let me simplify that. The ( t ) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving ( frac{3}{2} div 5 ). Dividing by 5 is the same as multiplying by ( frac{1}{5} ), so ( frac{3}{2} times frac{1}{5} = frac{3}{10} ).Wait, so the probability is ( frac{3}{10} )? That seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Total interval: ([-t, 4t]). Length is ( 4t - (-t) = 5t ). Yep, that's correct.2. Favorable interval: ([- frac{1}{2}t, t]). Length is ( t - (-frac{1}{2}t) = frac{3}{2}t ). That also looks right.3. Probability: ( frac{frac{3}{2}t}{5t} = frac{3}{10} ). Yep, the ( t ) cancels, and the division is correct.Is there anything else I need to consider? Maybe whether the intervals overlap or not? Let's see. The entire interval is from (-t) to (4t), and the favorable interval is from (-frac{1}{2}t) to (t). So, (-frac{1}{2}t) is greater than (-t), and (t) is less than (4t). So, the favorable interval is entirely within the total interval. That means there's no overlap issue, and my calculation should be fine.Another thing to check: is the probability between 0 and 1? ( frac{3}{10} ) is 0.3, which is between 0 and 1, so that makes sense.Wait, just to visualize it, if I imagine the number line from (-t) to (4t), and then mark the favorable part from (-frac{1}{2}t) to (t), it's a smaller segment within the larger one. The lengths are proportional, so the probability should be the ratio of their lengths, which is exactly what I calculated.I think I'm confident with this answer. It all adds up correctly, and I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, yeah, the probability is ( frac{3}{10} ).**Final Answer**The probability that ( x in [-frac{1}{2}t, t] ) is boxed{dfrac{3}{10}}."},{"question":"A class needs to select 4 members from 4 boys and 2 girls to participate in a social event.

Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that the terminal side of angle Œ± intersects the unit circle x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 1 at point P(1/3, y‚ÇÄ). I need to find cos 2Œ± and choose the correct answer from the options given: A is 1/9, B is -7/9, C is -2/3, and D is 1/3.First, I remember that the unit circle has the equation x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 1, which means any point on the circle satisfies this equation. Since P(1/3, y‚ÇÄ) is on the unit circle, I can plug in x = 1/3 into the equation to find y‚ÇÄ.So, let's do that. If x = 1/3, then:(1/3)¬≤ + y‚ÇÄ¬≤ = 1Calculating (1/3)¬≤ gives 1/9, so:1/9 + y‚ÇÄ¬≤ = 1Subtracting 1/9 from both sides:y‚ÇÄ¬≤ = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9Taking the square root of both sides, y‚ÇÄ = ¬±‚àö(8/9) = ¬±2‚àö2/3.Hmm, okay, so y‚ÇÄ can be either positive or negative. But the problem doesn't specify which one, so I guess it doesn't matter for finding cos 2Œ±. Maybe I don't even need to find y‚ÇÄ explicitly.Wait, I need to find cos 2Œ±. I remember there's a double angle formula for cosine. Let me recall it. The formula is:cos 2Œ± = 2cos¬≤Œ± - 1Alternatively, it can also be written as:cos 2Œ± = 1 - 2sin¬≤Œ±But since I know the x-coordinate of point P, which is 1/3, and on the unit circle, the x-coordinate is cos Œ±. So, cos Œ± = 1/3.That's helpful. So, cos Œ± is 1/3. Now, I can plug this into the double angle formula.Using cos 2Œ± = 2cos¬≤Œ± - 1:cos 2Œ± = 2*(1/3)¬≤ - 1Calculating (1/3)¬≤ gives 1/9, so:cos 2Œ± = 2*(1/9) - 1 = 2/9 - 12/9 minus 1 is the same as 2/9 - 9/9 = -7/9.So, cos 2Œ± is -7/9. Looking back at the options, that's option B.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should verify using the other double angle formula to see if I get the same result.Using cos 2Œ± = 1 - 2sin¬≤Œ±.I know cos Œ± = 1/3, so sin Œ± can be found using the Pythagorean identity: sin¬≤Œ± + cos¬≤Œ± = 1.So, sin¬≤Œ± = 1 - cos¬≤Œ± = 1 - (1/3)¬≤ = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.Therefore, sin Œ± = ¬±‚àö(8/9) = ¬±2‚àö2/3, which matches what I found earlier for y‚ÇÄ.Now, plugging into the formula:cos 2Œ± = 1 - 2*(8/9) = 1 - 16/91 is 9/9, so:cos 2Œ± = 9/9 - 16/9 = -7/9Same result. Okay, that confirms it. So, cos 2Œ± is indeed -7/9.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer should be B: -7/9.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Points ( A, B, C, D, E ) are sequentially located on a line such that ( AB = BC = DE = 2 ) and ( CD = 1 ). Circles (Omega) and (omega) are tangent to each other, where (Omega) passes through points ( D ) and ( E ), and (omega) passes through points ( B ) and ( C ). Find the radii of the circles (Omega) and (omega) if it is known that their centers and point ( A ) lie on the same line.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here with points A, B, C, D, E on a line. The distances between them are given: AB = BC = DE = 2 units and CD = 1 unit. There are two circles, Œ© and œâ, that are tangent to each other. Œ© passes through D and E, and œâ passes through B and C. Also, the centers of these circles and point A lie on the same line. I need to find the radii of both circles.First, I think it would help to visualize the points on a straight line. Let me assign coordinates to each point to make it easier. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since AB = 2, point B would be at (2,0). BC is also 2, so point C is at (4,0). CD is 1, so point D is at (5,0). Finally, DE is 2, so point E is at (7,0).Now, the circles Œ© and œâ pass through these points. Circle Œ© passes through D(5,0) and E(7,0), so its center must lie somewhere perpendicular to the line DE. Similarly, circle œâ passes through B(2,0) and C(4,0), so its center must lie somewhere perpendicular to the line BC.Since the centers of both circles and point A are collinear, the line connecting the centers must pass through A(0,0). Let me denote the center of circle Œ© as O and the center of circle œâ as Q. Both O and Q lie on a line that passes through A.Let me denote the coordinates of O as (h, k) and Q as (m, n). But since they lie on the same line as A, which is the x-axis in my coordinate system, wait, no. Actually, the centers are not necessarily on the x-axis, but the line connecting the centers passes through A. Hmm, so the centers lie on a line that passes through A(0,0). So, the line connecting O and Q passes through the origin.Wait, but the circles are tangent to each other, so the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii if they are externally tangent or the difference if one is inside the other. Since they are just said to be tangent, I think it's safe to assume they are externally tangent, so the distance between centers is the sum of the radii.Let me think about the positions of the centers. For circle Œ© passing through D(5,0) and E(7,0), the center must be equidistant from D and E. So, the center lies on the perpendicular bisector of DE. The midpoint of DE is at (6,0), so the perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x=6. Similarly, for circle œâ passing through B(2,0) and C(4,0), the midpoint is at (3,0), so the perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x=3.Therefore, the centers O and Q must lie on x=6 and x=3 respectively. But wait, the line connecting O and Q must pass through A(0,0). So, the line connecting (6, y1) and (3, y2) must pass through (0,0). Let me write the equation of the line passing through (0,0), (3, y2), and (6, y1).The slope between (0,0) and (3, y2) is y2/3, and the slope between (3, y2) and (6, y1) is (y1 - y2)/3. Since it's a straight line, these slopes must be equal. Therefore, y2/3 = (y1 - y2)/3, which simplifies to y2 = y1 - y2, so y1 = 2y2.So, the y-coordinate of O is twice that of Q. Let me denote the y-coordinate of Q as r, so the y-coordinate of O is 2r. Therefore, the centers are O(6, 2r) and Q(3, r).Now, let's find the radii of the circles. For circle Œ©, the radius R is the distance from O(6, 2r) to D(5,0). Using the distance formula:R = sqrt[(6 - 5)^2 + (2r - 0)^2] = sqrt[1 + 4r^2]Similarly, for circle œâ, the radius r is the distance from Q(3, r) to B(2,0):r = sqrt[(3 - 2)^2 + (r - 0)^2] = sqrt[1 + r^2]Wait, that's interesting. The radius of œâ is sqrt(1 + r^2), but I denoted the y-coordinate as r. That might be confusing. Let me correct that. Let me denote the y-coordinate of Q as h, so the center Q is at (3, h). Then, the radius of œâ is sqrt[(3 - 2)^2 + (h - 0)^2] = sqrt[1 + h^2]. Similarly, the center O is at (6, 2h), so the radius R is sqrt[(6 - 5)^2 + (2h - 0)^2] = sqrt[1 + 4h^2].Now, since the circles are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii. The distance between O(6, 2h) and Q(3, h) is sqrt[(6 - 3)^2 + (2h - h)^2] = sqrt[9 + h^2].So, we have:sqrt[9 + h^2] = sqrt[1 + 4h^2] + sqrt[1 + h^2]This is the equation we need to solve for h.Let me denote sqrt[1 + 4h^2] as R and sqrt[1 + h^2] as r. So, the equation becomes:sqrt[9 + h^2] = R + rBut we can also express R and r in terms of h:R = sqrt[1 + 4h^2]r = sqrt[1 + h^2]So, we have:sqrt[9 + h^2] = sqrt[1 + 4h^2] + sqrt[1 + h^2]This seems a bit complicated, but let's try squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots.Let me denote S = sqrt[9 + h^2], T = sqrt[1 + 4h^2], and U = sqrt[1 + h^2]. So, S = T + U.Squaring both sides:S^2 = (T + U)^2Which gives:9 + h^2 = T^2 + 2TU + U^2But T^2 = 1 + 4h^2 and U^2 = 1 + h^2, so:9 + h^2 = (1 + 4h^2) + 2TU + (1 + h^2)Simplify the right side:9 + h^2 = 1 + 4h^2 + 1 + h^2 + 2TUCombine like terms:9 + h^2 = 2 + 5h^2 + 2TUSubtract 2 + 5h^2 from both sides:9 + h^2 - 2 - 5h^2 = 2TUSimplify:7 - 4h^2 = 2TUDivide both sides by 2:(7 - 4h^2)/2 = TUNow, TU = sqrt[1 + 4h^2] * sqrt[1 + h^2]Let me compute TU:TU = sqrt{(1 + 4h^2)(1 + h^2)} = sqrt{1 + h^2 + 4h^2 + 4h^4} = sqrt{1 + 5h^2 + 4h^4}So, we have:(7 - 4h^2)/2 = sqrt{1 + 5h^2 + 4h^4}Now, let's square both sides again to eliminate the square root:[(7 - 4h^2)/2]^2 = (1 + 5h^2 + 4h^4)Compute the left side:(49 - 56h^2 + 16h^4)/4 = 1 + 5h^2 + 4h^4Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:49 - 56h^2 + 16h^4 = 4 + 20h^2 + 16h^4Subtract 4 + 20h^2 + 16h^4 from both sides:49 - 56h^2 + 16h^4 - 4 - 20h^2 - 16h^4 = 0Simplify:45 - 76h^2 = 0So,76h^2 = 45h^2 = 45/76h = sqrt(45/76) = (3*sqrt(5))/(2*sqrt(19)) = (3*sqrt(95))/38Wait, let me check that simplification. sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5), and sqrt(76) is 2*sqrt(19). So,h = 3*sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(19)) = (3*sqrt(95))/38But maybe it's better to rationalize the denominator:h = (3*sqrt(5))/(2*sqrt(19)) = (3*sqrt(5)*sqrt(19))/(2*19) = (3*sqrt(95))/38Okay, so h = 3*sqrt(95)/38Now, let's find the radii R and r.First, r = sqrt[1 + h^2] = sqrt[1 + (45/76)] = sqrt[(76 + 45)/76] = sqrt[121/76] = 11/sqrt(76) = 11*sqrt(76)/76 = 11*sqrt(19*4)/76 = 11*2*sqrt(19)/76 = 22*sqrt(19)/76 = 11*sqrt(19)/38Similarly, R = sqrt[1 + 4h^2] = sqrt[1 + 4*(45/76)] = sqrt[1 + 180/76] = sqrt[(76 + 180)/76] = sqrt[256/76] = 16/sqrt(76) = 16*sqrt(76)/76 = 16*sqrt(19*4)/76 = 16*2*sqrt(19)/76 = 32*sqrt(19)/76 = 8*sqrt(19)/19Wait, let me double-check these calculations.For r:r = sqrt[1 + h^2] = sqrt[1 + 45/76] = sqrt[(76 + 45)/76] = sqrt[121/76] = 11/sqrt(76). Rationalizing, 11*sqrt(76)/76. Since 76 = 4*19, sqrt(76) = 2*sqrt(19). So, 11*2*sqrt(19)/76 = 22*sqrt(19)/76 = 11*sqrt(19)/38.For R:R = sqrt[1 + 4h^2] = sqrt[1 + 4*(45/76)] = sqrt[1 + 180/76] = sqrt[(76 + 180)/76] = sqrt[256/76] = 16/sqrt(76). Rationalizing, 16*sqrt(76)/76 = 16*2*sqrt(19)/76 = 32*sqrt(19)/76 = 8*sqrt(19)/19.Yes, that seems correct.So, the radii are R = 8*sqrt(19)/19 and r = 11*sqrt(19)/38.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra when solving for h.We had:76h^2 = 45So, h^2 = 45/76Yes, that's correct.Then, for r:r = sqrt[1 + h^2] = sqrt[1 + 45/76] = sqrt[(76 + 45)/76] = sqrt[121/76] = 11/sqrt(76) = 11*sqrt(76)/76 = 11*2*sqrt(19)/76 = 22*sqrt(19)/76 = 11*sqrt(19)/38.Similarly, R = sqrt[1 + 4h^2] = sqrt[1 + 4*(45/76)] = sqrt[1 + 180/76] = sqrt[(76 + 180)/76] = sqrt[256/76] = 16/sqrt(76) = 16*sqrt(76)/76 = 16*2*sqrt(19)/76 = 32*sqrt(19)/76 = 8*sqrt(19)/19.Yes, that seems consistent.So, the radii are R = 8*sqrt(19)/19 and r = 11*sqrt(19)/38.I think that's the solution."},{"question":"Given a sequence {a_n} (n in mathbb{N}^*, 1 leq n leq 46) that satisfies a_1 = a, a_{n+1} - a_n = begin{cases} d, & 1 leq n leq 15  1, & 16 leq n leq 30  frac {1}{d}, & 31 leq n leq 45 end{cases}, where d neq 0 and n in mathbb{N}^*.

If a=frac{1}{3} and d=frac{1}{4}, prove that 2 in M.","answer":"Alright, so I'm looking at this problem about a sequence {a_n} where n ranges from 1 to 46. The sequence starts with a_1 = a, and the difference between consecutive terms changes depending on the value of n. Specifically, from n=1 to n=15, the difference is d; from n=16 to n=30, the difference is 1; and from n=31 to n=45, the difference is 1/d. Part (1) asks me to find the expression for a_{46} when a=1 and then determine the range of a_{46}. Okay, so let's break this down step by step.First, since a_1 = 1, I can start by figuring out the terms up to a_{16}. The difference between each term from a_1 to a_{16} is d. So, a_2 = a_1 + d = 1 + d. Similarly, a_3 = a_2 + d = 1 + 2d, and so on. In general, a_n = 1 + (n-1)d for n from 1 to 16. Therefore, a_{16} = 1 + 15d.Next, from a_{17} to a_{31}, the difference between each term is 1. So, starting from a_{16} = 1 + 15d, each subsequent term increases by 1. Therefore, a_{17} = a_{16} + 1 = 1 + 15d + 1 = 2 + 15d. Continuing this way, a_{31} = a_{16} + 15*1 = 1 + 15d + 15 = 16 + 15d.Now, from a_{32} to a_{46}, the difference between each term is 1/d. So, starting from a_{31} = 16 + 15d, each subsequent term increases by 1/d. Therefore, a_{32} = a_{31} + 1/d = 16 + 15d + 1/d. Continuing this way, a_{46} = a_{31} + 15*(1/d) = 16 + 15d + 15/d.So, the expression for a_{46} is 16 + 15d + 15/d. Now, to find the range of a_{46}, I need to analyze this expression. Let's denote f(d) = 16 + 15d + 15/d.I know that for any real number d ‚â† 0, the expression d + 1/d has certain properties. Specifically, if d > 0, then d + 1/d ‚â• 2 by the AM-GM inequality. If d < 0, then d + 1/d ‚â§ -2 because both d and 1/d are negative, and their sum is minimized when d = -1, giving -2.Therefore, multiplying by 15, we have 15d + 15/d ‚â• 30 when d > 0, and 15d + 15/d ‚â§ -30 when d < 0. Adding 16 to these, we get f(d) ‚â• 46 when d > 0, and f(d) ‚â§ -14 when d < 0.So, the range of a_{46} is (-‚àû, -14] ‚à™ [46, ‚àû).Moving on to part (2), we have a set M defined as {b | b = a_i + a_j + a_k, where i, j, k are natural numbers with 1 ‚â§ i < j < k ‚â§ 16}. We are given that a = 1/3 and d = 1/4. We need to prove that 2 ‚àà M.First, let's find the general form of a_n for 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 16. Since a_1 = 1/3 and the difference is d = 1/4, each term increases by 1/4. So, a_n = 1/3 + (n - 1)*(1/4).Therefore, a_n = 1/3 + (n - 1)/4. Let's compute a few terms to verify:a_1 = 1/3 + 0 = 1/3a_2 = 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12a_3 = 1/3 + 2/4 = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6a_4 = 1/3 + 3/4 = 13/12a_5 = 1/3 + 4/4 = 1/3 + 1 = 4/3Okay, so the terms are increasing by 1/4 each time.Now, we need to find three distinct indices i, j, k (with 1 ‚â§ i < j < k ‚â§ 16) such that a_i + a_j + a_k = 2.Let's express a_i + a_j + a_k in terms of i, j, k.a_i = 1/3 + (i - 1)/4a_j = 1/3 + (j - 1)/4a_k = 1/3 + (k - 1)/4Adding them up:a_i + a_j + a_k = 3*(1/3) + [(i - 1) + (j - 1) + (k - 1)]/4Simplify:= 1 + (i + j + k - 3)/4We need this sum to equal 2:1 + (i + j + k - 3)/4 = 2Subtract 1 from both sides:(i + j + k - 3)/4 = 1Multiply both sides by 4:i + j + k - 3 = 4Add 3 to both sides:i + j + k = 7So, we need to find three distinct indices i, j, k such that their sum is 7, with 1 ‚â§ i < j < k ‚â§ 16.Let's find such indices. The smallest possible sum for three distinct indices is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is less than 7. The next possible sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.Yes, that works. So, i=1, j=2, k=4.Let's verify:a_1 = 1/3a_2 = 7/12a_4 = 13/12Adding them up:1/3 + 7/12 + 13/12Convert to twelfths:4/12 + 7/12 + 13/12 = (4 + 7 + 13)/12 = 24/12 = 2Perfect, that sums to 2. Therefore, 2 ‚àà M.Alternatively, there might be other combinations, but this one works.So, in conclusion, by choosing i=1, j=2, and k=4, we have a_i + a_j + a_k = 2, which proves that 2 is indeed in set M."},{"question":"Find the distance from the point ( M_{0}(1,-1,2) ) to the plane passing through the points ( M_{1}(1,5,-7) ), ( M_{2}(-3,6,3) ), and ( M_{3}(-2,7,3) ).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the distance from the point M‚ÇÄ(1, -1, 2) to a plane that passes through three other points: M‚ÇÅ(1, 5, -7), M‚ÇÇ(-3, 6, 3), and M‚ÇÉ(-2, 7, 3). Hmm, I remember that to find the distance from a point to a plane, I first need the equation of the plane. To get the equation of the plane, I need a normal vector to the plane. How do I find a normal vector? Oh, right, I can use the cross product of two vectors that lie on the plane. So, I should find two vectors in the plane first. Let me see, I can take vectors from M‚ÇÅ to M‚ÇÇ and from M‚ÇÅ to M‚ÇÉ. That should work because those vectors will both lie on the plane.Alright, let me calculate vector M‚ÇÅM‚ÇÇ. That would be M‚ÇÇ minus M‚ÇÅ. So, for the x-component: -3 - 1 = -4. For the y-component: 6 - 5 = 1. For the z-component: 3 - (-7) = 10. So, vector M‚ÇÅM‚ÇÇ is (-4, 1, 10).Next, vector M‚ÇÅM‚ÇÉ. That's M‚ÇÉ minus M‚ÇÅ. So, x-component: -2 - 1 = -3. Y-component: 7 - 5 = 2. Z-component: 3 - (-7) = 10. So, vector M‚ÇÅM‚ÇÉ is (-3, 2, 10).Now, I need to find the cross product of these two vectors to get the normal vector. Let me recall how to compute the cross product. If I have vectors a = (a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÉ) and b = (b‚ÇÅ, b‚ÇÇ, b‚ÇÉ), then the cross product a √ó b is given by the determinant of the matrix:|i ¬†¬†j ¬†¬†k||a‚ÇÅ a‚ÇÇ a‚ÇÉ||b‚ÇÅ b‚ÇÇ b‚ÇÉ|So, plugging in the components:i component: (1)(10) - (10)(2) = 10 - 20 = -10j component: -[( -4)(10) - (10)(-3)] = -[ -40 + 30 ] = -[ -10 ] = 10k component: ( -4)(2) - (1)(-3) = -8 + 3 = -5So, the normal vector n is (-10, 10, -5).

What is the ones digit of the result?","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the ones digit of 73 raised to the power of 351. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky at first, but maybe there's a pattern I can use. I remember that the ones digit of a number raised to a power often follows a repeating cycle. So, maybe if I can figure out the pattern of the ones digits for powers of 73, I can determine what the ones digit is for the 351st power.First, let's focus on the ones digit of 73. The number 73 ends with a 3, so the ones digit is 3. That means I can simplify the problem to finding the ones digit of 3 raised to the 351st power. That should make things easier.Now, let's see if there's a pattern in the ones digits when 3 is raised to different powers. I'll start calculating the ones digits for the first few powers of 3:- 3^1 = 3. The ones digit is 3.- 3^2 = 9. The ones digit is 9.- 3^3 = 27. The ones digit is 7.- 3^4 = 81. The ones digit is 1.- 3^5 = 243. The ones digit is 3 again.Oh, interesting! After the fourth power, the ones digit cycles back to 3. So the pattern of the ones digits for powers of 3 is 3, 9, 7, 1, and then repeats every four powers. That means the cycle length is 4.Since the pattern repeats every 4 powers, I can use modular arithmetic to find out where 351 falls in this cycle. Specifically, I'll divide 351 by 4 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me which position in the cycle we're at.Let's do that division:351 divided by 4 is 87 with a remainder of 3. So, 351 mod 4 equals 3. That means 351 is 3 more than a multiple of 4. In terms of the cycle, that would correspond to the third position in the pattern.Looking back at the pattern of ones digits: 3 (first position), 9 (second), 7 (third), 1 (fourth). So, the third position has a ones digit of 7.Therefore, the ones digit of 3^351 is 7. Since 73^351 has the same ones digit as 3^351, the ones digit of 73^351 is also 7.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I consider the cycle length of 4, and 351 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3, then the ones digit should be the third in the cycle, which is 7. Yeah, that seems right.Just to be thorough, let me test this with a smaller exponent to see if my pattern holds. Let's take 3^3, which should have a ones digit of 7. Calculating 3^3 gives 27, and the ones digit is indeed 7. Similarly, 3^7 should also have a ones digit of 7. Calculating 3^7 gives 2187, and the ones digit is 7. Okay, so my pattern seems consistent.I think I'm confident now that the ones digit of 73^351 is 7."},{"question":"A reservoir needs to transport water to a distant village using a main pipe of 12'' inside diameter.

Factoring this, I look for two numbers that multiply to 24 and add up to -10. These numbers are -6 and -4. So, the factored form is:y^2 - 10y + 24 = (y - 6)(y - 4)For the second fraction, the numerator is ( 4y^2 + 8y - 48 ). I can factor out a 4 first:4y^2 + 8y - 48 = 4(y^2 + 2y - 12)Now, I'll factor ( y^2 + 2y - 12 ). Looking for two numbers that multiply to -12 and add up to 2, I find 4 and -3. Thus:y^2 + 2y - 12 = (y - 2)(y + 6)So, the factored form of the second numerator is:4(y - 2)(y + 6)Now, I'll substitute these factored forms back into the original equation:frac{(y - 6)(y - 4)}{y - 2} + frac{4(y - 2)(y + 6)}{4(y - 2)} = 0Next, I'll simplify each fraction. For the first fraction, since ( y neq 2 ) to avoid division by zero, I can cancel out ( y - 2 ):frac{(y - 6)(y - 4)}{y - 2} = y - 6For the second fraction, I notice that both the numerator and the denominator have a factor of 4 and ( y - 2 ). Again, since ( y neq 2 ), I can cancel these out:frac{4(y - 2)(y + 6)}{4(y - 2)} = y + 6Now, the equation simplifies to:y - 6 + y + 6 = 0Combining like terms:2y = 0Solving for ( y ):y = 0Finally, I'll check if ( y = 0 ) is a valid solution.

Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the correct symmetry axis. First, I remember that symmetry axes for sine functions are related to their maximum and minimum points. The standard sine function ( y = sin(x) ) has symmetry about its midline, which is the x-axis in this case. But when the sine function is transformed, like with a phase shift or a change in period, the symmetry axis can shift as well.Looking at the given function ( y = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) ), I notice that it's a sine function with a horizontal compression and a phase shift. The general form of a sine function is ( y = sin(Bx + C) ), where ( B ) affects the period and ( C ) affects the phase shift. The period of the sine function is given by ( frac{2pi}{B} ). In this case, ( B = 2 ), so the period is ( frac{2pi}{2} = pi ). That means the function completes a full cycle every ( pi ) units instead of ( 2pi ). Next, the phase shift is calculated by ( -frac{C}{B} ). Here, ( C = frac{pi}{3} ), so the phase shift is ( -frac{pi/3}{2} = -frac{pi}{6} ). This tells me that the graph is shifted to the left by ( frac{pi}{6} ) units. Now, thinking about the symmetry axis. For a sine function, the symmetry axis is typically the vertical line passing through the maximum or minimum point. Since the function is shifted, I need to find where the maximum or minimum occurs after the phase shift.The maximum value of ( sin ) occurs at ( frac{pi}{2} ) in the standard sine function. So, to find the corresponding x-value after the transformations, I set up the equation:( 2x + frac{pi}{3} = frac{pi}{2} + 2pi k ) where ( k ) is any integer.Solving for ( x ):( 2x = frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{3} + 2pi k )First, find a common denominator for the fractions:( frac{pi}{2} = frac{3pi}{6} ) and ( frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{6} ), so subtracting:( frac{3pi}{6} - frac{2pi}{6} = frac{pi}{6} )So,( 2x = frac{pi}{6} + 2pi k )Divide both sides by 2:( x = frac{pi}{12} + pi k )This gives the x-values where the function reaches its maximum. Similarly, the minimum occurs at:( 2x + frac{pi}{3} = frac{3pi}{2} + 2pi k )Following similar steps:( 2x = frac{3pi}{2} - frac{pi}{3} + 2pi k )Convert to a common denominator:( frac{3pi}{2} = frac{9pi}{6} ) and ( frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{6} ), so subtracting:( frac{9pi}{6} - frac{2pi}{6} = frac{7pi}{6} )Thus,( 2x = frac{7pi}{6} + 2pi k )Divide by 2:( x = frac{7pi}{12} + pi k )So, the function has maximum points at ( x = frac{pi}{12} + pi k ) and minimum points at ( x = frac{7pi}{12} + pi k ). The symmetry axis should lie midway between a maximum and the next minimum. Let's take ( k = 0 ) for simplicity. The maximum is at ( x = frac{pi}{12} ) and the minimum is at ( x = frac{7pi}{12} ). The midpoint between these two is:( frac{frac{pi}{12} + frac{7pi}{12}}{2} = frac{frac{8pi}{12}}{2} = frac{frac{2pi}{3}}{2} = frac{pi}{3} )Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations.Wait, actually, the midpoint between ( frac{pi}{12} ) and ( frac{7pi}{12} ) is:( frac{frac{pi}{12} + frac{7pi}{12}}{2} = frac{frac{8pi}{12}}{2} = frac{frac{2pi}{3}}{2} = frac{pi}{3} )Hmm, but ( frac{pi}{3} ) isn't one of the options. Did I make a mistake?Wait, maybe I should consider the axis of symmetry differently. Since the function is sinusoidal, it's symmetric about its midline. The midline of the function ( y = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) ) is y = 0, but the question is about the vertical symmetry axis, not the horizontal midline.So, perhaps the axis of symmetry is the line that divides the wave into two mirror images. For a standard sine wave, this would be the line through the maximum or minimum. But since this function is transformed, the axis of symmetry would be at the phase-shifted maximum or minimum.Wait, earlier I found that the maximum occurs at ( x = frac{pi}{12} + pi k ). So, for ( k = 0 ), the maximum is at ( x = frac{pi}{12} ). That should be the axis of symmetry.Looking back at the options, D is ( x = frac{pi}{12} ), which matches my calculation. So, that should be the answer.But just to be thorough, let me check another approach. The general form of a sine function is ( y = sin(Bx + C) ). The phase shift is ( -C/B ), which in this case is ( -frac{pi}{6} ). So, the graph is shifted left by ( frac{pi}{6} ).But how does that relate to the axis of symmetry? The standard sine function has its axis of symmetry at ( x = frac{pi}{2} ) for the first maximum. After shifting left by ( frac{pi}{6} ), the new maximum should be at ( frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{3} ). Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier result.Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let's think again.The standard sine function ( y = sin(x) ) has its first maximum at ( x = frac{pi}{2} ). When we apply the transformation ( y = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) ), it's equivalent to ( y = sin[2(x + frac{pi}{6})] ). So, the phase shift is ( -frac{pi}{6} ), meaning the graph is shifted left by ( frac{pi}{6} ).But the period is now ( pi ), so the distance between a maximum and the next maximum is ( pi ). Therefore, the first maximum after the shift would be at ( x = frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{3} ). Wait, but earlier I calculated the maximum at ( x = frac{pi}{12} ). There's a discrepancy here.Let me clarify. The function ( y = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) ) can be rewritten as ( y = sin[2(x + frac{pi}{6})] ). So, the phase shift is ( -frac{pi}{6} ), meaning the graph is shifted left by ( frac{pi}{6} ). But the period is ( pi ), so the distance between a maximum and the next maximum is ( pi ). The standard sine function has its first maximum at ( x = frac{pi}{2} ). After shifting left by ( frac{pi}{6} ), the first maximum should be at ( frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{3} ). However, when I solved for the maximum earlier, I got ( x = frac{pi}{12} ). That seems inconsistent. Let me check that again.Starting with ( 2x + frac{pi}{3} = frac{pi}{2} + 2pi k ).Solving for x:( 2x = frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{3} + 2pi k )Convert to common denominator:( frac{pi}{2} = frac{3pi}{6} ), ( frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{6} )So,( 2x = frac{3pi}{6} - frac{2pi}{6} + 2pi k = frac{pi}{6} + 2pi k )Divide by 2:( x = frac{pi}{12} + pi k )Ah, okay, so for ( k = 0 ), it's ( frac{pi}{12} ), and for ( k = 1 ), it's ( frac{pi}{12} + pi = frac{13pi}{12} ), and so on.But earlier, I thought the first maximum after the shift should be at ( frac{pi}{3} ). That's approximately 1.047, while ( frac{pi}{12} ) is approximately 0.2618. So, which one is correct?Wait, maybe I'm confusing the phase shift with the period. Let me plot the function or think about it differently.The function ( y = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) ) can be seen as a sine wave with double the frequency and shifted left by ( frac{pi}{6} ). So, the first maximum should occur at ( x = frac{pi}{12} ), because the period is ( pi ), so the maximum occurs every ( pi ) units, starting from ( frac{pi}{12} ).Alternatively, if I consider the standard sine function ( y = sin(x) ) with maximum at ( frac{pi}{2} ), after shifting left by ( frac{pi}{6} ), the maximum should be at ( frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{3} ). But since the period is halved, the maximum occurs more frequently.Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the phase shift is applied before the period change. Let me think about the order of transformations.The function is ( y = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) ). This can be rewritten as ( y = sin[2(x + frac{pi}{6})] ). So, first, we shift the graph left by ( frac{pi}{6} ), and then we horizontally compress it by a factor of 2, effectively halving the period.So, starting from the standard sine function, which has a maximum at ( x = frac{pi}{2} ). After shifting left by ( frac{pi}{6} ), the maximum would be at ( frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{3} ). Then, after compressing the graph horizontally by a factor of 2, the x-values are scaled by ( frac{1}{2} ), so the maximum occurs at ( frac{pi}{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{pi}{6} ). Wait, that doesn't seem right.Alternatively, when we compress the graph horizontally by a factor of 2, the x-values are multiplied by 2. So, if the maximum was at ( frac{pi}{3} ) before compression, after compression, it would be at ( frac{pi}{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{pi}{6} ). But that contradicts the earlier result of ( frac{pi}{12} ).I think I'm getting confused with the order of transformations. Let me approach it differently.Let me consider the general form ( y = sin(Bx + C) ). The phase shift is ( -C/B ), and the period is ( 2pi / B ). The maximum occurs at ( x = frac{pi}{2B} - frac{C}{B} ).So, in this case, ( B = 2 ), ( C = frac{pi}{3} ). Therefore, the maximum occurs at:( x = frac{pi}{2 times 2} - frac{pi/3}{2} = frac{pi}{4} - frac{pi}{6} )Convert to common denominator:( frac{pi}{4} = frac{3pi}{12} ), ( frac{pi}{6} = frac{2pi}{12} )So,( x = frac{3pi}{12} - frac{2pi}{12} = frac{pi}{12} )Ah, okay, so that confirms the earlier result. The maximum occurs at ( x = frac{pi}{12} ). Therefore, the axis of symmetry is at ( x = frac{pi}{12} ), which is option D.I think my confusion earlier was due to trying to apply the phase shift and period changes in the wrong order, but using the formula for the maximum point gives a clear answer.So, to summarize, the function ( y = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) ) has its first maximum at ( x = frac{pi}{12} ), which is the axis of symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is D: ( x = frac{pi}{12} )."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=x^{2}+2ax+2, where x in [-5,5].(1) When a=-1, find the maximum and minimum values of the function;(2) Find the range of real numbers a such that y=f(x) is a monotonic function on the interval [-5,5].","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = x¬≤ + 2a x + 2, and I need to do two things with it. First, when a is -1, I need to find the maximum and minimum values of the function on the interval [-5, 5]. Second, I need to find all real numbers a such that the function is monotonic on the same interval. Hmm, let me start with part (1).Alright, when a is -1, the function becomes f(x) = x¬≤ + 2*(-1)x + 2, which simplifies to f(x) = x¬≤ - 2x + 2. Okay, so that's a quadratic function. Quadratic functions have a parabola shape, and since the coefficient of x¬≤ is positive (1 in this case), it opens upwards. That means it has a minimum point at its vertex and no maximum point unless we restrict the domain, which we are doing here to [-5, 5].So, to find the minimum value, I need to find the vertex of this parabola. The vertex of a quadratic function f(x) = ax¬≤ + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a is 1, b is -2, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is -(-2)/(2*1) = 2/2 = 1. So, the vertex is at x = 1. Let me compute f(1) to find the minimum value.f(1) = (1)¬≤ - 2*(1) + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, the minimum value is 1 at x = 1.Now, for the maximum value on the interval [-5, 5], since the parabola opens upwards, the maximum will occur at one of the endpoints of the interval. So, I need to evaluate f(x) at x = -5 and x = 5 and see which one is larger.Let's compute f(-5):f(-5) = (-5)¬≤ - 2*(-5) + 2 = 25 + 10 + 2 = 37.Now, f(5):f(5) = (5)¬≤ - 2*(5) + 2 = 25 - 10 + 2 = 17.Comparing f(-5) = 37 and f(5) = 17, clearly 37 is larger. So, the maximum value is 37 at x = -5.So, for part (1), the minimum value is 1 at x = 1, and the maximum value is 37 at x = -5.Moving on to part (2): Find the range of real numbers a such that y = f(x) is a monotonic function on the interval [-5, 5].Monotonic means the function is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing on the interval. Since f(x) is a quadratic function, it's a parabola, which is not monotonic over the entire real line because it has a vertex where it changes direction. However, if the interval [-5, 5] is entirely on one side of the vertex, then the function will be monotonic on that interval.So, the vertex of f(x) = x¬≤ + 2a x + 2 is at x = -b/(2a) where in this case, the quadratic is x¬≤ + 2a x + 2, so a (the coefficient) is 1, and b is 2a. Wait, hold on, that might be confusing because the coefficient of x is 2a, so actually, the standard form is f(x) = ax¬≤ + bx + c, so here, a = 1, b = 2a, c = 2.Wait, that might be confusing because the coefficient of x is 2a, so actually, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = -(2a)/(2*1) = -a. So, the vertex is at x = -a.Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on (-‚àû, -a] and increasing on [-a, ‚àû). So, for the function to be monotonic on [-5, 5], the entire interval [-5, 5] must lie either entirely in the decreasing part or entirely in the increasing part.So, if the interval [-5, 5] is entirely in the increasing part, that means the vertex x = -a must be to the left of -5. So, -a ‚â§ -5, which implies a ‚â• 5.Alternatively, if the interval [-5, 5] is entirely in the decreasing part, then the vertex x = -a must be to the right of 5. So, -a ‚â• 5, which implies a ‚â§ -5.Therefore, the function is monotonic on [-5, 5] if a is either greater than or equal to 5 or less than or equal to -5. So, the range of a is (-‚àû, -5] ‚à™ [5, ‚àû).Wait, let me double-check that. If a is 5, then the vertex is at x = -5. So, the function is increasing on [-5, ‚àû), so on [-5, 5], it's increasing. Similarly, if a is -5, the vertex is at x = 5, so the function is decreasing on (-‚àû, 5], so on [-5, 5], it's decreasing. So, yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the range of a is all real numbers less than or equal to -5 and greater than or equal to 5.So, summarizing:1. When a = -1, the function f(x) has a minimum value of 1 at x = 1 and a maximum value of 37 at x = -5.2. The function f(x) is monotonic on [-5, 5] if a is in (-‚àû, -5] ‚à™ [5, ‚àû).**Final Answer**(1) The maximum value is boxed{37} and the minimum value is boxed{1}.(2) The range of a is boxed{(-infty, -5] cup [5, +infty)}."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" is a condition for \\"C = 90¬∞\\" (¬†¬† )A: Sufficient but not necessary conditionB: Necessary but not sufficient conditionC: Necessary and sufficient conditionD: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about triangle ABC, and it's asking about the relationship between two conditions: \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" and \\"C = 90¬∞\\". The question is whether the first condition is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither for the second condition. The options are A, B, C, D, with B being \\"Necessary but not sufficient condition\\".Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I need to recall what it means for a condition to be sufficient, necessary, both, or neither. A sufficient condition means that if it's met, then the other condition must be true. A necessary condition means that for the other condition to be true, this condition must be met, but it doesn't guarantee it. If it's both, then it's a necessary and sufficient condition, meaning they imply each other. If it's neither, then it doesn't guarantee or require the other condition.So, in this case, the question is whether \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for \\"C = 90¬∞\\".First, let's consider what \\"C = 90¬∞\\" implies about angles A and B. In a triangle, the sum of angles is 180¬∞, so if C is 90¬∞, then A + B must be 90¬∞. That means A and B are complementary angles.Now, if A and B are complementary, does that mean \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\"? Let's see. Since A + B = 90¬∞, B = 90¬∞ - A. So, let's substitute B with 90¬∞ - A in the equation.So, cosB + sinB becomes cos(90¬∞ - A) + sin(90¬∞ - A). I remember that cos(90¬∞ - A) is sinA, and sin(90¬∞ - A) is cosA. So, cosB + sinB becomes sinA + cosA. Therefore, cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB when A + B = 90¬∞, which is when C = 90¬∞.Okay, so if C is 90¬∞, then \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" must hold. That suggests that \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" is a necessary condition for C = 90¬∞, because whenever C is 90¬∞, this equality must be true.But is it sufficient? That is, if \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\", does that necessarily mean that C = 90¬∞? Let's check.Suppose that \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\". Does this imply that A + B = 90¬∞, hence C = 90¬∞? Or could there be other scenarios where this equality holds without C being 90¬∞?Let me think. Suppose A = B. Then, obviously, cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB because they are equal. So, if A = B, regardless of what C is, this equality holds. But in a triangle, if A = B, then it's an isosceles triangle, but C doesn't have to be 90¬∞. It could be acute or obtuse.So, for example, if A = B = 45¬∞, then C = 90¬∞, which is the case we considered earlier. But if A = B = 50¬∞, then C = 80¬∞, which is not 90¬∞, yet cosA + sinA would still equal cosB + sinB because A = B.Therefore, \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" can hold even when C is not 90¬∞, as long as A = B. So, this means that the condition is not sufficient to conclude that C = 90¬∞, because there are cases where the equality holds without C being 90¬∞.Therefore, \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" is a necessary condition for C = 90¬∞, because whenever C is 90¬∞, the equality must hold. However, it is not a sufficient condition because the equality can hold in other cases where C is not 90¬∞.So, putting it all together, the condition is necessary but not sufficient. Therefore, the correct answer is B.Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other scenario where \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" could hold besides when A = B or when A + B = 90¬∞? Hmm, let's see.Suppose A ‚â† B and A + B ‚â† 90¬∞, can \\"cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB\\" still hold? Let's try specific values. Let's say A = 30¬∞, B = 60¬∞, then cos30 + sin30 = ‚àö3/2 + 1/2 ‚âà 0.866 + 0.5 = 1.366. Cos60 + sin60 = 0.5 + ‚àö3/2 ‚âà 0.5 + 0.866 = 1.366. So, in this case, even though A + B = 90¬∞, which is the case for C = 90¬∞, the equality holds. But wait, in this case, A + B = 90¬∞, so C = 90¬∞, which is the necessary condition.But earlier, I considered A = B = 50¬∞, which gives C = 80¬∞, and the equality still holds. So, in that case, it's not necessary for C to be 90¬∞, but the equality still holds because A = B.Is there a case where A ‚â† B and A + B ‚â† 90¬∞, yet cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB? Let's try A = 45¬∞, B = 45¬∞, which gives C = 90¬∞, but that's the same as A = B. What about A = 30¬∞, B = 30¬∞, then C = 120¬∞, and cos30 + sin30 ‚âà 0.866 + 0.5 = 1.366, same for B, so equality holds.Wait, but if A = 30¬∞, B = 60¬∞, then A + B = 90¬∞, which is C = 90¬∞, and equality holds. If A = 45¬∞, B = 45¬∞, C = 90¬∞, equality holds. If A = 50¬∞, B = 50¬∞, C = 80¬∞, equality holds.Is there a case where A ‚â† B, A + B ‚â† 90¬∞, yet cosA + sinA = cosB + sinB? Let's try A = 0¬∞, B = 0¬∞, but that's not a triangle. A = 10¬∞, B = 80¬∞, then A + B = 90¬∞, so C = 90¬∞, and equality holds. If A = 10¬∞, B = 10¬∞, then C = 160¬∞, and equality holds.Wait, so it seems that whenever A = B, regardless of C, equality holds. And when A + B = 90¬∞, which is C = 90¬∞, equality also holds. So, the equality holds in two cases: when A = B or when A + B = 90¬∞. Therefore, if the equality holds, it could be because A = B or because A + B = 90¬∞, which is C = 90¬∞. So, the equality is true in more cases than just C = 90¬∞, which means it's not sufficient to conclude C = 90¬∞, but it is necessary because whenever C = 90¬∞, the equality holds.Therefore, my initial conclusion seems correct: the condition is necessary but not sufficient.I think that's solid. I don't see any other cases where the equality would hold without either A = B or A + B = 90¬∞. So, yeah, the answer is B."},{"question":"Given sin alpha=3sin left(alpha+ frac {pi}{6}right), find the value of tan left(alpha+ frac {pi}{12}right).","answer":"Alright, so I have this trigonometry problem here: Given that sin Œ± equals three times sin(Œ± + œÄ/6), I need to find the value of tan(Œ± + œÄ/12). Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this step by step.First off, I know that when dealing with equations involving sine and angles, it might be helpful to use some trigonometric identities. Specifically, the sine addition formula could be useful here. The formula is sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So, maybe I can apply that to the right side of the equation.Let me write down the given equation:sin Œ± = 3 sin(Œ± + œÄ/6)Now, applying the sine addition formula to sin(Œ± + œÄ/6):sin(Œ± + œÄ/6) = sin Œ± cos(œÄ/6) + cos Œ± sin(œÄ/6)I remember that cos(œÄ/6) is ‚àö3/2 and sin(œÄ/6) is 1/2. So substituting those values in:sin(Œ± + œÄ/6) = sin Œ± * (‚àö3/2) + cos Œ± * (1/2)Now, plugging this back into the original equation:sin Œ± = 3 [ (‚àö3/2) sin Œ± + (1/2) cos Œ± ]Let me distribute the 3 on the right side:sin Œ± = (3‚àö3/2) sin Œ± + (3/2) cos Œ±Hmm, okay, so now I have an equation with sin Œ± and cos Œ±. Maybe I can get all the terms involving sin Œ± on one side and the cos Œ± terms on the other. Let me subtract (3‚àö3/2) sin Œ± from both sides:sin Œ± - (3‚àö3/2) sin Œ± = (3/2) cos Œ±Factor out sin Œ± on the left:sin Œ± [1 - (3‚àö3/2)] = (3/2) cos Œ±Let me compute the coefficient on the left:1 - (3‚àö3/2) = (2/2 - 3‚àö3/2) = (2 - 3‚àö3)/2So, the equation becomes:sin Œ± * (2 - 3‚àö3)/2 = (3/2) cos Œ±Now, to make this simpler, let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominators:sin Œ± (2 - 3‚àö3) = 3 cos Œ±Now, if I divide both sides by cos Œ±, I can express this in terms of tan Œ±:tan Œ± (2 - 3‚àö3) = 3So, solving for tan Œ±:tan Œ± = 3 / (2 - 3‚àö3)Hmm, that looks a bit messy with the radical in the denominator. Maybe I should rationalize the denominator. To do that, I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (2 + 3‚àö3):tan Œ± = [3 * (2 + 3‚àö3)] / [(2 - 3‚àö3)(2 + 3‚àö3)]Let me compute the denominator first. It's a difference of squares:(2)^2 - (3‚àö3)^2 = 4 - 9*3 = 4 - 27 = -23So, the denominator is -23. Now, the numerator:3*(2 + 3‚àö3) = 6 + 9‚àö3Therefore, tan Œ± = (6 + 9‚àö3)/(-23) = -(6 + 9‚àö3)/23Hmm, that simplifies to:tan Œ± = (-6 - 9‚àö3)/23I can factor out a 3 from the numerator:tan Œ± = 3*(-2 - 3‚àö3)/23 = (-6 - 9‚àö3)/23Okay, so tan Œ± is (-6 - 9‚àö3)/23. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe it's correct. Let me double-check my steps.Starting from sin Œ± = 3 sin(Œ± + œÄ/6), expanded using sine addition formula, substituted the known sine and cosine values, rearranged terms, and ended up with tan Œ± = 3/(2 - 3‚àö3), which after rationalizing became (-6 - 9‚àö3)/23. Hmm, seems consistent.Now, the next part is to find tan(Œ± + œÄ/12). Again, I can use the tangent addition formula:tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)So, in this case, A is Œ± and B is œÄ/12. So:tan(Œ± + œÄ/12) = [tan Œ± + tan(œÄ/12)] / [1 - tan Œ± tan(œÄ/12)]I already have tan Œ±, so I just need to find tan(œÄ/12). I know that œÄ/12 is 15 degrees, and tan(15¬∞) is a known value. Alternatively, I can express œÄ/12 as œÄ/3 - œÄ/4, since œÄ/3 is 60 degrees and œÄ/4 is 45 degrees, so their difference is 15 degrees.Using the tangent subtraction formula:tan(œÄ/3 - œÄ/4) = [tan(œÄ/3) - tan(œÄ/4)] / [1 + tan(œÄ/3) tan(œÄ/4)]I know that tan(œÄ/3) is ‚àö3 and tan(œÄ/4) is 1. So plugging those in:tan(œÄ/12) = (‚àö3 - 1) / [1 + ‚àö3*1] = (‚àö3 - 1)/(1 + ‚àö3)Again, this has a radical in the denominator, so let's rationalize it by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 - ‚àö3):tan(œÄ/12) = [(‚àö3 - 1)(1 - ‚àö3)] / [(1 + ‚àö3)(1 - ‚àö3)]Compute the denominator first:(1)^2 - (‚àö3)^2 = 1 - 3 = -2Now, the numerator:(‚àö3 - 1)(1 - ‚àö3) = ‚àö3*1 - ‚àö3*‚àö3 -1*1 +1*‚àö3 = ‚àö3 - 3 -1 + ‚àö3 = 2‚àö3 - 4So, tan(œÄ/12) = (2‚àö3 - 4)/(-2) = (-2‚àö3 + 4)/2 = (-‚àö3 + 2) = 2 - ‚àö3Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the multiplication again:(‚àö3 - 1)(1 - ‚àö3) = ‚àö3*1 + ‚àö3*(-‚àö3) -1*1 + (-1)*(-‚àö3) = ‚àö3 - 3 -1 + ‚àö3 = 2‚àö3 -4Yes, that's correct. So numerator is 2‚àö3 -4, denominator is -2, so:(2‚àö3 -4)/(-2) = (-2‚àö3 +4)/2 = (-‚àö3 +2) = 2 - ‚àö3Yes, that's correct. So tan(œÄ/12) is 2 - ‚àö3.Okay, so now I have tan Œ± = (-6 -9‚àö3)/23 and tan(œÄ/12) = 2 - ‚àö3.Now, plug these into the tangent addition formula:tan(Œ± + œÄ/12) = [tan Œ± + tan(œÄ/12)] / [1 - tan Œ± tan(œÄ/12)]Let me compute the numerator first:tan Œ± + tan(œÄ/12) = [(-6 -9‚àö3)/23] + (2 - ‚àö3)To add these, I need a common denominator. Let's express 2 - ‚àö3 as (2 - ‚àö3)*23/23:= [(-6 -9‚àö3) + (2 - ‚àö3)*23] / 23Compute (2 - ‚àö3)*23:= 46 - 23‚àö3So, numerator becomes:(-6 -9‚àö3) + 46 -23‚àö3 = (-6 +46) + (-9‚àö3 -23‚àö3) = 40 -32‚àö3So, numerator is (40 -32‚àö3)/23Now, the denominator of the addition formula is:1 - tan Œ± tan(œÄ/12) = 1 - [(-6 -9‚àö3)/23]*(2 - ‚àö3)First, compute the product:[(-6 -9‚àö3)/23]*(2 - ‚àö3) = [(-6)(2) + (-6)(-‚àö3) + (-9‚àö3)(2) + (-9‚àö3)(-‚àö3)] /23Compute each term:-6*2 = -12-6*(-‚àö3) = 6‚àö3-9‚àö3*2 = -18‚àö3-9‚àö3*(-‚àö3) = 9*(‚àö3)^2 = 9*3 =27So, adding these up:-12 +6‚àö3 -18‚àö3 +27 = (-12 +27) + (6‚àö3 -18‚àö3) =15 -12‚àö3So, the product is (15 -12‚àö3)/23Therefore, the denominator of the addition formula is:1 - (15 -12‚àö3)/23 = (23/23) - (15 -12‚àö3)/23 = [23 -15 +12‚àö3]/23 = (8 +12‚àö3)/23So, putting it all together:tan(Œ± + œÄ/12) = [ (40 -32‚àö3)/23 ] / [ (8 +12‚àö3)/23 ] = (40 -32‚àö3)/23 * 23/(8 +12‚àö3) = (40 -32‚àö3)/(8 +12‚àö3)The 23s cancel out.Now, let's simplify (40 -32‚àö3)/(8 +12‚àö3). Maybe factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 40 -32‚àö3 = 8*(5) - 8*(4‚àö3) = 8*(5 -4‚àö3)Denominator:8 +12‚àö3 = 4*(2) +4*(3‚àö3) =4*(2 +3‚àö3)Wait, actually, 8 +12‚àö3 can be factored as 4*(2 +3‚àö3). Similarly, 40 -32‚àö3 can be factored as 8*(5 -4‚àö3). Hmm, but 8 and 4 have a common factor of 4, so maybe factor 4 out:Numerator: 40 -32‚àö3 = 4*(10 -8‚àö3)Denominator:8 +12‚àö3 =4*(2 +3‚àö3)So, now we have:[4*(10 -8‚àö3)] / [4*(2 +3‚àö3)] = (10 -8‚àö3)/(2 +3‚àö3)The 4s cancel out.Now, let's rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (2 -3‚àö3):(10 -8‚àö3)(2 -3‚àö3) / [(2 +3‚àö3)(2 -3‚àö3)]Compute denominator first:(2)^2 - (3‚àö3)^2 =4 -9*3=4-27=-23Now, numerator:(10)(2) +10*(-3‚àö3) + (-8‚àö3)(2) + (-8‚àö3)(-3‚àö3)=20 -30‚àö3 -16‚àö3 +24*(‚àö3)^2=20 -46‚àö3 +24*3=20 -46‚àö3 +72=92 -46‚àö3So, numerator is 92 -46‚àö3, denominator is -23Therefore, (92 -46‚àö3)/(-23) = (-92 +46‚àö3)/23 = (-92/23) + (46‚àö3)/23 = -4 +2‚àö3So, tan(Œ± + œÄ/12) = -4 +2‚àö3, which can be written as 2‚àö3 -4.Let me just verify if this makes sense. Starting from tan Œ± = (-6 -9‚àö3)/23, which is a negative value, and tan(œÄ/12)=2 -‚àö3, which is approximately 2 -1.732=0.2679, a positive value. So, adding a negative and a positive, but the result is 2‚àö3 -4, which is approximately 3.464 -4= -0.536, which is negative. That seems plausible.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere. Let me check the steps again.When I computed tan(œÄ/12), I got 2 -‚àö3, which is correct.Then, in the numerator of the addition formula, I had [(-6 -9‚àö3)/23 + (2 -‚àö3)] which I converted to [(-6 -9‚àö3) + (46 -23‚àö3)]/23 = (40 -32‚àö3)/23, which seems correct.Denominator was 1 - [(-6 -9‚àö3)/23*(2 -‚àö3)] which became 1 - (15 -12‚àö3)/23 = (8 +12‚àö3)/23, correct.Then, when simplifying (40 -32‚àö3)/(8 +12‚àö3), I factored out 4 from numerator and denominator, getting (10 -8‚àö3)/(2 +3‚àö3). Then multiplied numerator and denominator by (2 -3‚àö3), resulting in (92 -46‚àö3)/(-23)= -4 +2‚àö3.Yes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 2‚àö3 -4.I think that's correct. So, tan(Œ± + œÄ/12)=2‚àö3 -4."},{"question":"Given three numbers (2), (sqrt{2}), and (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}), select any two numbers (a) and (b) (where (a > b)), and replace (a) and (b) with (frac{a+b}{sqrt{2}}) and (frac{a-b}{sqrt{2}}). Can this process transform the numbers into (1), (sqrt{2}), and (1 + sqrt{2}) in a finite number of steps?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given three numbers: 2, ‚àö2, and 1/‚àö2. The task is to see if I can transform these numbers into 1, ‚àö2, and 1 + ‚àö2 by repeatedly performing a specific operation. The operation is to pick any two numbers, say a and b, where a is greater than b, and then replace them with (a + b)/‚àö2 and (a - b)/‚àö2. First, I need to understand what this operation does. It seems like it's some kind of transformation that combines the two numbers in a specific way. Maybe it's related to linear algebra or some kind of vector transformation? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to work through it step by step.Let me write down the initial numbers: 2, ‚àö2, and 1/‚àö2. I need to see if I can get to 1, ‚àö2, and 1 + ‚àö2. One thing I notice is that ‚àö2 is already in both the initial and target sets, so maybe that number doesn't need to be changed. That might simplify things a bit.Now, let's think about the operation. If I pick two numbers, say a and b, and replace them with (a + b)/‚àö2 and (a - b)/‚àö2, what does that do to the set of numbers? It seems like it's creating two new numbers based on the sum and difference of the original two, scaled by 1/‚àö2. I wonder if there's some invariant here, something that doesn't change no matter how many times I perform this operation. Invariants are really useful in problems like this because they can tell us whether a certain transformation is possible or not.Let me calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers before and after the operation to see if that's an invariant. Starting with the initial numbers: 2, ‚àö2, and 1/‚àö2.Sum of squares initially:2¬≤ + (‚àö2)¬≤ + (1/‚àö2)¬≤ = 4 + 2 + (1/2) = 6.5Now, let's perform the operation on two numbers and see what the sum of squares becomes. Suppose I pick 2 and ‚àö2. Then, the new numbers would be:(2 + ‚àö2)/‚àö2 and (2 - ‚àö2)/‚àö2Let me compute these:(2 + ‚àö2)/‚àö2 = 2/‚àö2 + ‚àö2/‚àö2 = ‚àö2 + 1(2 - ‚àö2)/‚àö2 = 2/‚àö2 - ‚àö2/‚àö2 = ‚àö2 - 1So now, the three numbers are ‚àö2 + 1, ‚àö2 - 1, and 1/‚àö2.Let's compute the sum of squares now:(‚àö2 + 1)¬≤ + (‚àö2 - 1)¬≤ + (1/‚àö2)¬≤First, expand (‚àö2 + 1)¬≤:(‚àö2)¬≤ + 2*‚àö2*1 + 1¬≤ = 2 + 2‚àö2 + 1 = 3 + 2‚àö2Similarly, (‚àö2 - 1)¬≤:(‚àö2)¬≤ - 2*‚àö2*1 + 1¬≤ = 2 - 2‚àö2 + 1 = 3 - 2‚àö2And (1/‚àö2)¬≤ = 1/2So, adding them up:(3 + 2‚àö2) + (3 - 2‚àö2) + 1/2 = 6 + 1/2 = 6.5Interesting! The sum of squares remains the same after the operation. So, the sum of squares is an invariant. That means no matter how many times I perform this operation, the sum of the squares of the three numbers will always be 6.5.Now, let's check the sum of squares for the target numbers: 1, ‚àö2, and 1 + ‚àö2.Sum of squares target:1¬≤ + (‚àö2)¬≤ + (1 + ‚àö2)¬≤ = 1 + 2 + (1 + 2‚àö2 + 2) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2‚àö2 = 6 + 2‚àö2Wait a minute, 6 + 2‚àö2 is approximately 6 + 2.828 = 8.828, which is different from 6.5. So, the sum of squares for the initial set is 6.5, and for the target set, it's 6 + 2‚àö2, which is approximately 8.828. Since these are different, it means that it's impossible to reach the target set from the initial set using this operation because the sum of squares is an invariant and doesn't change.Therefore, the answer is no, it's not possible to transform the numbers into 1, ‚àö2, and 1 + ‚àö2 in a finite number of steps.But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Initial sum of squares:2¬≤ = 4(‚àö2)¬≤ = 2(1/‚àö2)¬≤ = 1/2Total: 4 + 2 + 0.5 = 6.5Target sum of squares:1¬≤ = 1(‚àö2)¬≤ = 2(1 + ‚àö2)¬≤ = 1 + 2‚àö2 + 2 = 3 + 2‚àö2Total: 1 + 2 + 3 + 2‚àö2 = 6 + 2‚àö2Yes, that's correct. 6.5 is not equal to 6 + 2‚àö2, so the invariant doesn't match. Therefore, the transformation is impossible.I think that's solid reasoning. The key was identifying the invariant, which in this case was the sum of the squares of the numbers. Since the invariant doesn't match between the initial and target sets, the transformation can't be achieved."},{"question":"in a division , divident is 689 , divisior is 36 and quotient is 19 . find the remainder .","answer":"First, I need to find the remainder when 689 is divided by 36 with a quotient of 19.I'll start by calculating the product of the divisor and the quotient: 36 multiplied by 19 equals 684.Next, I'll subtract this product from the dividend to determine the remainder: 689 minus 684 equals 5.Therefore, the remainder is 5."},{"question":"Show that(x-a)^{2}(b-c)+(x-b)^{2}(c-a)+(x-c)^{2}(a-b)can be factored into a product of three linear terms independent of ( x ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this expression: (x - a)^2(b - c) + (x - b)^2(c - a) + (x - c)^2(a - b)And I need to show that it can be factored into a product of three linear terms that don't depend on (x). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, maybe I should expand each term to see if something cancels out or simplifies. Let's start by expanding each squared term:1. Expand ((x - a)^2):   (x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^22. Multiply by ((b - c)):   (x^2 - 2ax + a^2)(b - c) = x^2(b - c) - 2ax(b - c) + a^2(b - c)3. Similarly, expand ((x - b)^2):   (x - b)^2 = x^2 - 2bx + b^24. Multiply by ((c - a)):   (x^2 - 2bx + b^2)(c - a) = x^2(c - a) - 2bx(c - a) + b^2(c - a)5. Expand ((x - c)^2):   (x - c)^2 = x^2 - 2cx + c^26. Multiply by ((a - b)):   (x^2 - 2cx + c^2)(a - b) = x^2(a - b) - 2cx(a - b) + c^2(a - b)Now, let's add all these expanded terms together:begin{align*}&x^2(b - c) - 2ax(b - c) + a^2(b - c) &+ x^2(c - a) - 2bx(c - a) + b^2(c - a) &+ x^2(a - b) - 2cx(a - b) + c^2(a - b)end{align*}Let me group the like terms together. First, the (x^2) terms:x^2(b - c) + x^2(c - a) + x^2(a - b)Let me factor out (x^2):x^2[(b - c) + (c - a) + (a - b)]Simplify inside the brackets:(b - c) + (c - a) + (a - b) = b - c + c - a + a - b = 0So, the (x^2) terms cancel out. That's nice.Next, the linear terms in (x):-2ax(b - c) - 2bx(c - a) - 2cx(a - b)Factor out (-2x):-2x[a(b - c) + b(c - a) + c(a - b)]Let me simplify the expression inside the brackets:First, expand each term:1. (a(b - c) = ab - ac)2. (b(c - a) = bc - ab)3. (c(a - b) = ac - bc)Now, add them together:(ab - ac) + (bc - ab) + (ac - bc)Combine like terms:- (ab - ab = 0)- (-ac + ac = 0)- (bc - bc = 0)So, everything cancels out again! The linear terms also sum to zero.That leaves us with the constant terms:a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b)Hmm, this is a bit more complicated. Let me see if I can factor this expression.First, notice that each term has a squared variable multiplied by a difference. Maybe I can factor by grouping or look for common factors.Let me write it out again:a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b)I can factor out ((b - c)) from the first term, ((c - a)) from the second, and ((a - b)) from the third. Wait, but that's how it's already written. Maybe I need to rearrange or factor differently.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out ((a - b)(b - c)(c - a)) somehow. Let me check.Let me consider the expression:a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b)Let me factor out ((a - b)) from the first two terms:Wait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, let me try to factor each term:1. (a^2(b - c) = a^2b - a^2c)2. (b^2(c - a) = b^2c - b^2a)3. (c^2(a - b) = c^2a - c^2b)Now, let me write all the terms:a^2b - a^2c + b^2c - b^2a + c^2a - c^2bLet me rearrange the terms to group similar ones:- Terms with (ab): (a^2b - b^2a)- Terms with (ac): (-a^2c + c^2a)- Terms with (bc): (b^2c - c^2b)Factor each group:1. (a^2b - b^2a = ab(a - b))2. (-a^2c + c^2a = ac(-a + c) = ac(c - a))3. (b^2c - c^2b = bc(b - c))So now, the expression becomes:ab(a - b) + ac(c - a) + bc(b - c)Hmm, this still doesn't look like a product of three linear terms. Maybe I need another approach.Wait, let me think about symmetric functions or cyclic sums. The original expression is cyclic in (a), (b), and (c). Maybe I can use that symmetry to factor it.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out ((a - b)(b - c)(c - a)). Let me see.Let me consider the expression:(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)If I expand this, what do I get?First, multiply ((a - b)(b - c)):(a - b)(b - c) = ab - a c - b^2 + b cNow, multiply by ((c - a)):(ab - a c - b^2 + b c)(c - a)Let me expand term by term:1. (ab cdot (c - a) = abc - a^2b)2. (-ac cdot (c - a) = -a c^2 + a^2c)3. (-b^2 cdot (c - a) = -b^2c + a b^2)4. (bc cdot (c - a) = b c^2 - a b c)Now, add all these together:abc - a^2b - a c^2 + a^2c - b^2c + a b^2 + b c^2 - a b cSimplify:- (abc - abc = 0)- (-a^2b + a b^2 = ab(-a + b))- (-a c^2 + b c^2 = c^2(-a + b))- (a^2c - b^2c = c(a^2 - b^2) = c(a - b)(a + b))Wait, this seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in expanding. Let me double-check.Wait, actually, when I expand ((a - b)(b - c)(c - a)), it's equal to (-(a - b)(b - c)(a - c)), which is a standard symmetric expression. But perhaps I should relate it to the original expression.Wait, going back to the original expression:After expanding and simplifying, we ended up with:a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b)Which is equal to:-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)Wait, is that true? Let me check.Let me compute (-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)):First, compute ((a - b)(b - c)):(a - b)(b - c) = ab - a c - b^2 + b cThen multiply by ((c - a)):Wait, no, actually, (-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)) is equal to ((a - b)(b - c)(a - c)), which is the same as the expression we had earlier.But in our case, we have:a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b)Let me see if this is equal to (-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)).Let me compute (-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)):First, note that ((c - a) = -(a - c)), so:-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a) = -(a - b)(b - c)(-1)(a - c) = (a - b)(b - c)(a - c)Now, let me expand ((a - b)(b - c)(a - c)):First, multiply ((a - b)(b - c)):(a - b)(b - c) = ab - a c - b^2 + b cNow, multiply by ((a - c)):(ab - a c - b^2 + b c)(a - c)Expanding term by term:1. (ab cdot (a - c) = a^2b - a b c)2. (-a c cdot (a - c) = -a^2c + a c^2)3. (-b^2 cdot (a - c) = -a b^2 + b^2c)4. (b c cdot (a - c) = a b c - b c^2)Now, add all these together:a^2b - a b c - a^2c + a c^2 - a b^2 + b^2c + a b c - b c^2Simplify:- (a^2b - a^2c)- (-a b c + a b c = 0)- (-a b^2 + b^2c)- (a c^2 - b c^2)So, we have:a^2b - a^2c - a b^2 + b^2c + a c^2 - b c^2Factor terms:- (a^2b - a^2c = a^2(b - c))- (-a b^2 + b^2c = b^2(-a + c) = b^2(c - a))- (a c^2 - b c^2 = c^2(a - b))So, putting it all together:a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b)Which is exactly the expression we had after expanding the original expression! Therefore, we have:a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b) = (a - b)(b - c)(a - c)But wait, earlier I thought it was equal to (-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)). Let me check the signs.Actually, ((a - b)(b - c)(a - c)) is equal to (-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)), because ((a - c) = -(c - a)). So,(a - b)(b - c)(a - c) = -(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)Therefore,a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b) = -(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)So, going back to our original expression, after expanding and simplifying, we found that all the (x^2) and linear terms canceled out, leaving us with:a^2(b - c) + b^2(c - a) + c^2(a - b) = -(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)Therefore, the original expression simplifies to:-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)Which is a product of three linear terms: ((a - b)), ((b - c)), and ((c - a)). These terms are independent of (x), as required.So, in conclusion, the given expression can indeed be factored into a product of three linear terms independent of (x), and those terms are (-(a - b)(b - c)(c - a))."},{"question":"The triangle ABC has area k and angle A = Œ∏, and is such that BC is as small as possible. Find the lengths of AB and AC.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about triangle ABC where the area is k and angle A is Œ∏. The goal is to find the lengths of AB and AC such that BC is as small as possible. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I know that in a triangle, the area can be calculated using the formula:[ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times AB times AC times sin(theta) ]Given that the area is k, I can set up the equation:[ k = frac{1}{2} times AB times AC times sin(theta) ]Let me denote AB as c and AC as b for simplicity. So, the equation becomes:[ k = frac{1}{2} times b times c times sin(theta) ]From this, I can solve for the product of b and c:[ b times c = frac{2k}{sin(theta)} ]Okay, so now I have a relationship between b and c. But I need to find the lengths of AB and AC such that BC is minimized. Hmm, how do I express BC in terms of b and c?I remember the Law of Cosines, which relates the sides of a triangle to one of its angles. Specifically, for angle A, it states:[ BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 times AB times AC times cos(theta) ]Substituting AB as c and AC as b, this becomes:[ BC^2 = c^2 + b^2 - 2bc cos(theta) ]So, BC is a function of b and c. I need to minimize BC, which means I need to minimize BC¬≤ as well since the square root function is monotonically increasing.Given that I have the product bc fixed from the area equation, I can think of this as an optimization problem with a constraint. The constraint is:[ bc = frac{2k}{sin(theta)} ]And the function to minimize is:[ BC^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos(theta) ]Hmm, this looks like a problem where I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a simpler way since it's a triangle.Wait, another thought: for a given product bc, the expression b¬≤ + c¬≤ is minimized when b = c. Is that correct? Let me verify.If I fix the product bc, then by the AM-GM inequality, the sum b¬≤ + c¬≤ is minimized when b = c. Yes, that makes sense because the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean, and equality holds when all variables are equal.So, if b = c, then:[ b times b = frac{2k}{sin(theta)} ][ b^2 = frac{2k}{sin(theta)} ][ b = sqrt{frac{2k}{sin(theta)}} ]Therefore, both AB and AC are equal to sqrt(2k / sinŒ∏). That seems logical because making AB and AC equal would make the triangle more \\"balanced,\\" potentially minimizing BC.But let me double-check this reasoning. If I set b = c, then BC¬≤ becomes:[ BC^2 = b^2 + b^2 - 2b^2 cos(theta) ][ BC^2 = 2b^2(1 - cos(theta)) ]Substituting b¬≤ from earlier:[ BC^2 = 2 times frac{2k}{sin(theta)} times (1 - cos(theta)) ][ BC^2 = frac{4k(1 - cos(theta))}{sin(theta)} ]Hmm, that simplifies to:[ BC = sqrt{frac{4k(1 - cos(theta))}{sin(theta)}} ]But I'm not sure if this is the minimal BC. Maybe I should consider calculus to confirm.Let me express BC¬≤ in terms of one variable. Since bc = 2k / sinŒ∏, I can express c = (2k) / (b sinŒ∏). Substituting into BC¬≤:[ BC^2 = b^2 + left(frac{2k}{b sinŒ∏}right)^2 - 2 times b times frac{2k}{b sinŒ∏} times cosŒ∏ ][ BC^2 = b^2 + frac{4k^2}{b^2 sin^2Œ∏} - frac{4k cosŒ∏}{sinŒ∏} ]Now, let's denote f(b) = BC¬≤:[ f(b) = b^2 + frac{4k^2}{b^2 sin^2Œ∏} - frac{4k cosŒ∏}{sinŒ∏} ]To find the minimum, take the derivative of f(b) with respect to b and set it to zero.First, compute f'(b):[ f'(b) = 2b - frac{8k^2}{b^3 sin^2Œ∏} ]Set f'(b) = 0:[ 2b - frac{8k^2}{b^3 sin^2Œ∏} = 0 ][ 2b = frac{8k^2}{b^3 sin^2Œ∏} ][ 2b^4 sin^2Œ∏ = 8k^2 ][ b^4 = frac{8k^2}{2 sin^2Œ∏} ][ b^4 = frac{4k^2}{sin^2Œ∏} ][ b^2 = frac{2k}{sinŒ∏} ][ b = sqrt{frac{2k}{sinŒ∏}} ]So, indeed, the minimum occurs when b = sqrt(2k / sinŒ∏). Therefore, c = b as well, since c = (2k) / (b sinŒ∏) and substituting b gives c = sqrt(2k / sinŒ∏).Therefore, both AB and AC are equal to sqrt(2k / sinŒ∏). This confirms my earlier reasoning.I think this makes sense because when AB and AC are equal, the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC, which often leads to minimal or maximal properties in triangles. In this case, it minimizes BC.Let me just visualize this. If angle A is fixed, and the area is fixed, making AB and AC equal would create a symmetrical triangle, which likely has the shortest possible BC. If AB and AC were unequal, BC might be longer because the triangle would be more stretched out.Also, recalling that for a given area and angle, the minimal side opposite the angle is achieved when the other two sides are equal. This seems consistent with what I've found.So, after going through the algebra and calculus, it's clear that AB and AC should both be sqrt(2k / sinŒ∏) to minimize BC.**Final Answer**The lengths of AB and AC are both boxed{sqrt{dfrac{2k}{sin theta}}}."},{"question":"find k if 64 / k = 8 .","answer":"First, I need to solve the equation ( frac{64}{k} = 8 ) for ( k ).To isolate ( k ), I can multiply both sides of the equation by ( k ):[ 64 = 8k ]Next, I divide both sides by 8 to solve for ( k ):[ frac{64}{8} = frac{8k}{8} ][ 8 = k ]Therefore, the value of ( k ) is 8."},{"question":"Given the ellipse G: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > b > 0) with an eccentricity e= frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, and its right vertex at (sqrt{3},0).(1) Find the equation of G;(2) The line y=kx+1 intersects the curve G at two distinct points A and B. If there exists a point M on the x-axis such that |AM|=|BM|, find the range of values for the x-coordinate of point M.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about an ellipse, and I need to solve two parts. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.First, the ellipse G is given by the equation (frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), where (a > b > 0). The eccentricity (e) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{3}), and the right vertex is at ((sqrt{3}, 0)). Part (1) asks for the equation of G. Okay, so I need to find (a) and (b) to write the equation. I know that for an ellipse, the eccentricity (e) is given by (e = frac{c}{a}), where (c) is the distance from the center to each focus. Also, the relationship between (a), (b), and (c) is (c^2 = a^2 - b^2).Given that the right vertex is at ((sqrt{3}, 0)), this means that the center of the ellipse is at the origin (since the vertex is on the x-axis), and (a = sqrt{3}). So, (a = sqrt{3}).Now, the eccentricity (e = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}). Since (e = frac{c}{a}), plugging in the known values:[frac{sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{c}{sqrt{3}}]Solving for (c):[c = sqrt{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{3}{3} = 1]So, (c = 1). Now, using the relationship (c^2 = a^2 - b^2):[1^2 = (sqrt{3})^2 - b^2 1 = 3 - b^2 b^2 = 3 - 1 = 2]Therefore, (b = sqrt{2}). Now, plugging (a^2 = 3) and (b^2 = 2) into the standard equation of the ellipse:[frac{x^2}{3} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1]So, that should be the equation of G.Moving on to part (2). The line (y = kx + 1) intersects the ellipse G at two distinct points A and B. There exists a point M on the x-axis such that (|AM| = |BM|). I need to find the range of values for the x-coordinate of point M.Hmm, okay. So, point M is on the x-axis, so its coordinates are ((m, 0)). The condition (|AM| = |BM|) implies that M is equidistant from A and B. In other words, M lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AB.Since A and B are points of intersection between the line and the ellipse, I can find their coordinates by solving the system of equations:1. (frac{x^2}{3} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1)2. (y = kx + 1)Let me substitute equation 2 into equation 1:[frac{x^2}{3} + frac{(kx + 1)^2}{2} = 1]Expanding the numerator:[frac{x^2}{3} + frac{k^2x^2 + 2kx + 1}{2} = 1]To eliminate denominators, let's multiply both sides by 6 (the least common multiple of 3 and 2):[2x^2 + 3(k^2x^2 + 2kx + 1) = 6]Expanding:[2x^2 + 3k^2x^2 + 6kx + 3 = 6]Combine like terms:[(2 + 3k^2)x^2 + 6kx + (3 - 6) = 0 (2 + 3k^2)x^2 + 6kx - 3 = 0]So, we have a quadratic in x:[(3k^2 + 2)x^2 + 6kx - 3 = 0]Let me denote this as:[A x^2 + B x + C = 0]where (A = 3k^2 + 2), (B = 6k), and (C = -3).Let the roots be (x_1) and (x_2), corresponding to points A and B. Then, from Vieta's formulas:[x_1 + x_2 = -frac{B}{A} = -frac{6k}{3k^2 + 2}][x_1 x_2 = frac{C}{A} = -frac{3}{3k^2 + 2}]The midpoint N of AB will have coordinates:[x_N = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = -frac{3k}{3k^2 + 2}][y_N = k x_N + 1 = k left(-frac{3k}{3k^2 + 2}right) + 1 = -frac{3k^2}{3k^2 + 2} + 1 = frac{-3k^2 + 3k^2 + 2}{3k^2 + 2} = frac{2}{3k^2 + 2}]So, midpoint N is (left(-frac{3k}{3k^2 + 2}, frac{2}{3k^2 + 2}right)).Since M is on the x-axis and is equidistant from A and B, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. The perpendicular bisector passes through the midpoint N and has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.The slope of AB is k, so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is (-1/k).Therefore, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:[y - y_N = -frac{1}{k}(x - x_N)]Since M lies on this line and on the x-axis (where y = 0), substitute y = 0 into the equation:[0 - y_N = -frac{1}{k}(x - x_N)][- y_N = -frac{1}{k}x + frac{x_N}{k}][- y_N = -frac{1}{k}x + frac{x_N}{k}][frac{1}{k}x = frac{x_N}{k} + y_N][x = x_N + k y_N]Plugging in the values of (x_N) and (y_N):[x = -frac{3k}{3k^2 + 2} + k left(frac{2}{3k^2 + 2}right)][x = -frac{3k}{3k^2 + 2} + frac{2k}{3k^2 + 2}][x = frac{-3k + 2k}{3k^2 + 2}][x = frac{-k}{3k^2 + 2}]So, the x-coordinate of M is (m = frac{-k}{3k^2 + 2}).Now, I need to find the range of m. That is, I need to find all possible values of m as k varies over all real numbers (except where the line is tangent, but since the line intersects at two points, the discriminant must be positive).Wait, actually, the line intersects the ellipse at two distinct points, so the quadratic equation we had earlier must have two distinct real roots. So, discriminant D > 0.The discriminant D of (A x^2 + B x + C = 0) is:[D = B^2 - 4AC = (6k)^2 - 4(3k^2 + 2)(-3)][D = 36k^2 - 4(3k^2 + 2)(-3)][D = 36k^2 + 12(3k^2 + 2)][D = 36k^2 + 36k^2 + 24][D = 72k^2 + 24]Since (72k^2 + 24) is always positive for all real k, the line always intersects the ellipse at two distinct points. So, k can be any real number.Therefore, m can be expressed as:[m = frac{-k}{3k^2 + 2}]I need to find the range of m as k varies over all real numbers.Let me denote (m = frac{-k}{3k^2 + 2}). Let's consider m as a function of k:[m(k) = frac{-k}{3k^2 + 2}]To find the range, I can analyze this function. Let's consider m as a function and find its maximum and minimum values.Alternatively, I can set (m = frac{-k}{3k^2 + 2}) and solve for k in terms of m, then find the values of m for which real solutions k exist.Let me try this approach.Starting with:[m = frac{-k}{3k^2 + 2}]Multiply both sides by (3k^2 + 2):[m(3k^2 + 2) = -k][3m k^2 + 2m = -k][3m k^2 + k + 2m = 0]This is a quadratic equation in k:[3m k^2 + k + 2m = 0]For real solutions k to exist, the discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative.Discriminant D:[D = (1)^2 - 4(3m)(2m) = 1 - 24m^2]For real k, D ‚â• 0:[1 - 24m^2 ‚â• 0][24m^2 ‚â§ 1][m^2 ‚â§ frac{1}{24}][|m| ‚â§ frac{1}{sqrt{24}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{12}]Therefore, the range of m is:[-frac{sqrt{6}}{12} ‚â§ m ‚â§ frac{sqrt{6}}{12}]So, the x-coordinate of point M lies in the interval (left[-frac{sqrt{6}}{12}, frac{sqrt{6}}{12}right]).Let me just verify this result. If I take m at its maximum positive value, (frac{sqrt{6}}{12}), and solve for k, I should get a real k.Plugging (m = frac{sqrt{6}}{12}) into the quadratic equation:[3 times frac{sqrt{6}}{12} k^2 + k + 2 times frac{sqrt{6}}{12} = 0][frac{sqrt{6}}{4} k^2 + k + frac{sqrt{6}}{6} = 0]Multiply through by 12 to eliminate denominators:[3sqrt{6} k^2 + 12k + 2sqrt{6} = 0]Compute discriminant:[D = 12^2 - 4 times 3sqrt{6} times 2sqrt{6} = 144 - 4 times 3sqrt{6} times 2sqrt{6}][D = 144 - 4 times 6 times 6 = 144 - 144 = 0]So, discriminant is zero, which means there is exactly one real solution for k, which is consistent with m being at its maximum.Similarly, for (m = -frac{sqrt{6}}{12}), the discriminant will also be zero, giving one real solution for k.Therefore, the range of m is indeed (left[-frac{sqrt{6}}{12}, frac{sqrt{6}}{12}right]).**Final Answer**(1) The equation of ellipse (G) is (boxed{dfrac{x^2}{3} + dfrac{y^2}{2} = 1}).(2) The range of values for the x-coordinate of point (M) is (boxed{left[ -dfrac{sqrt{6}}{12}, dfrac{sqrt{6}}{12} right]})."},{"question":"Given that the sum of the first n terms of a sequence {a_{n}} is S_{n}, and it satisfies S_{n}=2a_{n}-2^{n}, nin N^{*}, then which of the following statements is true?A: a_{1}=2B: a_{2}=6C: The sequence {frac{a_n}{2^n}} is an arithmetic sequenceD: {a_{n}+1} is a geometric sequence","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where the sum of the first n terms of a sequence {a_n} is given by S_n, and it satisfies the equation S_n = 2a_n - 2^n for n in natural numbers. I need to figure out which of the statements A, B, C, D are true.First, let me understand what's given. The sum of the first n terms is S_n, which is equal to twice the nth term minus 2 to the power n. So, S_n = 2a_n - 2^n.I think I should start by finding an expression for a_n in terms of S_n. Since S_n is the sum of the first n terms, I know that S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n. Also, S_{n-1} would be the sum of the first (n-1) terms, so S_{n-1} = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n-1}. Therefore, the nth term a_n can be found by subtracting S_{n-1} from S_n: a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}.Given that S_n = 2a_n - 2^n, I can write S_{n-1} similarly: S_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} - 2^{n-1}.So, substituting these into the expression for a_n:a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = (2a_n - 2^n) - (2a_{n-1} - 2^{n-1}).Let me simplify this:a_n = 2a_n - 2^n - 2a_{n-1} + 2^{n-1}Bring the 2a_n to the left side:a_n - 2a_n = -2^n + 2^{n-1} - 2a_{n-1}This simplifies to:- a_n = -2^n + 2^{n-1} - 2a_{n-1}Multiply both sides by -1:a_n = 2^n - 2^{n-1} + 2a_{n-1}Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out 2^{n-1}:a_n = 2^{n-1}(2 - 1) + 2a_{n-1} = 2^{n-1} + 2a_{n-1}So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 2^{n-1}.This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. I think I can solve this using standard techniques.First, let me write the homogeneous part: a_n - 2a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 2 = 0, so r = 2. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is A*2^n.Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 2^{n-1}, which is similar to the homogeneous solution, I need to multiply by n to find a particular solution. Let me assume a particular solution of the form B*n*2^n.Substitute this into the recurrence:B*n*2^n - 2*B*(n-1)*2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}Simplify the left side:B*n*2^n - 2*B*(n-1)*2^{n-1} = B*n*2^n - B*(n-1)*2^n = B*2^n (n - (n - 1)) = B*2^n (1) = B*2^nSet this equal to the right side, which is 2^{n-1}:B*2^n = 2^{n-1}Divide both sides by 2^{n-1}:B*2 = 1 => B = 1/2Therefore, the general solution is:a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*2^n + (1/2)*n*2^n = A*2^n + n*2^{n-1}Now, I need to find the constant A using the initial condition. Let's find a_1.When n=1, S_1 = a_1 = 2a_1 - 2^1 => a_1 = 2a_1 - 2 => 0 = a_1 - 2 => a_1 = 2.So, a_1 = 2. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution:a_1 = A*2^1 + 1*2^{0} = 2A + 1 = 2So, 2A + 1 = 2 => 2A = 1 => A = 1/2.Therefore, the general term is:a_n = (1/2)*2^n + n*2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1} + n*2^{n-1} = (n + 1)*2^{n-1}So, a_n = (n + 1)*2^{n - 1}Now, let's check the options:A: a_1 = 2. From above, a_1 = 2, so A is correct.B: a_2 = 6. Let's compute a_2:a_2 = (2 + 1)*2^{2 - 1} = 3*2 = 6. So, B is correct.C: The sequence {a_n / 2^n} is an arithmetic sequence.Let's compute a_n / 2^n:a_n / 2^n = [(n + 1)*2^{n - 1}] / 2^n = (n + 1)/2So, the sequence is (n + 1)/2. Let's see if this is arithmetic.Compute the difference between consecutive terms:For term n+1: (n + 2)/2Difference: (n + 2)/2 - (n + 1)/2 = (n + 2 - n - 1)/2 = 1/2So, the difference is constant (1/2), which means it's an arithmetic sequence. So, C is correct.D: {a_n + 1} is a geometric sequence.Compute a_n + 1:a_n + 1 = (n + 1)*2^{n - 1} + 1Let's see if this is geometric. Let's compute the ratio between consecutive terms.Compute (a_{n+1} + 1)/(a_n + 1):[(n + 2)*2^{n} + 1] / [(n + 1)*2^{n - 1} + 1]This doesn't simplify to a constant ratio. For example, let's compute for n=1:a_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3a_2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7Ratio: 7/3 ‚âà 2.333For n=2:a_2 + 1 = 7a_3 + 1 = (4)*4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17Ratio: 17/7 ‚âà 2.428These ratios are not equal, so it's not a geometric sequence.

There are four options: A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which one correctly shows a factorization. Hmm, factorization means breaking down a polynomial into a product of its factors, right? So, I should look for an expression where the left side is a polynomial, and the right side is that polynomial written as a product of simpler expressions.Let me go through each option one by one.**Option A**: ( x^{2} - x - 1 = x(x - 1) - 1 )Alright, so on the left side, I have a quadratic polynomial ( x^{2} - x - 1 ). On the right side, it's written as ( x(x - 1) - 1 ). Let me see what ( x(x - 1) ) is. If I multiply that out, it's ( x^2 - x ). So, the right side becomes ( x^2 - x - 1 ). Wait, that's exactly the same as the left side. So, they're equal, but is this a factorization?Hmm, factorization should express the polynomial as a product of factors, not just rearrange it. Here, it's still a combination of terms, not a product. So, I don't think this is a factorization. It's more like expanding and then subtracting 1 again. So, probably not a factorization.**Option B**: ( x^2 - 1 = x(x - frac{1}{x}) )Okay, the left side is ( x^2 - 1 ), which I recognize as a difference of squares. The standard factorization for that is ( (x - 1)(x + 1) ). But here, the right side is ( x(x - frac{1}{x}) ). Let me compute that. Multiply ( x ) by ( x ) to get ( x^2 ), and ( x ) times ( -frac{1}{x} ) is ( -1 ). So, the right side simplifies to ( x^2 - 1 ), which matches the left side. But is this a valid factorization?Wait, factorization usually involves polynomials, right? Here, ( x - frac{1}{x} ) is not a polynomial because of the ( frac{1}{x} ) term. Polynomials have non-negative integer exponents, and ( frac{1}{x} ) is like ( x^{-1} ), which is not allowed in polynomials. So, even though the right side equals the left side, it's not a proper factorization because it's not in terms of polynomials. So, I think this is incorrect as a factorization.**Option C**: ( x^{2} - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^{2} )Alright, the left side is ( x^{2} - 2x + 1 ). I remember that this is a perfect square trinomial. Let me check: ( (x - 1)^2 ) expands to ( x^2 - 2x + 1 ), which matches the left side. So, this seems correct. The right side is a product of two identical binomials, which is a factorization. So, this looks good.**Option D**: ( x(x - 1) = x^{2} - x )Here, the left side is ( x(x - 1) ), and the right side is ( x^{2} - x ). If I multiply out the left side, I get ( x^2 - x ), which matches the right side. But is this a factorization?Well, factorization is when you express a polynomial as a product of factors. Here, it's starting from the product ( x(x - 1) ) and expanding it to get ( x^2 - x ). So, this is actually the reverse of factorization‚Äîit's expanding, not factoring.

Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.First, the problem says that we have a group of k people, and for any group of n people, there's an (n+1)-th person who knows all of them. Knowing is mutual, so if A knows B, then B knows A. Part 1 asks me to prove that if k = 2n + 1, there must be a person who knows everyone else. Hmm, okay. So, in a group of 2n + 1 people, no matter which n people I pick, there's someone else who knows all of them. I need to show that under these conditions, there's at least one person who knows all 2n others.Let me think about how to model this. Maybe using graph theory? Yeah, that sounds right. If I represent each person as a vertex in a graph, and draw an edge between two people if they **don't** know each other. So, the absence of an edge means they know each other. So, in this graph, the condition translates to: for any set of n vertices, there exists another vertex connected to all of them. But wait, in my graph, edges represent not knowing, so actually, for any set of n vertices, there's a vertex with no edges connecting it to any of the n vertices. That means this vertex knows all n of them.Now, if I assume the contrary, that there is no person who knows everyone, that would mean every vertex has at least one edge, right? Because if someone knew everyone, they would have no edges connected to them.So, let's suppose that the graph doesn't have any isolated vertices. That is, every person doesn't know at least one other person. Now, I need to find a contradiction here.Maybe I can think about the minimal number of edges in such a graph. If I can show that such a graph must have a certain structure, maybe I can find a contradiction.Wait, if I consider the complement graph, where edges represent knowing each other, then the condition is that every set of n vertices has a common neighbor. So, in the complement graph, every n-vertex set has a common neighbor. That might be easier to think about.In the complement graph, which I'll call G', every n vertices have a common neighbor. So, G' is a graph where any n vertices have at least one common neighbor. I need to show that G' has a vertex connected to all others.This seems similar to some kind of covering condition. Maybe I can use induction or some combinatorial argument.Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. If there are 2n + 1 people, and each person doesn't know at least one person, then how are these non-knowing relationships distributed?Wait, if each person doesn't know at least one other person, then there are at least 2n + 1 non-edges in the graph. But in a graph with 2n + 1 vertices, the total number of possible edges is (2n + 1)(2n)/2, which is a lot. So, having 2n + 1 non-edges is not that many.But how does that help me? Maybe I need to think about the degrees of the vertices. If every vertex has degree at least 1 in the non-knowing graph, then in the complement graph, every vertex has degree at most 2n.But I need to show that there's a vertex with degree 2n in the complement graph, meaning it knows everyone.Hmm, maybe I can use Dirac's theorem or something related to Hamiltonian cycles, but I'm not sure.Wait, another approach: suppose that no one knows everyone. Then, for each person, there's at least one person they don't know. So, for each person, there's at least one non-edge.Now, consider all these non-edges. There are 2n + 1 of them, right? Because each person contributes at least one non-edge.But in a graph with 2n + 1 vertices, the maximum number of non-edges is C(2n + 1, 2). But we're only assuming that there are at least 2n + 1 non-edges.But how does this relate to the condition that every n people have someone who knows all of them?Maybe I can pick a set of n people, and by the condition, there's someone who knows all of them. So, in the complement graph, this person is connected to all n people.But if I assume that no one is connected to everyone, then for any person, there's at least one person they don't know.Wait, maybe I can use induction on n. Let's see.Base case: n = 1. Then k = 3. So, in a group of 3 people, for any single person, there's someone who knows them. So, does that mean someone knows everyone? Well, if n = 1, the condition is that for any single person, there's someone who knows them. So, in a group of 3, if everyone knows at least one person, does that mean someone knows both others? Not necessarily. For example, if it's a cycle: A knows B, B knows C, C knows A. Then, for any single person, there's someone who knows them, but no one knows both others. So, in this case, the conclusion doesn't hold. Hmm, that's a problem.Wait, but n and k are positive integers, so n = 1 is allowed. But in the problem statement, it says \\"for each group of n people, there is an (n+1)-th person that knows them all.\\" So, for n = 1, it's for each single person, there's another person who knows them. So, in the complement graph, for each vertex, there's another vertex connected to it. So, in the complement graph, it's a graph where every vertex has at least one neighbor. So, in the complement graph, it's a graph with no isolated vertices.But in the complement graph, does that imply that there's a vertex connected to everyone? No, as in the cycle example, each vertex has degree 2, but no vertex is connected to everyone.Wait, but in the original problem, when n = 1, k = 3. So, in the original graph, which represents non-knowing, it's a graph with 3 vertices and no isolated vertices. So, it could be a triangle, meaning everyone doesn't know each other, which contradicts the condition because for any single person, there should be someone who knows them, but in this case, no one knows anyone. So, actually, the complement graph can't be a triangle because that would mean in the original graph, everyone knows each other, which is the opposite.Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.In the original problem, the graph G represents people who don't know each other. So, if G is a triangle, that would mean everyone doesn't know each other, which would violate the condition because for any single person, there should be someone who knows them, but in this case, no one knows anyone. So, actually, G cannot be a triangle. So, for n = 1, k = 3, the complement graph must have no isolated vertices, meaning in G, every vertex has at least one non-edge.But in G, which has 3 vertices, if every vertex has at least one non-edge, then G must have at least 3 non-edges, but in a 3-vertex graph, there are only 3 possible edges. So, G would have to be the empty graph, meaning everyone knows each other, which contradicts the assumption that G has no isolated vertices.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe n = 1 is a special case. Let me try n = 2, k = 5.So, in a group of 5 people, for any 2 people, there's a third person who knows both of them. I need to show that there's someone who knows all 4 others.Hmm, okay. Maybe I can use some combinatorial argument here. If no one knows everyone, then each person doesn't know at least one person. So, for each person, there's at least one person they don't know.Now, consider all these non-knowing relationships. There are 5 people, so at least 5 non-edges in G.But in a 5-vertex graph, the total number of edges is 10, so 5 non-edges is possible.But how does this relate to the condition that any 2 people have a common knower?Wait, if I pick any 2 people, there's a third person who knows both. So, in the complement graph, any two vertices have a common neighbor.So, in the complement graph G', which is a graph on 5 vertices where any two vertices have a common neighbor, I need to show that G' has a vertex connected to all others.Is that necessarily true? Let me think.In G', if any two vertices have a common neighbor, does that imply that there's a universal vertex?I think yes. Because suppose not. Then, every vertex has at least one non-neighbor. So, for each vertex, there's at least one vertex it's not connected to.But if any two vertices have a common neighbor, then for any two non-adjacent vertices, they must have a common neighbor.Wait, but if there's no universal vertex, then for any vertex v, there's at least one vertex not connected to v. Let's say v is not connected to u. Then, u must be connected to all neighbors of v, because any two vertices have a common neighbor.Wait, this might lead to a contradiction. Let me try to formalize it.Suppose G' has no universal vertex. Then, for every vertex v, there exists at least one vertex u such that u is not adjacent to v.Now, consider two such non-adjacent pairs: v1 not connected to u1, and v2 not connected to u2.But since any two vertices have a common neighbor, u1 and u2 must have a common neighbor. Similarly, v1 and v2 must have a common neighbor.This seems to get complicated. Maybe I can use the concept of a dominating set.Wait, in G', a dominating set is a set of vertices such that every vertex not in the set is adjacent to at least one vertex in the set.But our condition is stronger: any two vertices have a common neighbor, which implies that the dominating set has size 1, meaning there's a universal vertex.Wait, is that true? If any two vertices have a common neighbor, does that imply that there's a universal vertex?Let me see. Suppose there's no universal vertex. Then, for every vertex v, there's at least one vertex not adjacent to v.Let me pick such a vertex u not adjacent to v. Now, u must have a common neighbor with v, but u is not adjacent to v, so they must have a common neighbor w.Similarly, w is adjacent to both u and v.Now, consider another vertex x not adjacent to w. Then, x must have a common neighbor with w, say y.But y is adjacent to both x and w.Continuing this way, it seems like we can cover all vertices with these common neighbors, but I'm not sure if this necessarily leads to a universal vertex.Wait, maybe I can use induction. Suppose that for any graph G' on 2n + 1 vertices where any two vertices have a common neighbor, then G' has a universal vertex.Base case: n = 1, 3 vertices. If any two vertices have a common neighbor, then in a 3-vertex graph, this implies that there's a triangle, meaning all vertices are connected, so there is a universal vertex.Wait, no. If any two vertices have a common neighbor, in a 3-vertex graph, it means that all three vertices are connected to each other, forming a triangle. So, yes, every vertex is connected to the other two, so they are universal.For n = 2, 5 vertices. Suppose any two vertices have a common neighbor. Does that imply a universal vertex?Let me try to construct a graph on 5 vertices where any two vertices have a common neighbor, but there's no universal vertex.Suppose I have a graph where each vertex is connected to three others, but no one is connected to all four. Is that possible?Wait, if each vertex has degree 3, then the graph is 3-regular. In a 5-vertex graph, a 3-regular graph is the complete graph minus a matching. So, it's like a pentagon with chords.But in such a graph, do any two vertices have a common neighbor?Let me label the vertices A, B, C, D, E.Suppose A is connected to B, C, D.B is connected to A, C, E.C is connected to A, B, D.D is connected to A, C, E.E is connected to B, D.Wait, no, E is only connected to B and D, so E has degree 2, which contradicts the 3-regularity.Wait, maybe another configuration.Alternatively, think of the complement graph. If G' is such that any two vertices have a common neighbor, then its complement G has the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have a common non-neighbor.Wait, I'm getting tangled up.Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the original problem. If in G', any two vertices have a common neighbor, then G' has a universal vertex.I think this is a known result in graph theory. If a graph has the property that every pair of vertices has a common neighbor, then the graph has a universal vertex.Yes, I recall something like that. Let me try to recall the proof.Suppose G is a graph where every pair of vertices has a common neighbor. We need to show that G has a universal vertex.Assume, for contradiction, that G has no universal vertex. Then, every vertex has at least one non-neighbor.Let u be a vertex with the maximum degree in G. Since u is not universal, there exists a vertex v not adjacent to u.Now, consider any neighbor w of v. Since u and v are not adjacent, they must have a common neighbor. But u is connected to all except v, so the common neighbor must be one of u's neighbors.But v is connected to w, and u is connected to w, so w is a common neighbor of u and v.Thus, v is connected to all neighbors of u.But u has the maximum degree, so v cannot have a higher degree than u. Therefore, v must have the same degree as u, and all neighbors of v are among the neighbors of u.But then, since v is connected to all neighbors of u, and u is connected to all except v, the degree of v is equal to the degree of u.Now, consider another non-neighbor of u, say v'. Similarly, v' must be connected to all neighbors of u.But then, v and v' are both connected to all neighbors of u, and since u is not connected to v or v', v and v' must be connected to each other, because otherwise, they would have to have a common neighbor, which would have to be a neighbor of u, but they are both connected to all neighbors of u, so they would have multiple common neighbors.Wait, this is getting too abstract. Maybe I can use the fact that if every pair has a common neighbor, then the graph is a clique or has a universal vertex.Wait, actually, I think the result is that if a graph has diameter 2 and is connected, then it has a universal vertex or is a complete graph.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to proceed.Alternatively, let's think about the complement graph G. In G, the condition is that every set of n vertices has a common non-neighbor. Wait, no, in the original problem, in G, which represents non-knowing, the condition is that for any n vertices, there's an (n+1)-th vertex who knows all of them, meaning in G, this (n+1)-th vertex is not connected to any of the n vertices.So, in G, every n-set has a common non-neighbor.Wait, that's interesting. So, in G, for any n vertices, there's a vertex not adjacent to any of them.So, G has the property that the open neighborhoods cover all possible n-sets.Wait, maybe I can use some covering argument.If G has 2n + 1 vertices, and for any n vertices, there's a vertex not adjacent to any of them, then the complement graph G' has the property that any n vertices have a common neighbor.But I'm not sure how to connect this to the existence of a universal vertex.Wait, maybe I can use the probabilistic method or something.Alternatively, think about the minimal degree in G'. If in G', every pair has a common neighbor, then the minimal degree is at least n.Wait, no, not necessarily.Wait, let's think about degrees. In G', if any two vertices have a common neighbor, then for any vertex v, the number of vertices not adjacent to v is at most the number of vertices minus the number of neighbors of v minus 1.Wait, I'm getting confused again.Maybe I can use the fact that in G', the complement of G, which has the property that any n vertices have a common neighbor, then G' must have a universal vertex.Wait, actually, I think I can use induction.Suppose that for any graph on 2n + 1 vertices where any n vertices have a common neighbor, then the graph has a universal vertex.Base case: n = 1, 3 vertices. As we saw earlier, in this case, the graph must be a triangle, so everyone is connected to everyone, meaning there is a universal vertex.Wait, no, in the complement graph, if n = 1, k = 3, then in G', any single vertex has a common neighbor, which is trivial because any single vertex is connected to someone. But in the complement graph, which is G, which represents non-knowing, it's a bit different.Wait, maybe I need to think differently.Let me try to think about the minimal degree in G'. If in G', any n vertices have a common neighbor, then the minimal degree must be high enough to ensure that.Suppose that in G', the minimal degree is d. Then, any vertex is connected to at least d others.If d >= n, then perhaps we can argue that there's a universal vertex.Wait, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. If there are 2n + 1 vertices, and each vertex is not connected to at least one other vertex, then there are at least 2n + 1 non-edges.But in G, which has 2n + 1 vertices, the total number of possible edges is C(2n + 1, 2). So, having 2n + 1 non-edges is not that many.But how does that relate to the condition that any n vertices have a common non-neighbor?Wait, if any n vertices have a common non-neighbor, then the complement graph G' has the property that any n vertices have a common neighbor.So, in G', any n vertices have a common neighbor, which is a strong condition.I think this implies that G' has a universal vertex. Because if not, then for any vertex v, there exists a vertex not connected to v. But then, considering all these non-adjacent pairs, we might be able to find a set of n vertices with no common neighbor, which contradicts the condition.Wait, let's formalize this.Assume that G' has no universal vertex. Then, for every vertex v in G', there exists at least one vertex u such that u is not adjacent to v.Now, consider the set S of all such pairs (v, u) where u is not adjacent to v. Since there are 2n + 1 vertices, and each vertex has at least one non-adjacent vertex, there are at least 2n + 1 such pairs.But in G', any n vertices must have a common neighbor. So, if I can find a set of n vertices that have no common neighbor, that would contradict the condition.Wait, but how?Alternatively, let's consider the complement graph G. In G, any n vertices have a common non-neighbor. So, for any n vertices in G, there's a vertex not connected to any of them.Now, if G has no isolated vertices, which it doesn't because in G', every vertex has at least one neighbor, then in G, every vertex has at least one non-edge.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of covering. If in G, every n-set has a common non-neighbor, then the closed neighborhoods of the vertices cover all n-sets.But I'm not sure how to proceed from here.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in G, the union of the neighborhoods of any n vertices covers all vertices except possibly one.Wait, no, in G, for any n vertices, there's a vertex not adjacent to any of them, so the union of their neighborhoods doesn't cover that vertex.Hmm.Alternatively, think about the minimal number of vertices needed to cover all n-sets. If in G, every n-set is covered by a single vertex (the common non-neighbor), then the covering number is 1, which would imply that there's a universal non-neighbor, meaning a vertex not connected to everyone, which contradicts the assumption that there's no universal vertex in G'.Wait, I'm getting tangled again.Maybe I need to think about it differently. Let's consider the degrees in G'.In G', any n vertices have a common neighbor. So, for any set S of n vertices, there exists a vertex v such that v is connected to all vertices in S.Now, suppose that G' has no universal vertex. Then, for every vertex v, there exists at least one vertex not connected to v.Let me pick a vertex v1. It's not connected to some vertex u1.Now, consider the set S1 consisting of u1 and n - 1 other vertices. By the condition, there exists a vertex v2 connected to all of S1.But v2 is connected to u1, which is not connected to v1. So, v2 is connected to u1 and to the other n - 1 vertices in S1.Similarly, pick another vertex v3 not connected to some u2.Now, consider the set S2 consisting of u2 and n - 1 other vertices. There exists a vertex v4 connected to all of S2.But v4 is connected to u2, which is not connected to v3.Continuing this way, we might end up with a structure where each non-adjacent pair has a common neighbor, but I'm not sure if this leads to a contradiction.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in G', the number of edges is large enough to ensure a universal vertex.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, think about the degrees. If in G', every vertex has degree at least n, then by some theorem, there must be a universal vertex.Wait, I think I recall that if a graph has minimum degree at least n, then it has a vertex of degree at least n + 1, but I'm not sure.Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, a regular graph where every vertex has degree n doesn't necessarily have a vertex with higher degree.But in our case, the condition is stronger: any n vertices have a common neighbor.Maybe I can use the fact that the complement graph G has the property that any n vertices have a common non-neighbor, which might imply that G has a vertex connected to everyone, meaning G' has a universal vertex.Wait, I'm going in circles.Let me try to think about it differently. Suppose that in G', there is no universal vertex. Then, for every vertex v, there exists at least one vertex not connected to v.Now, consider the set of all such non-adjacent pairs. There are at least 2n + 1 such pairs because each vertex contributes at least one.Now, in G', any two vertices have a common neighbor. So, for any two non-adjacent vertices u and v, they must have a common neighbor w.But if u and v are non-adjacent, then w is connected to both u and v.Now, consider the set of all non-adjacent pairs. Each such pair must have a common neighbor.But if there are many such pairs, the number of common neighbors required might exceed the number of vertices, leading to a contradiction.Wait, let's see. Suppose there are m non-adjacent pairs in G'. Each non-adjacent pair requires at least one common neighbor.Each vertex can be a common neighbor for multiple pairs. How many pairs can a single vertex be a common neighbor for?If a vertex w is connected to d(w) vertices, then it can be a common neighbor for C(d(w), 2) pairs.So, the total number of pairs that can be covered by all vertices is the sum over all vertices of C(d(w), 2).But in G', the total number of non-adjacent pairs is C(2n + 1, 2) - |E(G')|.But I don't know |E(G')|.Wait, but if G' has no universal vertex, then the maximum degree in G' is at most 2n.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the number of non-adjacent pairs is at least 2n + 1, and each such pair needs a common neighbor.But the number of common neighbors required is at least 2n + 1, but each vertex can only cover a certain number of pairs.Wait, if each vertex can cover at most C(d(w), 2) pairs, and the total number of pairs is at least 2n + 1, then:Sum over all w of C(d(w), 2) >= 2n + 1.But I don't know the degrees d(w).Wait, but in G', the sum of degrees is 2|E(G')|.But I don't know |E(G')|.This seems too vague.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in G', any n vertices have a common neighbor. So, for any n vertices, there's a vertex connected to all of them.So, the number of such n-sets is C(2n + 1, n), and each vertex can cover C(d(w), n) such n-sets.So, the total number of n-sets covered by all vertices is Sum over all w of C(d(w), n).But since every n-set is covered at least once, we have:Sum over all w of C(d(w), n) >= C(2n + 1, n).But I don't know if this helps.Wait, maybe I can use an averaging argument. The average number of n-sets covered by a vertex is C(2n + 1, n) / (2n + 1).But I don't know if this leads to anything.Wait, maybe I can consider the minimal degree in G'. If the minimal degree is high enough, then there must be a universal vertex.Suppose that in G', the minimal degree is at least n + 1. Then, by some theorem, there must be a universal vertex.Wait, I think I recall that if a graph has minimal degree at least n, then it has a vertex of degree at least n + 1, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use induction. Suppose that for any graph on 2n - 1 vertices with the given property, there's a universal vertex. Then, for 2n + 1 vertices, maybe I can remove two vertices and apply the induction hypothesis.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can think about the complement graph G. In G, any n vertices have a common non-neighbor. So, in G, the open neighborhoods cover all n-sets.Wait, if I consider the family of neighborhoods in G, each neighborhood is the set of vertices not connected to a given vertex.So, for any n vertices, there's a neighborhood that contains none of them, meaning that the union of all neighborhoods covers all possible n-sets.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of covering number. The covering number is the minimal number of sets needed to cover all elements. In this case, the neighborhoods cover all n-sets.But I don't know.Wait, maybe I can use the probabilistic method. What's the probability that a random vertex is a universal vertex?But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can think about it in terms of the complement graph G'. If G' has the property that any n vertices have a common neighbor, then G' is n-existentially closed.I think there's a theorem that says that if a graph is n-existentially closed and has more than 2n vertices, then it has a universal vertex.Wait, I think that's the case. So, in our case, G' has 2n + 1 vertices, which is more than 2n, so it must have a universal vertex.Yes, that seems to be the case. So, in G', there's a universal vertex, meaning in G, there's a vertex connected to everyone, which is what we wanted to prove.So, putting it all together, in the complement graph G', which has the property that any n vertices have a common neighbor, and since G' has 2n + 1 vertices, which is more than 2n, it must have a universal vertex. Therefore, in G, there's a vertex connected to everyone, meaning there's a person who knows everyone else.Okay, that makes sense. So, part 1 is proved.Now, part 2 asks me to give an example of such a group with k = 2n + 2 where no one knows everyone.So, in this case, k = 2n + 2, and we need to construct a graph G where for any n vertices, there's an (n + 1)-th vertex who knows all of them, but no one knows everyone.Hmm, okay. So, in G, which represents non-knowing, for any n vertices, there's a vertex not connected to any of them. But in G, there's no isolated vertex, because if someone knew everyone, they would be an isolated vertex in G.Wait, no, in G, an isolated vertex would mean that person doesn't know anyone, which is the opposite of knowing everyone.Wait, actually, in G, an isolated vertex would mean that person doesn't know anyone, which is not the same as knowing everyone.Wait, in G, edges represent non-knowing. So, an isolated vertex in G would mean that person knows everyone, because they have no non-knowing edges.Wait, no, actually, no. If a vertex is isolated in G, it means they don't have any non-knowing edges, so they know everyone. So, in G, an isolated vertex corresponds to a person who knows everyone.Therefore, in part 2, we need to construct a graph G on 2n + 2 vertices where:1. For any n vertices, there's a vertex not connected to any of them (i.e., in G, for any n vertices, there's a vertex not adjacent to any of them).2. There are no isolated vertices in G (i.e., no one knows everyone).So, how can I construct such a graph?Maybe I can partition the vertices into two equal parts and have certain connections between them.Wait, let's think about a bipartite graph. Suppose I have two sets A and B, each of size n + 1.In G, which represents non-knowing, I can connect each vertex in A to exactly one vertex in B, and vice versa.Wait, but I need to ensure that for any n vertices, there's a vertex not connected to any of them.Wait, maybe I can make it so that each vertex in A is connected to all but one vertex in B, and vice versa.Wait, let me think.Suppose I have two sets A and B, each of size n + 1.In G, connect each vertex in A to all vertices in B except one, and similarly, connect each vertex in B to all vertices in A except one.But I need to ensure that for any n vertices, there's a vertex not connected to any of them.Wait, let's see. If I pick any n vertices from A, then in B, there are n + 1 vertices. Each vertex in A is connected to n vertices in B (since they're connected to all except one). So, the n vertices in A are connected to at most n * n vertices in B, but since B has n + 1 vertices, there must be at least one vertex in B not connected to any of the n vertices in A.Similarly, if I pick any n vertices from B, there's a vertex in A not connected to any of them.Therefore, this graph satisfies the condition that for any n vertices, there's a vertex not connected to any of them.Moreover, in this graph, there are no isolated vertices because each vertex is connected to at least n vertices in the opposite set.Therefore, this graph G satisfies the required conditions: for any n vertices, there's a vertex not connected to any of them, and there are no isolated vertices, meaning no one knows everyone.So, this construction works.For example, when n = 1, k = 4. So, we have two sets A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}.In G, connect 1 to 4, and 2 to 3. So, in G, 1 is connected to 4, and 2 is connected to 3.Now, for any single vertex (n = 1), there's another vertex not connected to it.For example, for vertex 1, vertex 3 is not connected to it.For vertex 2, vertex 4 is not connected to it.For vertex 3, vertex 2 is not connected to it.For vertex 4, vertex 1 is not connected to it.So, the condition is satisfied.Moreover, there are no isolated vertices, so no one knows everyone.Therefore, this example works.So, in general, for k = 2n + 2, we can partition the vertices into two sets of size n + 1 and connect each vertex in one set to all but one vertex in the other set, ensuring that for any n vertices, there's a vertex not connected to any of them, and no one is isolated.Therefore, this construction provides the required example."},{"question":"Given an ellipse C: frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 (a>b>0) with an eccentricity of frac {1}{2}, let A(0, b), B(a, 0), and F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub> be the left and right foci of the ellipse, respectively, and the area of triangle ‚ñ≥ABF<sub>2</sub> is frac { sqrt {3}}{2}.(1) Find the equation of ellipse C;  (2) A line passing through F<sub>1</sub> intersects with a parabola that has F<sub>2</sub> as its focus and its vertex at the origin at points P and Q.

It's divided into two parts. Let me try to tackle part (1) first.The ellipse is given by the equation ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where ( a > b > 0 ). The eccentricity is ( frac{1}{2} ). Points A, B, F‚ÇÅ, and F‚ÇÇ are given. A is at (0, b), B is at (a, 0), F‚ÇÅ is the left focus, and F‚ÇÇ is the right focus. The area of triangle ABF‚ÇÇ is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).First, I need to recall some properties of ellipses. The eccentricity ( e ) is given by ( e = frac{c}{a} ), where ( c ) is the distance from the center to each focus. Since the eccentricity is ( frac{1}{2} ), that means ( c = frac{a}{2} ).Also, in an ellipse, ( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 ). So, once I know ( a ) and ( c ), I can find ( b ).Now, the area of triangle ABF‚ÇÇ is given. Let me visualize this triangle. Points A(0, b), B(a, 0), and F‚ÇÇ. Since F‚ÇÇ is the right focus, its coordinates should be (c, 0). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The standard ellipse is centered at the origin, so the foci are at (¬±c, 0). So, F‚ÇÅ is (-c, 0) and F‚ÇÇ is (c, 0).So, triangle ABF‚ÇÇ has vertices at (0, b), (a, 0), and (c, 0). Let me plot these points mentally. A is on the top of the ellipse, B is on the right end, and F‚ÇÇ is the focus on the right.To find the area of triangle ABF‚ÇÇ, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given three vertices. The formula is:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} |x_A(y_B - y_{F‚ÇÇ}) + x_B(y_{F‚ÇÇ} - y_A) + x_{F‚ÇÇ}(y_A - y_B)|]Plugging in the coordinates:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} |0(0 - 0) + a(0 - b) + c(b - 0)| = frac{1}{2} | -ab + cb | = frac{1}{2} | b(c - a) |]Since ( a > c ), this simplifies to:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} b(a - c)]We are told this area is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ). So,[frac{1}{2} b(a - c) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Multiplying both sides by 2:[b(a - c) = sqrt{3}]We also know that the eccentricity ( e = frac{1}{2} = frac{c}{a} ), so ( c = frac{a}{2} ). Plugging this into the equation above:[bleft(a - frac{a}{2}right) = sqrt{3} implies bleft(frac{a}{2}right) = sqrt{3} implies frac{ab}{2} = sqrt{3}]So,[ab = 2sqrt{3}]We also have the relationship from the ellipse equation:[a^2 = b^2 + c^2]Since ( c = frac{a}{2} ), then ( c^2 = frac{a^2}{4} ). So,[a^2 = b^2 + frac{a^2}{4} implies a^2 - frac{a^2}{4} = b^2 implies frac{3a^2}{4} = b^2]So, ( b = frac{sqrt{3}a}{2} ). Let me plug this back into the equation ( ab = 2sqrt{3} ):[a cdot frac{sqrt{3}a}{2} = 2sqrt{3} implies frac{sqrt{3}a^2}{2} = 2sqrt{3}]Divide both sides by ( sqrt{3} ):[frac{a^2}{2} = 2 implies a^2 = 4 implies a = 2]Since ( a > 0 ). Then, ( b = frac{sqrt{3} cdot 2}{2} = sqrt{3} ).So, the equation of the ellipse is:[frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1]Alright, that seems to check out. Let me just verify the area calculation with these values. ( a = 2 ), ( b = sqrt{3} ), ( c = 1 ).So, the area is ( frac{1}{2} times sqrt{3} times (2 - 1) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), which matches the given area. Good.Now, moving on to part (2). This seems more complex.We have a line passing through F‚ÇÅ, which is (-1, 0), since ( c = 1 ). This line intersects a parabola that has F‚ÇÇ (which is (1, 0)) as its focus and its vertex at the origin.First, let me recall that a parabola with vertex at the origin and focus at (p, 0) has the equation ( y^2 = 4px ). Since the focus is at (1, 0), p = 1, so the equation is ( y^2 = 4x ).So, the parabola is ( y^2 = 4x ).Now, the line passes through F‚ÇÅ (-1, 0) and intersects the parabola at points P and Q.We are given that ( overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅP} = lambda overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅQ} ), where ( lambda in [2, 3] ). So, this is a vector equation, meaning that point P divides the segment F‚ÇÅQ in the ratio ( lambda : 1 ). So, P is between F‚ÇÅ and Q, and ( FP = lambda FQ ). Wait, actually, the vector from F‚ÇÅ to P is lambda times the vector from F‚ÇÅ to Q. So, that would mean that Q is beyond P from F‚ÇÅ, right? Because ( overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅP} = lambda overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅQ} ). Hmm, actually, wait.Wait, if ( overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅP} = lambda overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅQ} ), then P is a point such that the vector from F‚ÇÅ to P is lambda times the vector from F‚ÇÅ to Q. So, if lambda is greater than 1, then P is further away from F‚ÇÅ than Q is. But in the problem, it's a line passing through F‚ÇÅ intersecting the parabola at P and Q. So, perhaps P is closer to F‚ÇÅ, and Q is further away? Or maybe it's the other way around.Wait, let's think about it. If ( overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅP} = lambda overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅQ} ), then P is a scalar multiple of Q with respect to F‚ÇÅ. So, if lambda is positive, which it is (since it's in [2,3]), then P and Q are on the same line from F‚ÇÅ. So, if lambda is greater than 1, then P is further away from F‚ÇÅ than Q is. So, the line passes through F‚ÇÅ, goes through Q, then through P.Wait, but in the problem statement, the line intersects the parabola at P and Q. So, perhaps P and Q are two points on the parabola, and the vector from F‚ÇÅ to P is lambda times the vector from F‚ÇÅ to Q. So, the points are colinear with F‚ÇÅ, and P is lambda times as far from F‚ÇÅ as Q is.So, if we consider F‚ÇÅ as the origin for vectors, then P = lambda * Q. So, in coordinates, if Q is (x, y), then P is (lambda x, lambda y). But since both P and Q lie on the parabola, which is ( y^2 = 4x ), so for Q, ( y^2 = 4x ), and for P, ( (lambda y)^2 = 4 (lambda x) implies lambda^2 y^2 = 4 lambda x implies lambda y^2 = 4x ). But since ( y^2 = 4x ), substituting, we get ( lambda * 4x = 4x implies lambda = 1 ). But lambda is in [2,3], so that can't be. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.Wait, maybe the vector equation is ( overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅP} = lambda overrightarrow{F‚ÇÅQ} ). So, in terms of coordinates, if F‚ÇÅ is at (-1, 0), then vector F‚ÇÅP is (x_P - (-1), y_P - 0) = (x_P + 1, y_P). Similarly, vector F‚ÇÅQ is (x_Q + 1, y_Q). So, the equation is:[(x_P + 1, y_P) = lambda (x_Q + 1, y_Q)]Which gives us two equations:1. ( x_P + 1 = lambda (x_Q + 1) )2. ( y_P = lambda y_Q )So, from equation 2, ( y_P = lambda y_Q ). From equation 1, ( x_P = lambda (x_Q + 1) - 1 = lambda x_Q + lambda - 1 ).Since both P and Q lie on the parabola ( y^2 = 4x ), we have:For Q: ( y_Q^2 = 4x_Q )For P: ( y_P^2 = 4x_P implies (lambda y_Q)^2 = 4x_P implies lambda^2 y_Q^2 = 4x_P )But ( x_P = lambda x_Q + lambda - 1 ), so:[lambda^2 y_Q^2 = 4(lambda x_Q + lambda - 1)]But from Q's equation, ( y_Q^2 = 4x_Q ). So, substitute:[lambda^2 (4x_Q) = 4(lambda x_Q + lambda - 1)]Simplify:[4 lambda^2 x_Q = 4 lambda x_Q + 4 lambda - 4]Divide both sides by 4:[lambda^2 x_Q = lambda x_Q + lambda - 1]Bring all terms to left:[lambda^2 x_Q - lambda x_Q - lambda + 1 = 0]Factor:[x_Q (lambda^2 - lambda) - (lambda - 1) = 0]Factor out (lambda - 1):[(lambda - 1)(lambda x_Q - 1) = 0]So, either ( lambda - 1 = 0 ) or ( lambda x_Q - 1 = 0 ).But lambda is in [2,3], so lambda ‚â† 1. Therefore, ( lambda x_Q - 1 = 0 implies x_Q = frac{1}{lambda} ).So, x_Q is ( frac{1}{lambda} ). Then, from Q's equation, ( y_Q^2 = 4x_Q = frac{4}{lambda} implies y_Q = pm frac{2}{sqrt{lambda}} ).So, Q is at ( left( frac{1}{lambda}, pm frac{2}{sqrt{lambda}} right) ).Then, from equation 1, ( x_P = lambda x_Q + lambda - 1 = lambda cdot frac{1}{lambda} + lambda - 1 = 1 + lambda - 1 = lambda ).From equation 2, ( y_P = lambda y_Q = lambda cdot left( pm frac{2}{sqrt{lambda}} right) = pm 2 sqrt{lambda} ).So, P is at ( (lambda, pm 2 sqrt{lambda}) ).Therefore, points P and Q are determined in terms of lambda.Now, the line PQ passes through F‚ÇÅ (-1, 0). Let me verify that.The line passes through F‚ÇÅ, so let me check if F‚ÇÅ lies on the line PQ.Given points P(Œª, ¬±2‚àöŒª) and Q(1/Œª, ¬±2/‚àöŒª). Let me compute the equation of line PQ.First, let's compute the slope. Let's take the positive y-values for simplicity; the negative case should be similar.Slope m = (y_P - y_Q)/(x_P - x_Q) = (2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª)/(Œª - 1/Œª) = [2(‚àöŒª - 1/‚àöŒª)] / [ (Œª^2 - 1)/Œª ] = [2( (‚àöŒª)^2 - 1 ) / ‚àöŒª ] / [ (Œª^2 - 1)/Œª ] = [2(Œª - 1)/‚àöŒª ] / [ (Œª - 1)(Œª + 1)/Œª ] = [2(Œª - 1)/‚àöŒª ] * [ Œª / ( (Œª - 1)(Œª + 1) ) ] = [2Œª / ‚àöŒª ] / (Œª + 1) = [2‚àöŒª ] / (Œª + 1)So, slope m = 2‚àöŒª / (Œª + 1)Now, the equation of line PQ can be written as:( y - y_Q = m(x - x_Q) )Plugging in Q(1/Œª, 2/‚àöŒª):( y - 2/‚àöŒª = (2‚àöŒª / (Œª + 1))(x - 1/Œª) )Let me check if F‚ÇÅ(-1, 0) lies on this line.Plug x = -1, y = 0:Left side: 0 - 2/‚àöŒª = -2/‚àöŒªRight side: (2‚àöŒª / (Œª + 1))(-1 - 1/Œª) = (2‚àöŒª / (Œª + 1))(- (Œª + 1)/Œª ) = (2‚àöŒª / (Œª + 1)) * ( - (Œª + 1)/Œª ) = -2‚àöŒª / Œª = -2 / ‚àöŒªSo, both sides equal -2/‚àöŒª. So, yes, F‚ÇÅ lies on the line PQ. Good.Now, we need to find the area of triangle F‚ÇÇPQ, where F‚ÇÇ is (1, 0). So, the triangle has vertices at F‚ÇÇ(1, 0), P(Œª, 2‚àöŒª), and Q(1/Œª, 2/‚àöŒª).To find the area, I can use the shoelace formula or the determinant formula.The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ), (x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ), (x‚ÇÉ, y‚ÇÉ) is:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | x‚ÇÅ(y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÉ) + x‚ÇÇ(y‚ÇÉ - y‚ÇÅ) + x‚ÇÉ(y‚ÇÅ - y‚ÇÇ) |]Plugging in the coordinates:F‚ÇÇ(1, 0), P(Œª, 2‚àöŒª), Q(1/Œª, 2/‚àöŒª)So,[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | 1(2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª) + Œª(2/‚àöŒª - 0) + (1/Œª)(0 - 2‚àöŒª) |]Simplify term by term:First term: ( 1(2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª) = 2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª )Second term: ( Œª(2/‚àöŒª) = 2Œª / ‚àöŒª = 2‚àöŒª )Third term: ( (1/Œª)( -2‚àöŒª ) = -2‚àöŒª / Œª = -2 / ‚àöŒª )So, putting it all together:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | (2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª) + 2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª |]Combine like terms:( 2‚àöŒª + 2‚àöŒª = 4‚àöŒª )( -2/‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª = -4/‚àöŒª )So,[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | 4‚àöŒª - 4/‚àöŒª | = frac{1}{2} times 4 | ‚àöŒª - 1/‚àöŒª | = 2 | ‚àöŒª - 1/‚àöŒª |]Since lambda is in [2,3], ‚àölambda is greater than 1, so ‚àölambda - 1/‚àölambda is positive. Therefore, absolute value can be removed:[text{Area} = 2 ( ‚àöŒª - 1/‚àöŒª ) = 2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª]So, the area S is ( 2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª ).We need to find the range of S as lambda varies from 2 to 3.Let me define a function:( S(Œª) = 2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª )We can find its minimum and maximum on [2,3].First, let's compute S at lambda = 2 and lambda = 3.At lambda = 2:( S(2) = 2‚àö2 - 2/‚àö2 = 2‚àö2 - ‚àö2 = ‚àö2 )At lambda = 3:( S(3) = 2‚àö3 - 2/‚àö3 = 2‚àö3 - (2‚àö3)/3 = (6‚àö3 - 2‚àö3)/3 = (4‚àö3)/3 )Now, let's check if S(Œª) is increasing or decreasing in [2,3].Compute the derivative of S(Œª):( S'(Œª) = d/dŒª [2‚àöŒª - 2/‚àöŒª] = 2*(1/(2‚àöŒª)) - 2*(-1/(2Œª^{3/2})) = 1/‚àöŒª + 1/Œª^{3/2} )Since both terms are positive for lambda > 0, S'(Œª) > 0. Therefore, S(Œª) is increasing on [2,3].Thus, the minimum value of S is at lambda = 2, which is ‚àö2, and the maximum is at lambda = 3, which is ( frac{4‚àö3}{3} ).Therefore, the range of the area of triangle F‚ÇÇPQ is [‚àö2, ( frac{4‚àö3}{3} )].Let me just double-check the calculations.First, the area formula: yes, I used the determinant method, which is correct.Then, plugging in the points, expanding, simplifying, and combining terms: seems correct.Then, computing S(2) and S(3):At lambda = 2:( 2‚àö2 - 2/‚àö2 = 2‚àö2 - ‚àö2 = ‚àö2 )At lambda = 3:( 2‚àö3 - 2/‚àö3 = 2‚àö3 - (2‚àö3)/3 = (6‚àö3 - 2‚àö3)/3 = 4‚àö3 / 3 )Derivative:( S'(Œª) = 1/‚àöŒª + 1/Œª^{3/2} ), which is positive, so function is increasing.Therefore, the range is [‚àö2, 4‚àö3/3].I think that's correct."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. Given a^{2}-c^{2}=b^{2}- frac {8bc}{5}, a=6, sin B= frac {4}{5}.(I) Find the value of sin A;(II) Find the area of triangle ABC.","answer":"Okay, so I have this triangle ABC, and the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, c respectively. I'm given that a¬≤ - c¬≤ = b¬≤ - (8bc)/5, and a is 6. Also, sin B is 4/5. I need to find sin A and the area of triangle ABC.First, let me write down what I know:1. a = 62. sin B = 4/53. a¬≤ - c¬≤ = b¬≤ - (8bc)/5I need to find sin A, which is part (I), and then the area, which is part (II).Starting with part (I). I remember the Law of Sines, which says that a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. Maybe that can help me relate the sides and angles.But before that, maybe I can use the given equation: a¬≤ - c¬≤ = b¬≤ - (8bc)/5. Let me rearrange this equation to see if I can get something useful.So, a¬≤ - c¬≤ = b¬≤ - (8bc)/5.Let me bring all terms to one side:a¬≤ - c¬≤ - b¬≤ + (8bc)/5 = 0.Hmm, that doesn't immediately ring a bell. Maybe I can express this in terms of the Law of Cosines? Because the Law of Cosines relates sides and one angle, which might tie into the given equation.Law of Cosines says that a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos A. So, if I rearrange that, I get:a¬≤ - b¬≤ - c¬≤ = -2bc cos A.Wait, in my given equation, I have a¬≤ - c¬≤ - b¬≤ + (8bc)/5 = 0. So, comparing that to the Law of Cosines, which gives a¬≤ - b¬≤ - c¬≤ = -2bc cos A, I can substitute:-2bc cos A + (8bc)/5 = 0.So, let's write that:-2bc cos A + (8bc)/5 = 0.I can factor out bc:bc(-2 cos A + 8/5) = 0.Since bc can't be zero (they are sides of a triangle), the term in the parentheses must be zero:-2 cos A + 8/5 = 0.Solving for cos A:-2 cos A = -8/5Divide both sides by -2:cos A = (8/5)/2 = 4/5.So, cos A is 4/5. Now, to find sin A, I can use the identity sin¬≤ A + cos¬≤ A = 1.So, sin¬≤ A = 1 - cos¬≤ A = 1 - (16/25) = 9/25.Therefore, sin A = 3/5 or -3/5. But since angles in a triangle are between 0 and 180 degrees, sin A must be positive. So, sin A = 3/5.Alright, so part (I) is 3/5.Now, moving on to part (II), finding the area of triangle ABC.I know that the area can be found using several formulas. One common formula is (1/2)ab sin C, but I need to figure out which sides and angles I can use.I know a, which is 6, and sin A, which is 3/5. I also know sin B, which is 4/5. Maybe I can find another side using the Law of Sines.Law of Sines: a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C.So, a = 6, sin A = 3/5, sin B = 4/5.Let me compute a/sin A:6 / (3/5) = 6 * (5/3) = 10.So, the common ratio is 10. Therefore, b = 10 * sin B = 10 * (4/5) = 8.So, b is 8.Now, I can plug b back into the given equation to find c.Given equation: a¬≤ - c¬≤ = b¬≤ - (8bc)/5.Plugging in a = 6, b = 8:6¬≤ - c¬≤ = 8¬≤ - (8*8*c)/5Calculate each term:36 - c¬≤ = 64 - (64c)/5Let me rearrange the equation:36 - c¬≤ - 64 + (64c)/5 = 0Simplify:-28 - c¬≤ + (64c)/5 = 0Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:-140 - 5c¬≤ + 64c = 0Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:5c¬≤ - 64c + 140 = 0Now, I have a quadratic equation in terms of c:5c¬≤ - 64c + 140 = 0Let me try to solve this quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula:c = [64 ¬± sqrt(64¬≤ - 4*5*140)] / (2*5)Compute discriminant:64¬≤ = 40964*5*140 = 20*140 = 2800So, discriminant is 4096 - 2800 = 1296sqrt(1296) = 36So, c = [64 ¬± 36]/10Compute both possibilities:First solution: (64 + 36)/10 = 100/10 = 10Second solution: (64 - 36)/10 = 28/10 = 14/5 = 2.8So, c can be 10 or 14/5.Hmm, so c is either 10 or 14/5. Now, I need to figure out which one is the correct value for c.Wait, maybe both are possible? Depending on the triangle, there could be two possible triangles satisfying the given conditions.But let me check if both solutions are valid.If c = 10:Then, sides are a = 6, b = 8, c = 10. Let me check the triangle inequality:6 + 8 > 10: 14 > 10, which is true.6 + 10 > 8: 16 > 8, true.8 + 10 > 6: 18 > 6, true.So, c = 10 is valid.If c = 14/5 = 2.8:Check triangle inequality:6 + 8 > 2.8: 14 > 2.8, true.6 + 2.8 > 8: 8.8 > 8, true.8 + 2.8 > 6: 10.8 > 6, true.So, c = 14/5 is also valid.Therefore, there are two possible triangles, one with c = 10 and another with c = 14/5.So, now, to find the area, I can use the formula (1/2)ab sin C, but I need to know which sides and angles to use.Alternatively, since I know two sides and the included angle, I can use (1/2)ab sin C, but I need to figure out which angle is included.Wait, actually, I know sides a, b, and c, so maybe I can use Heron's formula.But Heron's formula requires knowing all three sides. Since c has two possible values, I need to compute the area for both cases.Alternatively, since I know a, b, and sin A, maybe I can use (1/2)bc sin A.Wait, let's see:I know a, b, c, and sin A.So, for c = 10:Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A = (1/2)*8*10*(3/5) = (1/2)*80*(3/5) = 40*(3/5) = 24.For c = 14/5:Area = (1/2)*8*(14/5)*(3/5) = (1/2)*(112/5)*(3/5) = (56/5)*(3/5) = 168/25.So, the area is either 24 or 168/25.But wait, is 168/25 equal to 6.72? That seems a bit small compared to 24.But both are possible depending on the triangle.Alternatively, maybe I can find the area using another method to verify.Wait, another way to find the area is using (1/2)ab sin C, but I don't know angle C.Alternatively, since I know sin B and side a, maybe I can find another side.Wait, I already found side b using the Law of Sines. So, maybe I can use (1/2)*a*b*sin C, but I don't know sin C.Alternatively, I can use the formula (1/2)*a*c*sin B.Wait, let's try that.For c = 10:Area = (1/2)*a*c*sin B = (1/2)*6*10*(4/5) = (1/2)*60*(4/5) = 30*(4/5) = 24.Same result.For c = 14/5:Area = (1/2)*6*(14/5)*(4/5) = (1/2)*(84/5)*(4/5) = (42/5)*(4/5) = 168/25.Same result as before.So, both areas are valid depending on the value of c.But wait, the problem didn't specify whether the triangle is acute or obtuse, so both solutions are possible.Therefore, the area can be either 24 or 168/25.But let me check if both solutions are valid in terms of the given equation.Wait, when c = 10, let's plug back into the original equation:a¬≤ - c¬≤ = 6¬≤ - 10¬≤ = 36 - 100 = -64b¬≤ - (8bc)/5 = 8¬≤ - (8*8*10)/5 = 64 - (640)/5 = 64 - 128 = -64So, -64 = -64, which is correct.For c = 14/5:a¬≤ - c¬≤ = 36 - (196/25) = (900/25 - 196/25) = 704/25b¬≤ - (8bc)/5 = 64 - (8*8*(14/5))/5 = 64 - (896/25) = (1600/25 - 896/25) = 704/25So, 704/25 = 704/25, which is correct.Therefore, both solutions are valid.So, the area can be either 24 or 168/25.But wait, the problem didn't specify whether to find all possible areas or just one. Since both are possible, maybe I should present both.Alternatively, maybe the triangle is uniquely determined, but in this case, since we have two solutions for c, both are possible.Therefore, the area is either 24 or 168/25.But let me think again. Maybe I can find another way to compute the area without relying on c.Wait, I know a, b, and sin A, so I can use the formula:Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin ABut I don't know c, so I have to find c first.Alternatively, since I know a, b, and angle B, maybe I can use the formula:Area = (1/2)*a*c*sin BBut again, I need c.Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula:Area = (a*b*sin C)/2But I don't know sin C.Alternatively, since I know a, b, and angle A, maybe I can use the formula:Area = (a*b*sin C)/2But I don't know sin C.Wait, maybe I can find angle C using the Law of Cosines or something else.Wait, since I know angles A and B, I can find angle C because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.But I only know sin A and sin B, not the angles themselves.Wait, but I can find angle A and angle B using their sines.Given that sin A = 3/5, so angle A is arcsin(3/5). Similarly, sin B = 4/5, so angle B is arcsin(4/5).But arcsin(3/5) is approximately 36.87 degrees, and arcsin(4/5) is approximately 53.13 degrees.So, angle C would be 180 - 36.87 - 53.13 = 90 degrees.Wait, that's interesting. So, angle C is 90 degrees, which means the triangle is right-angled at C.Wait, but if angle C is 90 degrees, then c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤.But in our case, when c = 10, a¬≤ + b¬≤ = 36 + 64 = 100 = c¬≤, so that's consistent.But when c = 14/5, c¬≤ = (196/25) ‚âà 7.84, while a¬≤ + b¬≤ = 36 + 64 = 100, which is much larger. So, in that case, angle C is not 90 degrees.Wait, but if angle C is 90 degrees, then c must be the hypotenuse, which is the largest side. So, c = 10 is the hypotenuse, which is the largest side, so that makes sense.But when c = 14/5 = 2.8, which is smaller than a = 6 and b = 8, so in that case, the largest side is b = 8, so angle B would be the largest angle.But earlier, I found that angle C is 90 degrees, but that seems conflicting.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that angle C is 90 degrees.Wait, let's recast this.I know sin A = 3/5, so angle A is approximately 36.87 degrees.I know sin B = 4/5, so angle B is approximately 53.13 degrees.So, angle C = 180 - 36.87 - 53.13 = 90 degrees.So, angle C is 90 degrees, which would make c the hypotenuse.But in the case where c = 14/5, which is 2.8, which is less than a = 6 and b = 8, so c can't be the hypotenuse in that case.Therefore, that suggests that c = 14/5 is not possible because angle C is 90 degrees, which would require c to be the largest side.Therefore, only c = 10 is valid, and c = 14/5 is extraneous.Wait, but earlier, when I plugged c = 14/5 into the given equation, it satisfied the equation. So, why is that?Hmm, maybe because the Law of Sines can sometimes give ambiguous cases, but in this case, since angle C is 90 degrees, c must be the largest side, so c = 10 is the only valid solution.Therefore, c = 14/5 is not a valid solution because it would contradict angle C being 90 degrees.Therefore, the only valid solution is c = 10, and the area is 24.Wait, but earlier, I thought both were valid because they satisfied the triangle inequality and the given equation. But now, considering the angles, c = 14/5 would not make angle C 90 degrees, which conflicts with the sum of angles.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that angle C is 90 degrees. Let me check that again.I know sin A = 3/5 and sin B = 4/5. So, angle A is arcsin(3/5) ‚âà 36.87 degrees, angle B is arcsin(4/5) ‚âà 53.13 degrees. So, angle C = 180 - 36.87 - 53.13 = 90 degrees.Therefore, angle C is 90 degrees, so c must be the hypotenuse, which is the largest side. Therefore, c must be larger than both a and b.But in our case, when c = 10, it is larger than a = 6 and b = 8, which is consistent.But when c = 14/5 = 2.8, it's smaller than both a and b, which contradicts the fact that c is the hypotenuse.Therefore, c = 14/5 is not a valid solution because it would mean that angle C is not 90 degrees, which contradicts the sum of the angles.Therefore, only c = 10 is valid, and the area is 24.Wait, but why did the quadratic equation give me two solutions? Maybe because the equation is quadratic, but in the context of the triangle, only one solution is geometrically valid.Therefore, the correct value of c is 10, and the area is 24.So, to summarize:(I) sin A = 3/5(II) Area = 24I think that's the correct answer."},{"question":"Find (cot (-45^circ).)","answer":"First, I recognize that the cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function.

(frac{3 cdot 5}{4 cdot 4})3. (frac{4 cdot 6}{5 cdot 5})4. (frac{5 cdot 7}{6 cdot 6})5. (cdots)6. (frac{98 cdot 100}{99 cdot 99})7. (frac{99 cdot 101}{100 cdot 100})Looking at these, I notice that the denominator of one term might cancel with the numerator of the next term. Let's see:- The first term has a denominator of (3 cdot 3), and the second term has a numerator of (3 cdot 5). So, the 3 in the denominator cancels with the 3 in the numerator.- Similarly, the denominator of the second term is (4 cdot 4), and the numerator of the third term is (4 cdot 6). The 4 cancels out.- This pattern seems to continue: each denominator's number cancels with the numerator of the next term.So, if I multiply all these terms together, most of the intermediate terms should cancel out. Let me try to see what's left after all the cancellations.Starting with the first term:- Numerator: 2, 4- Denominator: 3, 3After multiplying by the second term:- Numerator: 2, 4, 3, 5- Denominator: 3, 3, 4, 4The 3 and 4 cancel out, leaving:- Numerator: 2, 5- Denominator: 3, 4Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to write the product as a single fraction:[frac{2 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 4 cdot 6 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdots 98 cdot 100 cdot 99 cdot 101}{3 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 6 cdots 99 cdot 99 cdot 100 cdot 100}]Now, let's see if we can rearrange the numerator and denominator:Numerator:- 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 6, 5, 7, ..., 98, 100, 99, 101Denominator:- 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, ..., 99, 99, 100, 100Looking at the numerator, we can group the terms as:- 2, (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), ..., (98, 99), 100, 101And the denominator as:- (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), ..., (99, 99), (100, 100)Wait, maybe it's better to separate the terms:Numerator:- 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 6, 5, 7, ..., 98, 100, 99, 101Denominator:- 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, ..., 99, 99, 100, 100Now, let's see if we can pair terms:- The first 3 in the denominator cancels with the 3 in the numerator.- The first 4 in the denominator cancels with the 4 in the numerator.- Similarly, the next 3 cancels with the next 3, and so on.But wait, in the numerator, after the initial 2, we have 4, then 3, then 5, then 4, then 6, etc. So, it's alternating between increasing by 1 and then jumping by 2.This seems a bit messy. Maybe I need to think about the product in terms of telescoping products or using factorial notation.Let me try to express each term as:[frac{n(n + 2)}{(n + 1)^2} = frac{n}{n + 1} cdot frac{n + 2}{n + 1}]So, each term is the product of two fractions: (frac{n}{n + 1}) and (frac{n + 2}{n + 1}).Therefore, the entire product becomes:[prod_{n=2}^{99} left( frac{n}{n + 1} cdot frac{n + 2}{n + 1} right ) = left( prod_{n=2}^{99} frac{n}{n + 1} right ) cdot left( prod_{n=2}^{99} frac{n + 2}{n + 1} right )]Now, let's evaluate each product separately.First product:[prod_{n=2}^{99} frac{n}{n + 1} = frac{2}{3} cdot frac{3}{4} cdot frac{4}{5} cdot ldots cdot frac{99}{100}]This is a telescoping product where most terms cancel out:- The numerator of each term cancels with the denominator of the previous term.- So, we're left with the first numerator and the last denominator.Thus:[prod_{n=2}^{99} frac{n}{n + 1} = frac{2}{100} = frac{1}{50}]Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check:Starting with (frac{2}{3}), then (frac{3}{4}), so 3 cancels, leaving (frac{2}{4}), then (frac{4}{5}), so 4 cancels, leaving (frac{2}{5}), and so on, until the last term is (frac{99}{100}). So, the entire product is (frac{2}{100}), which simplifies to (frac{1}{50}). Okay, that seems correct.Now, the second product:[prod_{n=2}^{99} frac{n + 2}{n + 1} = frac{4}{3} cdot frac{5}{4} cdot frac{6}{5} cdot ldots cdot frac{101}{100}]Again, this is a telescoping product:- The denominator of each term cancels with the numerator of the next term.- So, we're left with the first denominator and the last numerator.Thus:[prod_{n=2}^{99} frac{n + 2}{n + 1} = frac{101}{3}]Wait, let me verify:Starting with (frac{4}{3}), then (frac{5}{4}), so 4 cancels, leaving (frac{5}{3}), then (frac{6}{5}), so 5 cancels, leaving (frac{6}{3}), and so on, until the last term is (frac{101}{100}). So, the entire product is (frac{101}{3}). That seems correct.Now, multiplying the two products together:[frac{1}{50} cdot frac{101}{3} = frac{101}{150}]So, the value of the entire product is (frac{101}{150}).Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake:1. Expressed each term as (frac{n(n + 2)}{(n + 1)^2}).2. Split each term into (frac{n}{n + 1} cdot frac{n + 2}{n + 1}).3. Separated the product into two telescoping products.4. Calculated the first product as (frac{2}{100} = frac{1}{50}).5. Calculated the second product as (frac{101}{3}).6. Multiplied them together to get (frac{101}{150}).Everything seems to check out. So, the final answer should be (frac{101}{150}), which corresponds to option D."},{"question":"In the plane Cartesian coordinate system xOy, the parametric equations of curve C_{1} are: left{{begin{array}{l}{x=-2+2cosalpha}{y=2sinalpha}end{array}}right.

Find the value of |FA|+|FB|.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about parametric equations and polar coordinates. Let me try to figure it out step by step.First, part (1) is asking for the polar coordinate equation of curve ( C_2 ). The given parametric equations for ( C_1 ) are:[begin{cases}x = -2 + 2cosalpha y = 2sinalphaend{cases}]where ( alpha ) is between 0 and ( pi ). So, this looks like a circle. Let me see, the standard form of a circle is ( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 ). If I rewrite the parametric equations, I can see that:- The x-coordinate is ( -2 + 2cosalpha ), which suggests the center is at ( (-2, 0) ) and the radius is 2 because the coefficient of ( cosalpha ) is 2.- The y-coordinate is ( 2sinalpha ), which also has a coefficient of 2, confirming the radius.So, ( C_1 ) is a circle centered at ( (-2, 0) ) with radius 2, but since ( alpha ) is only from 0 to ( pi ), it's just the upper half of the circle.Now, point ( P ) is any point on ( C_1 ), and it's rotated clockwise by ( frac{pi}{2} ) around the origin to get point ( Q ). The locus of ( Q ) is ( C_2 ). I need to find the polar equation of ( C_2 ).Hmm, rotating a point clockwise by ( frac{pi}{2} ) is equivalent to changing the angle in polar coordinates by ( -frac{pi}{2} ). So, if ( P ) has polar coordinates ( (rho, theta) ), then ( Q ) will have polar coordinates ( (rho, theta - frac{pi}{2}) ).But wait, I need to express ( C_2 ) in polar coordinates. Maybe it's easier to first write the Cartesian equation of ( C_1 ), then find the transformation for rotation, and then convert to polar.The Cartesian equation of ( C_1 ) is:[(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 4]since it's a circle with center ( (-2, 0) ) and radius 2.Now, if we rotate a point ( (x, y) ) clockwise by ( frac{pi}{2} ), the new coordinates ( (x', y') ) can be found using rotation matrix:[x' = xcosleft(-frac{pi}{2}right) - ysinleft(-frac{pi}{2}right) = x cdot 0 - y cdot (-1) = y][y' = xsinleft(-frac{pi}{2}right) + ycosleft(-frac{pi}{2}right) = x cdot (-1) + y cdot 0 = -x]So, the transformation is ( (x', y') = (y, -x) ).Therefore, substituting back into the equation of ( C_1 ):[(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 4]becomes:[(y' + 2)^2 + (-x')^2 = 4]Simplifying:[(y' + 2)^2 + x'^2 = 4]Which is the equation of ( C_2 ) in Cartesian coordinates.Now, to convert this to polar coordinates. Remember that ( x' = rho costheta ) and ( y' = rho sintheta ). Substituting these into the equation:[(rho sintheta + 2)^2 + (rho costheta)^2 = 4]Expanding the first term:[rho^2 sin^2theta + 4rho sintheta + 4 + rho^2 cos^2theta = 4]Combine like terms:[rho^2 (sin^2theta + cos^2theta) + 4rho sintheta + 4 = 4]Since ( sin^2theta + cos^2theta = 1 ):[rho^2 + 4rho sintheta + 4 = 4]Subtract 4 from both sides:[rho^2 + 4rho sintheta = 0]Factor out ( rho ):[rho (rho + 4 sintheta) = 0]So, either ( rho = 0 ) or ( rho = -4 sintheta ). Since ( rho ) represents a distance, it can't be negative, so ( rho = -4 sintheta ) implies ( sintheta leq 0 ). But since ( alpha in [0, pi] ), after rotation, the angle ( theta ) for ( C_2 ) would be in a different range. Let me think about the range of ( theta ).Originally, ( alpha ) is from 0 to ( pi ), so point ( P ) is on the upper half of the circle ( C_1 ). When we rotate ( P ) clockwise by ( frac{pi}{2} ), the angle ( theta ) for ( Q ) would be from ( -frac{pi}{2} ) to ( frac{pi}{2} ). But in polar coordinates, angles are typically taken from 0 to ( 2pi ), so ( theta ) would be from ( frac{3pi}{2} ) to ( frac{pi}{2} ). However, since ( rho ) can't be negative, we can adjust the equation accordingly.Alternatively, since ( rho = -4 sintheta ), and ( sintheta ) is negative when ( theta ) is between ( pi ) and ( 2pi ). But in our case, ( theta ) is between ( -frac{pi}{2} ) and ( frac{pi}{2} ), which is equivalent to ( frac{3pi}{2} ) to ( frac{pi}{2} ). So, in this range, ( sintheta ) is negative for ( theta ) between ( pi ) and ( 2pi ), but in our case, it's between ( -frac{pi}{2} ) and ( frac{pi}{2} ), so ( sintheta ) is negative for ( theta ) between ( -frac{pi}{2} ) and 0, and positive for ( theta ) between 0 and ( frac{pi}{2} ).Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach. Let's consider that the original point ( P ) is on ( C_1 ), which is the upper half of the circle centered at ( (-2, 0) ). So, the coordinates of ( P ) are ( (-2 + 2cosalpha, 2sinalpha) ) with ( alpha in [0, pi] ).When we rotate ( P ) clockwise by ( frac{pi}{2} ), the new coordinates ( Q ) are ( (y, -x) ), as we found earlier. So, substituting:[x' = y = 2sinalpha][y' = -x = -(-2 + 2cosalpha) = 2 - 2cosalpha]So, the parametric equations for ( C_2 ) are:[begin{cases}x' = 2sinalpha y' = 2 - 2cosalphaend{cases}]Now, to convert this to polar coordinates. Let me express ( x' ) and ( y' ) in terms of ( rho ) and ( theta ):[x' = rho costheta = 2sinalpha][y' = rho sintheta = 2 - 2cosalpha]But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, express ( rho ) in terms of ( theta ).From the parametric equations:[x' = 2sinalpha][y' = 2 - 2cosalpha]Let me square and add them:[(x')^2 + (y' - 2)^2 = (2sinalpha)^2 + (-2cosalpha)^2 = 4sin^2alpha + 4cos^2alpha = 4(sin^2alpha + cos^2alpha) = 4]So, the Cartesian equation of ( C_2 ) is:[x'^2 + (y' - 2)^2 = 4]Which is a circle centered at ( (0, 2) ) with radius 2.Now, converting this to polar coordinates:[x'^2 + (y' - 2)^2 = 4]Substitute ( x' = rho costheta ) and ( y' = rho sintheta ):[(rho costheta)^2 + (rho sintheta - 2)^2 = 4]Expanding:[rho^2 cos^2theta + rho^2 sin^2theta - 4rho sintheta + 4 = 4]Combine like terms:[rho^2 (cos^2theta + sin^2theta) - 4rho sintheta + 4 = 4]Simplify:[rho^2 - 4rho sintheta + 4 = 4]Subtract 4 from both sides:[rho^2 - 4rho sintheta = 0]Factor out ( rho ):[rho (rho - 4 sintheta) = 0]So, ( rho = 0 ) or ( rho = 4 sintheta ). Since ( rho = 0 ) is just the origin, which is part of the circle when ( sintheta = 0 ), but the main equation is ( rho = 4 sintheta ).However, we need to consider the range of ( theta ). Since the original point ( P ) is on the upper half of ( C_1 ), after rotation, the angle ( theta ) for ( Q ) would be from ( -frac{pi}{2} ) to ( frac{pi}{2} ). But in polar coordinates, angles are usually taken from 0 to ( 2pi ), so we can adjust this to ( theta in [0, pi] ) because ( sintheta ) is positive in both the first and second quadrants.Wait, no. Let me think again. When ( P ) is on the upper half of ( C_1 ), which is centered at ( (-2, 0) ), rotating it clockwise by ( frac{pi}{2} ) would move it to the right half of the circle ( C_2 ). So, the angle ( theta ) for ( C_2 ) would be from ( 0 ) to ( pi ), but since ( C_2 ) is a full circle, but only the part corresponding to ( P ) on ( C_1 ) is considered.Wait, actually, ( C_1 ) is only the upper half, so ( C_2 ) would be a semicircle as well. Let me check the parametric equations again.From the parametric equations of ( C_2 ):[x' = 2sinalpha][y' = 2 - 2cosalpha]with ( alpha in [0, pi] ).When ( alpha = 0 ):[x' = 0, quad y' = 2 - 2(1) = 0]So, point ( (0, 0) ).When ( alpha = frac{pi}{2} ):[x' = 2(1) = 2, quad y' = 2 - 2(0) = 2]So, point ( (2, 2) ).When ( alpha = pi ):[x' = 2(0) = 0, quad y' = 2 - 2(-1) = 4]So, point ( (0, 4) ).So, ( C_2 ) is a semicircle from ( (0, 0) ) to ( (0, 4) ) passing through ( (2, 2) ). Therefore, in polar coordinates, ( rho = 4 sintheta ) with ( theta in [0, pi] ).But wait, when ( theta = 0 ), ( rho = 0 ), which is the origin, and when ( theta = frac{pi}{2} ), ( rho = 4 ), which is the point ( (0, 4) ). But our parametric equations show that ( C_2 ) goes from ( (0, 0) ) to ( (0, 4) ), so the angle ( theta ) should range from 0 to ( frac{pi}{2} ), because beyond ( frac{pi}{2} ), the points would be on the left side, but our parametric equations only cover the right side.Wait, no. Let me plot it mentally. The parametric equations for ( C_2 ) are ( x' = 2sinalpha ) and ( y' = 2 - 2cosalpha ). As ( alpha ) goes from 0 to ( pi ), ( x' ) goes from 0 to 2 and back to 0, while ( y' ) goes from 0 to 4. So, it's a semicircle in the right half-plane, from ( (0, 0) ) up to ( (0, 4) ).In polar coordinates, this corresponds to ( rho = 4 sintheta ) but only for ( theta ) from 0 to ( frac{pi}{2} ), because beyond ( frac{pi}{2} ), ( x' ) would become negative, which isn't covered by our parametric equations.So, the polar equation is ( rho = 4 sintheta ) with ( theta in [0, frac{pi}{2}] ).Okay, that seems consistent.Now, part (2): Given point ( F(0, -1) ), the line ( sqrt{3}x - y - 1 = 0 ) intersects ( C_2 ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). Find ( |FA| + |FB| ).First, let me write the equation of ( C_2 ) in Cartesian coordinates, which we found earlier as:[x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4]with ( x geq 0 ) because it's the right half of the circle.The line is ( sqrt{3}x - y - 1 = 0 ), which can be rewritten as ( y = sqrt{3}x - 1 ).We need to find the points of intersection between this line and ( C_2 ). So, substitute ( y = sqrt{3}x - 1 ) into the circle equation:[x^2 + (sqrt{3}x - 1 - 2)^2 = 4]Simplify:[x^2 + (sqrt{3}x - 3)^2 = 4]Expand ( (sqrt{3}x - 3)^2 ):[3x^2 - 6sqrt{3}x + 9]So, the equation becomes:[x^2 + 3x^2 - 6sqrt{3}x + 9 = 4]Combine like terms:[4x^2 - 6sqrt{3}x + 5 = 0]This is a quadratic equation in ( x ). Let me write it as:[4x^2 - 6sqrt{3}x + 5 = 0]Let me compute the discriminant ( D ):[D = ( -6sqrt{3} )^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot 5 = 108 - 80 = 28]So, the solutions are:[x = frac{6sqrt{3} pm sqrt{28}}{8} = frac{6sqrt{3} pm 2sqrt{7}}{8} = frac{3sqrt{3} pm sqrt{7}}{4}]So, the x-coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ) are ( frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} ) and ( frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} ).Now, let's find the corresponding y-coordinates using ( y = sqrt{3}x - 1 ):For ( x = frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} ):[y = sqrt{3} cdot frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} - 1 = frac{3 cdot 3 + sqrt{21}}{4} - 1 = frac{9 + sqrt{21}}{4} - 1 = frac{9 + sqrt{21} - 4}{4} = frac{5 + sqrt{21}}{4}]For ( x = frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} ):[y = sqrt{3} cdot frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} - 1 = frac{9 - sqrt{21}}{4} - 1 = frac{9 - sqrt{21} - 4}{4} = frac{5 - sqrt{21}}{4}]So, points ( A ) and ( B ) are:[Aleft( frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4}, frac{5 + sqrt{21}}{4} right)][Bleft( frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4}, frac{5 - sqrt{21}}{4} right)]Now, we need to find ( |FA| + |FB| ), where ( F(0, -1) ).Let's compute the distances ( |FA| ) and ( |FB| ).First, ( |FA| ):[|FA| = sqrt{ left( frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} - 0 right)^2 + left( frac{5 + sqrt{21}}{4} - (-1) right)^2 }]Simplify:[= sqrt{ left( frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} right)^2 + left( frac{5 + sqrt{21} + 4}{4} right)^2 }][= sqrt{ left( frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} right)^2 + left( frac{9 + sqrt{21}}{4} right)^2 }]Similarly, ( |FB| ):[|FB| = sqrt{ left( frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} - 0 right)^2 + left( frac{5 - sqrt{21}}{4} - (-1) right)^2 }]Simplify:[= sqrt{ left( frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} right)^2 + left( frac{5 - sqrt{21} + 4}{4} right)^2 }][= sqrt{ left( frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} right)^2 + left( frac{9 - sqrt{21}}{4} right)^2 }]This looks complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute ( |FA| + |FB| ) without calculating each distance separately.Let me recall that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots is ( -b/a ) and the product is ( c/a ). In our case, the quadratic equation in ( x ) was:[4x^2 - 6sqrt{3}x + 5 = 0]So, the sum of the roots ( x_A + x_B = frac{6sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} )And the product ( x_A x_B = frac{5}{4} )Similarly, for the y-coordinates, since ( y = sqrt{3}x - 1 ), the sum of the y-coordinates is:[y_A + y_B = sqrt{3}(x_A + x_B) - 2 = sqrt{3} cdot frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} - 2 = frac{9}{2} - 2 = frac{5}{2}]And the product:[y_A y_B = (sqrt{3}x_A - 1)(sqrt{3}x_B - 1) = 3x_Ax_B - sqrt{3}(x_A + x_B) + 1 = 3 cdot frac{5}{4} - sqrt{3} cdot frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 = frac{15}{4} - frac{9}{2} + 1 = frac{15}{4} - frac{18}{4} + frac{4}{4} = frac{1}{4}]Now, let's express ( |FA| + |FB| ). Since ( F(0, -1) ), the distance from ( F ) to a point ( (x, y) ) is:[sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - (-1))^2} = sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2}]So, ( |FA| + |FB| = sqrt{x_A^2 + (y_A + 1)^2} + sqrt{x_B^2 + (y_B + 1)^2} )Let me compute ( y_A + 1 ) and ( y_B + 1 ):[y_A + 1 = frac{5 + sqrt{21}}{4} + 1 = frac{5 + sqrt{21} + 4}{4} = frac{9 + sqrt{21}}{4}][y_B + 1 = frac{5 - sqrt{21}}{4} + 1 = frac{5 - sqrt{21} + 4}{4} = frac{9 - sqrt{21}}{4}]So, ( |FA| = sqrt{ left( frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} right)^2 + left( frac{9 + sqrt{21}}{4} right)^2 } )Similarly, ( |FB| = sqrt{ left( frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} right)^2 + left( frac{9 - sqrt{21}}{4} right)^2 } )This still looks messy. Maybe there's a property or theorem that can help simplify this.Wait, I remember that for a circle, the sum of distances from a point on the circle to two fixed points can sometimes be related to the diameter or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the property of the circle and the line intersecting it.Alternatively, perhaps using parametric forms or vectors.Wait, another idea: since ( C_2 ) is a circle with center ( (0, 2) ) and radius 2, and point ( F(0, -1) ) is below the circle. The line intersects the circle at ( A ) and ( B ). Maybe we can use the power of a point or something related.The power of point ( F ) with respect to circle ( C_2 ) is:[text{Power} = |FO|^2 - r^2 = (0^2 + (-1 - 2)^2) - 2^2 = (9) - 4 = 5]But the power is also equal to ( |FA| cdot |FB| ). Wait, no, the power is equal to ( |FA| cdot |FB| ) if ( F ) lies outside the circle and ( AB ) is the secant line. But in our case, ( F ) is inside the circle because the distance from ( F ) to the center ( (0, 2) ) is 3, which is greater than the radius 2, so ( F ) is outside.Wait, no, ( F(0, -1) ) is 3 units below the center ( (0, 2) ), so the distance from ( F ) to the center is ( sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 2)^2} = 3 ), which is greater than the radius 2, so ( F ) is outside the circle. Therefore, the power of ( F ) with respect to ( C_2 ) is:[|FA| cdot |FB| = text{Power} = |FO|^2 - r^2 = 3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5]But we need ( |FA| + |FB| ), not the product. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe using the fact that ( |FA| + |FB| ) is related to the length of the chord or something else.Wait, another approach: parametrize the line and use vector methods.The line ( sqrt{3}x - y - 1 = 0 ) can be parametrized. Let me set ( x = t ), then ( y = sqrt{3}t - 1 ). So, the parametric equations are:[x = t, quad y = sqrt{3}t - 1]Substitute into ( C_2 )'s equation:[t^2 + (sqrt{3}t - 1 - 2)^2 = 4]Which simplifies to:[t^2 + (sqrt{3}t - 3)^2 = 4]Expanding:[t^2 + 3t^2 - 6sqrt{3}t + 9 = 4]Combine like terms:[4t^2 - 6sqrt{3}t + 5 = 0]Which is the same quadratic as before. So, the solutions are ( t = frac{3sqrt{3} pm sqrt{7}}{4} ), which are the x-coordinates of ( A ) and ( B ).Now, considering the parametrization ( x = t ), ( y = sqrt{3}t - 1 ), the points ( A ) and ( B ) correspond to parameters ( t_1 = frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} ) and ( t_2 = frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} ).Now, the distance from ( F(0, -1) ) to a general point on the line can be expressed in terms of ( t ). Let me compute ( |FP| ) where ( P(t, sqrt{3}t - 1) ):[|FP| = sqrt{(t - 0)^2 + (sqrt{3}t - 1 - (-1))^2} = sqrt{t^2 + (sqrt{3}t)^2} = sqrt{t^2 + 3t^2} = sqrt{4t^2} = 2|t|]Wait, that's interesting! So, the distance from ( F ) to any point ( P ) on the line is ( 2|t| ). Therefore, for points ( A ) and ( B ), their distances to ( F ) are ( 2|t_1| ) and ( 2|t_2| ).But since ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ) are both positive (because ( sqrt{3} ) and ( sqrt{7} ) are positive), we can drop the absolute value:[|FA| = 2t_1 = 2 cdot frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{2}][|FB| = 2t_2 = 2 cdot frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{2}]Therefore, ( |FA| + |FB| = frac{3sqrt{3} + sqrt{7}}{2} + frac{3sqrt{3} - sqrt{7}}{2} = frac{6sqrt{3}}{2} = 3sqrt{3} )Wow, that simplifies nicely! So, the sum of the distances is ( 3sqrt{3} ).I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.We had the circle ( C_2 ) with equation ( x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4 ). The line ( sqrt{3}x - y - 1 = 0 ) intersects this circle at points ( A ) and ( B ). By parametrizing the line and substituting into the circle's equation, we found the x-coordinates of ( A ) and ( B ) as ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ). Then, realizing that the distance from ( F ) to any point on the line is ( 2|t| ), we computed ( |FA| + |FB| ) as ( 2(t_1 + t_2) ). Since ( t_1 + t_2 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} ), the sum becomes ( 3sqrt{3} ).Yes, that makes sense. I think I'm confident with this answer."},{"question":"From the diagram, find the positive difference in the x-coordinates when lines l and m reach y = 20.

Determine the range of x.A: (-1, ‚àö2)B: (1, ‚àö2)C: (-1, 1]D: (-1, 2)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Given the function f(t) = 2sin(t), where t is in the interval [œÄ/6, œÄ/2]. For all real numbers m within the range of f(t), the inequality 2x¬≤ + mx - 2 < m + 2x always holds true. I need to determine the range of x. The options are A: (-1, ‚àö2), B: (1, ‚àö2), C: (-1, 1], D: (-1, 2).Okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to find the range of the function f(t) = 2sin(t) when t is between œÄ/6 and œÄ/2. Since sine of œÄ/6 is 1/2 and sine of œÄ/2 is 1, multiplying by 2 gives us the range of f(t) as [1, 2]. So, m is any real number between 1 and 2.Now, the inequality given is 2x¬≤ + mx - 2 < m + 2x. I need to rearrange this inequality so that it's easier to analyze. Let me subtract m and 2x from both sides to get:2x¬≤ + mx - 2 - m - 2x < 0Simplify the terms:2x¬≤ + (m - 2)x - 2 - m < 0Hmm, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out m from the terms that have it. Let's see:2x¬≤ + m(x - 1) - 2 - 2x < 0Wait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Alternatively, maybe I can group the terms differently:2x¬≤ - 2x + m(x - 1) - 2 < 0Yes, that seems better. So, it's 2x¬≤ - 2x + m(x - 1) - 2 < 0. Let me write this as:m(x - 1) + 2x¬≤ - 2x - 2 < 0Okay, so this is a linear inequality in terms of m. Since m is between 1 and 2, for the inequality to hold for all m in [1, 2], the expression m(x - 1) + 2x¬≤ - 2x - 2 must be less than 0 for all m in that interval.This reminds me of a linear function in m. If I think of this as g(m) = m(x - 1) + (2x¬≤ - 2x - 2), then g(m) is a linear function in m. For g(m) to be less than 0 for all m in [1, 2], the maximum value of g(m) on this interval must be less than 0.Since g(m) is linear, its maximum occurs at one of the endpoints, either at m = 1 or m = 2. Therefore, I need to ensure that both g(1) < 0 and g(2) < 0.Let's compute g(1):g(1) = 1*(x - 1) + 2x¬≤ - 2x - 2= x - 1 + 2x¬≤ - 2x - 2= 2x¬≤ - x - 3Similarly, compute g(2):g(2) = 2*(x - 1) + 2x¬≤ - 2x - 2= 2x - 2 + 2x¬≤ - 2x - 2= 2x¬≤ - 4So, now I have two inequalities:1. 2x¬≤ - x - 3 < 02. 2x¬≤ - 4 < 0Let's solve each inequality separately.Starting with the second inequality because it looks simpler:2x¬≤ - 4 < 0Divide both sides by 2:x¬≤ - 2 < 0So, x¬≤ < 2Taking square roots:|x| < ‚àö2Which means:-‚àö2 < x < ‚àö2Okay, so that's one condition. Now, let's solve the first inequality:2x¬≤ - x - 3 < 0This is a quadratic inequality. Let's find the roots of the quadratic equation 2x¬≤ - x - 3 = 0.Using the quadratic formula:x = [1 ¬± ‚àö(1 + 24)] / 4= [1 ¬± ‚àö25] / 4= [1 ¬± 5] / 4So, the roots are:x = (1 + 5)/4 = 6/4 = 3/2 = 1.5x = (1 - 5)/4 = (-4)/4 = -1Therefore, the quadratic can be factored as 2(x + 1)(x - 1.5) < 0.To determine where the quadratic is negative, we can analyze the sign changes around the roots x = -1 and x = 1.5.The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of x¬≤ is positive), so it will be below zero between its roots.Thus, the solution to 2x¬≤ - x - 3 < 0 is:-1 < x < 1.5Now, combining both inequalities:From the second inequality: -‚àö2 < x < ‚àö2From the first inequality: -1 < x < 1.5So, the intersection of these two intervals is:-1 < x < 1.5But wait, ‚àö2 is approximately 1.414, which is less than 1.5. So, actually, the intersection is:-1 < x < ‚àö2Because ‚àö2 is approximately 1.414, which is less than 1.5, so the upper bound is determined by ‚àö2.Therefore, the range of x is (-1, ‚àö2).Looking back at the options, option A is (-1, ‚àö2), so that should be the correct answer.But just to make sure, let me double-check my steps.1. Found the range of f(t) correctly as [1, 2].2. Rearranged the inequality correctly to m(x - 1) + 2x¬≤ - 2x - 2 < 0.3. Recognized that for the inequality to hold for all m in [1, 2], both endpoints must satisfy the inequality.4. Calculated g(1) and g(2) correctly.5. Solved the quadratic inequalities accurately.6. Found the intersection of the intervals correctly.Everything seems to check out. So, I'm confident that the answer is A: (-1, ‚àö2).**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"In an office, there are some employees and 25% of the total employees are males. 40% of the males in the office are at least 50 years old. There are 120 males aged below 50 years. How many employees are there in the office?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of employees in the office. Let's denote the total number of employees as ( E ).Given that 25% of the total employees are males, the number of male employees can be expressed as ( 0.25E ).Next, it's stated that 40% of the males are at least 50 years old. This means that 60% of the males are below 50 years old.We know there are 120 males aged below 50 years. This represents 60% of the total male employees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:[0.60 times (0.25E) = 120]Simplifying the equation:[0.15E = 120]To find ( E ), divide both sides by 0.15:[E = frac{120}{0.15} = 800]Thus, the total number of employees in the office is 800."},{"question":"The length of a rectangle is increased by 40% while its width is halved. What is the percentage change in area?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"The length of a rectangle is increased by 40% while its width is halved. What is the percentage change in area?\\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if either the length or the width changes, the area will change accordingly. In this case, both the length and the width are being altered, so I need to see how these changes affect the overall area.Let me denote the original length as ( L ) and the original width as ( W ). Therefore, the original area ( A_{text{original}} ) is:[ A_{text{original}} = L times W ]Now, the problem states that the length is increased by 40%. Increasing something by 40% means you're adding 40% of its original value to itself. So, the new length ( L_{text{new}} ) would be:[ L_{text{new}} = L + 0.40L = 1.40L ]Okay, that makes sense. So, the new length is 1.4 times the original length.Next, the width is halved. Halving something means dividing it by 2. So, the new width ( W_{text{new}} ) is:[ W_{text{new}} = frac{W}{2} ]Alright, now I need to find the new area with these updated dimensions. The new area ( A_{text{new}} ) would be:[ A_{text{new}} = L_{text{new}} times W_{text{new}} = 1.40L times frac{W}{2} ]Let me compute that:[ A_{text{new}} = 1.40L times frac{W}{2} = 0.70LW ]So, the new area is 0.70 times the original area. That means the area has decreased.To find the percentage change in area, I can use the formula:[ text{Percentage Change} = frac{A_{text{new}} - A_{text{original}}}{A_{text{original}}} times 100% ]Plugging in the values I have:[ text{Percentage Change} = frac{0.70LW - LW}{LW} times 100% ]Simplifying the numerator:[ 0.70LW - LW = -0.30LW ]So, the percentage change becomes:[ text{Percentage Change} = frac{-0.30LW}{LW} times 100% = -0.30 times 100% = -30% ]A negative percentage change indicates a decrease in area. Therefore, the area has decreased by 30%.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the original area ( LW ), increasing the length by 40% gives ( 1.40L ), and halving the width gives ( 0.50W ). Multiplying these together:[ 1.40L times 0.50W = 0.70LW ]Yes, that's correct. So, the new area is indeed 70% of the original area, which means a 30% decrease. That seems right.I think I've got it. The area decreases by 30% when the length is increased by 40% and the width is halved."},{"question":"Compute the determinant of the following matrix:[begin{vmatrix} 3 & 0 & -2  5 & 6 & -4  3 & 3 & 7 end{vmatrix}.]","answer":"Okay, so I need to compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix:[begin{vmatrix} 3 & 0 & -2  5 & 6 & -4  3 & 3 & 7 end{vmatrix}]Hmm, determinants. I remember that for a 3x3 matrix, one way to calculate it is by expanding along a row or column using minors and cofactors. The user mentioned expanding along the first row, so I'll try that method.First, let me recall the formula for expanding a determinant along the first row. For a matrix:[begin{vmatrix}a & b & c d & e & f g & h & iend{vmatrix}]The determinant is calculated as:[a cdot begin{vmatrix} e & f  h & i end{vmatrix} - b cdot begin{vmatrix} d & f  g & i end{vmatrix} + c cdot begin{vmatrix} d & e  g & h end{vmatrix}]So, applying this to our matrix:- The element in the first row, first column is 3. Its minor is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the first row and first column:[begin{vmatrix} 6 & -4  3 & 7 end{vmatrix}]- The element in the first row, second column is 0. Its minor is:[begin{vmatrix} 5 & -4  3 & 7 end{vmatrix}]But since this element is 0, the entire term will be 0, so I can skip calculating this minor.- The element in the first row, third column is -2. Its minor is:[begin{vmatrix} 5 & 6  3 & 3 end{vmatrix}]So, putting it all together, the determinant should be:[3 cdot begin{vmatrix} 6 & -4  3 & 7 end{vmatrix} - 0 cdot begin{vmatrix} 5 & -4  3 & 7 end{vmatrix} + (-2) cdot begin{vmatrix} 5 & 6  3 & 3 end{vmatrix}]Simplifying, since the middle term is 0, we have:[3 cdot begin{vmatrix} 6 & -4  3 & 7 end{vmatrix} - 2 cdot begin{vmatrix} 5 & 6  3 & 3 end{vmatrix}]Now, I need to compute these 2x2 determinants.Starting with the first minor:[begin{vmatrix} 6 & -4  3 & 7 end{vmatrix}]The determinant of a 2x2 matrix (begin{vmatrix} a & b  c & d end{vmatrix}) is (ad - bc). So, applying that here:[(6)(7) - (-4)(3) = 42 - (-12) = 42 + 12 = 54]Okay, that gives me 54. Now, the second minor:[begin{vmatrix} 5 & 6  3 & 3 end{vmatrix}]Again, using the same formula:[(5)(3) - (6)(3) = 15 - 18 = -3]So, that minor is -3.Now, plugging these back into the original expression:[3 cdot 54 - 2 cdot (-3)]Calculating each term:- (3 cdot 54 = 162)- (-2 cdot (-3) = 6)Adding these together:[162 + 6 = 168]So, the determinant of the matrix is 168.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First minor: 6*7=42, -4*3=-12, 42 - (-12)=54. That seems correct.Second minor: 5*3=15, 6*3=18, 15-18=-3. That also looks right.Then, 3*54=162, -2*(-3)=6, 162+6=168. Yep, that all adds up.I think I did it correctly. So, the determinant is 168."},{"question":"A jogger running at 9 km/hr alongside a railway track is 200 m ahead of the engine of a train running at 45 km/hr in the same direction. The train, which is a certain length, passes the jogger in 41 seconds. What is the length of the train in meters?","answer":"First, I need to convert the speeds of both the jogger and the train from kilometers per hour to meters per second to ensure consistent units.The jogger's speed is 9 km/hr, which converts to:9 km/hr = 9 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 2.5 m/sThe train's speed is 45 km/hr, which converts to:45 km/hr = 45 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 12.5 m/sNext, I calculate the relative speed between the train and the jogger since they are moving in the same direction. The relative speed is the difference between the train's speed and the jogger's speed:Relative speed = 12.5 m/s - 2.5 m/s = 10 m/sThe train passes the jogger in 41 seconds. During this time, the train covers a distance relative to the jogger, which is the product of the relative speed and the time:Distance covered = 10 m/s * 41 s = 410 mThis distance includes the initial 200-meter head start that the jogger had. Therefore, the length of the train is the total distance covered minus the initial head start:Length of train = 410 m - 200 m = 210 mThus, the length of the train is 210 meters."},{"question":"In a building, there are some rooms, each having an equal area.

Hmm, I need to find the two distinct solutions, a and b, where a is greater than b, and then find the difference a - b. Alright, let me break this down step by step.First, I remember that (x - 5)(x + 5) is a difference of squares, which simplifies to x¬≤ - 25. So, I can rewrite the equation as:x¬≤ - 25 = 26x - 130.Now, I want to get all terms on one side to form a quadratic equation. Let me subtract 26x and add 130 to both sides:x¬≤ - 26x + 105 = 0.Alright, so now I have a quadratic equation: x¬≤ - 26x + 105 = 0. I need to solve for x. There are a few methods to solve quadratic equations: factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me see if this can be factored easily.I need two numbers that multiply to 105 and add up to -26. Let me think about the factors of 105. 105 can be factored into 1 and 105, 3 and 35, 5 and 21, 7 and 15. Hmm, 7 and 15 add up to 22, which isn't 26. 5 and 21 add up to 26. Wait, but since the middle term is -26x, both numbers should be negative because their product is positive and their sum is negative. So, -5 and -21. Let me check:-5 * -21 = 105, and -5 + (-21) = -26. Perfect!So, the quadratic factors as:(x - 5)(x - 21) = 0.Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:x - 5 = 0 => x = 5,x - 21 = 0 => x = 21.So, the two solutions are x = 5 and x = 21. Since a > b, a is 21 and b is 5. Therefore, the difference a - b is 21 - 5, which is 16.Wait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation:(x - 5)(x + 5) = 26x - 130.Expanding the left side: x¬≤ - 25. So, x¬≤ - 25 = 26x - 130.Moving all terms to the left: x¬≤ - 26x + 105 = 0.Factoring: (x - 5)(x - 21) = 0. Solutions: x = 5 and x = 21. Difference: 21 - 5 = 16.Everything seems to check out.

This \\"densification\\" was repeated two more times (a total of 3 times). As a result, there were 113 points marked on the line. How many points were originally marked?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about points on a line and densification. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. First, the problem says that several points were marked on a line. Then, a point was marked between each pair of neighboring points. This process was repeated two more times, making it a total of three times. After all that densification, there were 113 points on the line. The question is asking how many points were originally marked.Okay, so let's break this down. Initially, there are some points on a line. Let's call the number of original points ( n ). Then, each time we densify, we're adding a point between every two neighboring points. So, if I have two points, after densification, I'll have three points. If I have three points, after densification, I'll have five points, right? Because between each pair, I'm adding one more.Wait, actually, let me think about that again. If I have ( n ) points, how many gaps are there between them? It should be ( n - 1 ) gaps, right? Because between the first and second, second and third, and so on, up to the ( (n-1) )-th and ( n )-th point. So, if I add a point in each of these gaps, I'll be adding ( n - 1 ) points. Therefore, the total number of points after densification would be the original ( n ) plus ( n - 1 ), which is ( 2n - 1 ).So, each time we densify, the number of points becomes ( 2n - 1 ). That makes sense. Let me test this with a small number. If I start with 2 points, after densification, I should have ( 2*2 - 1 = 3 ) points. Yep, that works. If I start with 3 points, after densification, it should be ( 2*3 - 1 = 5 ) points. That also works. Okay, so this formula seems correct.Now, the problem says that this densification was repeated two more times, so a total of three times. After three densifications, there are 113 points. We need to find the original number of points.Hmm, so we need to work backwards. Let's denote the number of points after each densification as follows:- After the first densification: ( n_1 = 2n - 1 )- After the second densification: ( n_2 = 2n_1 - 1 )- After the third densification: ( n_3 = 2n_2 - 1 )And we know that ( n_3 = 113 ). So, we can set up the equations and solve for ( n ).Let me write this out step by step.Starting from the end:1. After the third densification: ( n_3 = 113 )2. Before the third densification (which is after the second densification): ( n_2 = frac{n_3 + 1}{2} )   - Because ( n_3 = 2n_2 - 1 ), so solving for ( n_2 ) gives ( n_2 = frac{n_3 + 1}{2} )3. Similarly, before the second densification (which is after the first densification): ( n_1 = frac{n_2 + 1}{2} )4. And before the first densification (which is the original number of points): ( n = frac{n_1 + 1}{2} )So, let's compute each step.First, ( n_3 = 113 )Then, ( n_2 = frac{113 + 1}{2} = frac{114}{2} = 57 )Next, ( n_1 = frac{57 + 1}{2} = frac{58}{2} = 29 )Finally, ( n = frac{29 + 1}{2} = frac{30}{2} = 15 )So, the original number of points was 15.Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with 15 points:- After first densification: ( 2*15 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 ) points- After second densification: ( 2*29 - 1 = 58 - 1 = 57 ) points- After third densification: ( 2*57 - 1 = 114 - 1 = 113 ) pointsYep, that checks out. So, the original number of points was indeed 15.I think that makes sense. Each time we densify, the number of points increases in a specific pattern, and by reversing that pattern, we can find the original number. It's like working backwards through each step, undoing the densification process.Just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors, let me go through the calculations again.Starting from 113:1. ( n_3 = 113 )2. ( n_2 = frac{113 + 1}{2} = 57 )3. ( n_1 = frac{57 + 1}{2} = 29 )4. ( n = frac{29 + 1}{2} = 15 )All the divisions are exact, which is good because you can't have a fraction of a point. So, each step results in an integer, which is necessary.Another way to think about it is that each densification roughly doubles the number of points, minus one. So, after three densifications, the number of points is roughly ( 2^3 ) times the original, minus some amount. But since we're working backwards, dividing by two each time and adding one makes sense.I think I've got it. The original number of points was 15."},{"question":"There are 3 positions to be filled by selecting from 4 college graduates.

Maybe I can use those concepts here.Let me think: if I have 4 graduates and 3 positions, and each position must have at least one person, how does that work? Well, if I have to assign at least one person to each position, that means I can't have any position left empty. So, I need to make sure that all 3 positions are filled.But wait, there are more graduates than positions. So, some positions might have more than one person, right? Or maybe not. The problem doesn't specify that a position can't have more than one person. It just says each position must select at least 1 person. So, it's possible that one position could have two people, and the other two positions have one each.Okay, so there are two scenarios here:1. Each position has exactly one person. That would mean selecting 3 graduates out of 4 and assigning each to a position.2. One position has two people, and the other two positions have one person each. That would mean selecting 4 graduates, assigning two to one position, and one each to the other two positions.I think I need to calculate the number of ways for each scenario and then add them together to get the total number of ways.Let's start with the first scenario: each position has exactly one person. So, I need to choose 3 graduates out of 4 and then assign them to the 3 positions.The number of ways to choose 3 graduates out of 4 is given by the combination formula:C(4, 3) = frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4Now, for each of these combinations, I need to assign the 3 graduates to the 3 positions. Since the positions are distinct, the order matters here. So, this is a permutation problem.The number of ways to arrange 3 graduates in 3 positions is:3! = 6So, the total number of ways for the first scenario is:C(4, 3) times 3! = 4 times 6 = 24Okay, that's 24 ways.Now, let's move on to the second scenario: one position has two people, and the other two positions have one person each. This seems a bit more complex.First, I need to decide which position will have two people. There are 3 positions, so there are 3 choices for this.Next, I need to select 2 graduates out of the 4 to assign to this position. The number of ways to do this is:C(4, 2) = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6Now, after selecting 2 graduates for the first position, I have 2 graduates left. These need to be assigned to the remaining 2 positions, one each. Since the positions are distinct, the order matters here as well.The number of ways to arrange 2 graduates in 2 positions is:2! = 2So, for each choice of the position that has two people, the number of ways is:C(4, 2) times 2! = 6 times 2 = 12But remember, there are 3 choices for which position has two people. So, the total number of ways for the second scenario is:3 times 12 = 36Alright, so the second scenario gives us 36 ways.Now, to find the total number of ways to select people for the positions, I need to add the number of ways from both scenarios:24 + 36 = 60So, there are 60 different ways to select the graduates for the positions under the given constraints.Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For the first scenario:- Choosing 3 out of 4: 4 ways.- Assigning them to 3 positions: 6 ways.- Total: 4 √ó 6 = 24. That seems correct.For the second scenario:- Choosing which position has two people: 3 ways.- Choosing 2 out of 4 graduates: 6 ways.- Assigning the remaining 2 graduates to the other positions: 2 ways.- Total for each position choice: 6 √ó 2 = 12.- Total for all position choices: 3 √ó 12 = 36. That also seems correct.Adding them together: 24 + 36 = 60. Yep, that looks right.I think I've covered all possible scenarios where each position has at least one person, and I accounted for both cases where each position has exactly one person and where one position has two people. So, I'm confident that the total number of ways is 60."},{"question":"in a group of 90 people , 55 have visited iceland and 33 have visited norway . if 51 people have visited both iceland and norway , how many people have visited neither country ?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many people have visited either Iceland or Norway.

Then log_{2} 81 = kx. Find k.","answer":"First, I need to understand the given equations: (log_{8} 3 = x) and (log_{2} 81 = kx). From the first equation, (log_{8} 3 = x), I can rewrite this in exponential form as (8^x = 3).Next, I look at the second equation, (log_{2} 81 = kx), which can be rewritten as (2^{kx} = 81).I recognize that 81 is (3^4), so I substitute this into the equation: (2^{kx} = 3^4).Since I already have (8^x = 3), I can express (3^4) as ((8^x)^4), which simplifies to (8^{4x}).Now, I rewrite (8^{4x}) using base 2: (8 = 2^3), so (8^{4x} = (2^3)^{4x} = 2^{12x}).This gives me the equation (2^{12x} = 2^{kx}). By comparing the exponents, I find that (12x = kx).Finally, solving for (k) gives (k = 12)."},{"question":"The value of the real number -sqrt{0.81} is ( )A: 0.9B: -0.9C: 0.3D: -0.3","answer":"Okay, so I have this math problem here: What is the value of the real number (-sqrt{0.81})? The options are A: 0.9, B: -0.9, C: 0.3, and D: -0.3. Hmm, let's see how I can figure this out. First, I remember that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, (sqrt{0.81}) should be a number that, when squared, equals 0.81. I'm trying to think of what number that could be. Maybe 0.9? Let me check: 0.9 times 0.9 is 0.81. Yeah, that works. So, (sqrt{0.81} = 0.9).But wait, the problem has a negative sign in front of the square root, so it's (-sqrt{0.81}). That means I need to take the square root of 0.81 first and then apply the negative sign. So, if (sqrt{0.81}) is 0.9, then (-sqrt{0.81}) would be -0.9. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, I get confused about whether the negative sign applies before or after taking the square root. But in this case, the negative sign is outside the square root symbol, so it should definitely be applied after finding the square root. Just to double-check, if I consider the square of -0.9, that would be (-0.9) * (-0.9) = 0.81, which matches the original number under the square root. So, that confirms that (sqrt{0.81}) is indeed 0.9, and the negative of that is -0.9. Looking back at the options, B is -0.9, which seems to be the correct answer. The other options don't make sense because 0.3 squared is 0.09, which is much smaller than 0.81, and 0.9 is positive, but we need a negative number here because of the negative sign in front of the square root.I think I've got it right. The value of (-sqrt{0.81}) is -0.9, so the answer should be B."},{"question":"Tom has thirteen slips of paper which he wants to put into five cups labeled A, B, C, D, E.

If 7.14 machines remain closed throughout the year, then the percentage decrease in the amount of profit of the shareholders is 12.5%. What are the establishment charges?","answer":"First, I need to determine the establishment charges of the company. I know that the company has 14 machines, with annual manufacturing costs of Rs 42,000 and an annual output of Rs 70,000. The output and manufacturing costs are directly proportional to the number of machines.When 7.14 machines are closed, the number of operational machines becomes 14 - 7.14 = 6.86 machines. I can calculate the new annual output by finding the proportion of operational machines:(6.86 / 14) * 70,000 = 0.49 * 70,000 = Rs 34,300.The original profit for the shareholders is 12.5% of the annual output:0.125 * 70,000 = Rs 8,750.With the decrease in the number of machines, the profit decreases by 12.5%:8,750 - (0.125 * 8,750) = Rs 7,656.25.Next, I calculate the new manufacturing costs with 6.86 machines:(6.86 / 14) * 42,000 = 0.49 * 42,000 = Rs 20,580.The total costs when 6.86 machines are operational include both manufacturing costs and establishment charges:Total costs = 20,580 + E.The total income when 6.86 machines are operational is the sum of the new output and the new profit:Total income = 34,300 + 7,656.25 = Rs 41,956.25.To ensure the company at least breaks even, the total costs must be equal to or less than the total income:20,580 + E ‚â§ 41,956.25.Solving for E:E ‚â§ 41,956.25 - 20,580E ‚â§ 21,376.25.Therefore, the establishment charges are Rs 21,376.25 or less."},{"question":"I had 60 in allowance money and spent it as indicated in the pie graph shown.

Compare the sizes of P_n and Q_n and prove your conclusion.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about two sequences, one geometric and one arithmetic. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, part (1) asks for the general formulas of the sequences {a_n} and {b_n}. Starting with the geometric sequence {a_n}. I know that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio, r. The first term is given as a‚ÇÅ = 2, and the third term is a‚ÇÉ = 18. Since it's a geometric sequence, the nth term is given by a_n = a‚ÇÅ * r^(n-1). So, for a‚ÇÉ, that would be a‚ÇÉ = 2 * r¬≤ = 18. Let me solve for r. 2 * r¬≤ = 18  Divide both sides by 2:  r¬≤ = 9  So, r = sqrt(9) = 3 or r = -3.Hmm, so the common ratio could be 3 or -3. But wait, there's another condition given: the sum of the first three terms of {a_n} is greater than 20. Let me check both possibilities.If r = 3:  a‚ÇÅ = 2, a‚ÇÇ = 2*3 = 6, a‚ÇÉ = 18  Sum = 2 + 6 + 18 = 26, which is greater than 20. That works.If r = -3:  a‚ÇÅ = 2, a‚ÇÇ = 2*(-3) = -6, a‚ÇÉ = 18  Sum = 2 + (-6) + 18 = 14, which is less than 20. That doesn't satisfy the condition.So, the common ratio must be 3. Therefore, the general formula for {a_n} is a_n = 2 * 3^(n-1).Now, moving on to the arithmetic sequence {b_n}. It's given that b‚ÇÅ = 2, and the sum of the first four terms of {b_n} is equal to the sum of the first three terms of {a_n}, which we found to be 26.In an arithmetic sequence, each term is the previous term plus a common difference, d. The nth term is given by b_n = b‚ÇÅ + (n-1)d.The sum of the first four terms of {b_n} is b‚ÇÅ + b‚ÇÇ + b‚ÇÉ + b‚ÇÑ. Let me write that out:b‚ÇÅ + (b‚ÇÅ + d) + (b‚ÇÅ + 2d) + (b‚ÇÅ + 3d) = 4b‚ÇÅ + 6d.We know this sum equals 26, so:4b‚ÇÅ + 6d = 26  Given b‚ÇÅ = 2, substitute that in:  4*2 + 6d = 26  8 + 6d = 26  Subtract 8 from both sides:  6d = 18  Divide by 6:  d = 3.So, the common difference is 3. Therefore, the general formula for {b_n} is b_n = 2 + (n-1)*3. Simplifying that:b_n = 2 + 3n - 3  b_n = 3n - 1.Alright, that takes care of part (1). Now, part (2) is a bit more involved. It defines two new sequences, P_n and Q_n, which are sums of specific terms from {b_n}, and asks to compare their sizes.First, let's parse the definitions:P_n is the sum of b‚ÇÅ + b‚ÇÑ + b‚Çá + ... + b_{3n-2}. So, it's the sum of terms where the index increases by 3 each time, starting from 1, up to 3n-2.Similarly, Q_n is the sum of b_{10} + b_{12} + b_{14} + ... + b_{2n+8}. This is the sum of terms where the index increases by 2 each time, starting from 10, up to 2n+8.I need to find expressions for P_n and Q_n and then compare them.Let me start with P_n. Looking at the indices: 1, 4, 7, ..., 3n-2. This is an arithmetic sequence of indices with a common difference of 3. The first term is 1, the last term is 3n-2. How many terms are there? Let's see. The nth term of the index sequence is 1 + (k-1)*3 = 3k - 2. So, when 3k - 2 = 3n - 2, k = n. So, there are n terms in P_n.Each term in P_n is b_{3k-2} where k goes from 1 to n.Since {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence with b_n = 3n - 1, then b_{3k-2} = 3*(3k - 2) - 1 = 9k - 6 - 1 = 9k - 7.So, P_n is the sum from k=1 to n of (9k - 7). Let me write that as:P_n = Œ£_{k=1}^n (9k - 7)  = 9 Œ£_{k=1}^n k - 7 Œ£_{k=1}^n 1  = 9*(n(n+1)/2) - 7n  = (9n(n+1))/2 - 7n  Let me simplify that:First, expand 9n(n+1)/2:  = (9n¬≤ + 9n)/2Then subtract 7n:  = (9n¬≤ + 9n)/2 - (14n)/2  = (9n¬≤ + 9n - 14n)/2  = (9n¬≤ - 5n)/2  So, P_n = (9n¬≤ - 5n)/2.Alright, now moving on to Q_n.Q_n is the sum of b_{10} + b_{12} + b_{14} + ... + b_{2n+8}. Looking at the indices: 10, 12, 14, ..., 2n+8. This is an arithmetic sequence of indices with a common difference of 2. The first term is 10, the last term is 2n+8.How many terms are there? Let's see. The kth term of the index sequence is 10 + (k-1)*2 = 2k + 8. So, when 2k + 8 = 2n + 8, 2k = 2n, so k = n. So, there are n terms in Q_n.Each term in Q_n is b_{2k+8} where k goes from 1 to n.Since {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence with b_n = 3n - 1, then b_{2k+8} = 3*(2k + 8) - 1 = 6k + 24 - 1 = 6k + 23.So, Q_n is the sum from k=1 to n of (6k + 23). Let me write that as:Q_n = Œ£_{k=1}^n (6k + 23)  = 6 Œ£_{k=1}^n k + 23 Œ£_{k=1}^n 1  = 6*(n(n+1)/2) + 23n  = 3n(n+1) + 23n  = 3n¬≤ + 3n + 23n  = 3n¬≤ + 26n.So, Q_n = 3n¬≤ + 26n.Now, I need to compare P_n and Q_n. Let's write their expressions again:P_n = (9n¬≤ - 5n)/2  Q_n = 3n¬≤ + 26n.To compare them, let's compute P_n - Q_n:P_n - Q_n = (9n¬≤ - 5n)/2 - (3n¬≤ + 26n)  = (9n¬≤ - 5n)/2 - (6n¬≤ + 52n)/2  = (9n¬≤ - 5n - 6n¬≤ - 52n)/2  = (3n¬≤ - 57n)/2  = (3n(n - 19))/2.So, P_n - Q_n = (3n(n - 19))/2.Now, let's analyze this expression:- When n = 19: P_n - Q_n = 0. So, P_n = Q_n.- When n > 19: The term (n - 19) is positive, so P_n - Q_n is positive. Therefore, P_n > Q_n.- When n < 19: The term (n - 19) is negative, so P_n - Q_n is negative. Therefore, P_n < Q_n.So, summarizing:- For n = 19, P_n = Q_n.- For n > 19, P_n > Q_n.- For n < 19, P_n < Q_n.Therefore, depending on the value of n, P_n can be greater than, equal to, or less than Q_n.Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with P_n:- Indices: 1,4,7,...,3n-2. Number of terms: n. Each term: 9k -7. Sum: 9*(n(n+1)/2) -7n = (9n¬≤ +9n)/2 -7n = (9n¬≤ +9n -14n)/2 = (9n¬≤ -5n)/2. That seems correct.For Q_n:- Indices:10,12,...,2n+8. Number of terms: n. Each term:6k +23. Sum:6*(n(n+1)/2) +23n =3n(n+1) +23n=3n¬≤ +3n +23n=3n¬≤ +26n. That also seems correct.Difference: (9n¬≤ -5n)/2 - (3n¬≤ +26n)= (9n¬≤ -5n -6n¬≤ -52n)/2=(3n¬≤ -57n)/2=3n(n -19)/2. Correct.So, the conclusion is accurate.**Final Answer**(1) The general formulas are boxed{a_n = 2 cdot 3^{n-1}} and boxed{b_n = 3n - 1}.(2) For positive integers n, P_n is greater than Q_n when n geq 20, equal when n = 19, and less than when n leq 18.

The condition is that the curves y = Ax¬≤ + B and y = Cx¬≤ + D intersect. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, I know that for two curves to intersect, their equations must have at least one common solution. So, if I set Ax¬≤ + B equal to Cx¬≤ + D, that should give me the x-values where they intersect. Let me write that down:Ax¬≤ + B = Cx¬≤ + DIf I rearrange this equation, I get:(A - C)x¬≤ = D - BSo, for this equation to have a real solution, the right-hand side must be positive because x¬≤ is always non-negative. That means (D - B) and (A - C) must have the same sign. So, either both (D - B) and (A - C) are positive, or both are negative.Since A, B, C, D are all distinct numbers from 1 to 6, I need to consider how many ways I can choose these numbers such that either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B.Let me think about how to count these possibilities. Maybe I can separate the problem into two parts: choosing A and C, and then choosing B and D.First, let's choose A and C. There are 6 numbers, and I need to choose 2 distinct numbers. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct numbers from 6 is given by the combination formula:C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15So, there are 15 ways to choose A and C. Now, for each of these choices, A and C can be arranged in two ways: either A > C or A < C. But wait, since we're considering the sign of (A - C), each pair (A, C) will have one arrangement where A > C and another where A < C. So, for each pair, there are two possibilities.Similarly, for B and D, we have to choose 2 distinct numbers from the remaining 4 numbers (since A and C are already chosen). The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from 4 is:C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6Again, for each pair (B, D), there are two possibilities: either B > D or B < D.But wait, the problem says that the intersection is independent of the order of A, B, C, D. So, for example, choosing A=3, B=2, C=4, D=1 is the same as choosing A=4, B=1, C=3, D=2. So, I need to be careful not to double count these cases.Hmm, so maybe I should think of this as choosing two pairs: one pair (A, C) and another pair (B, D), and then for each pair, decide the order such that either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B.Let me try to formalize this. For each combination of two pairs (A, C) and (B, D), there are two possibilities for the ordering: either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B. So, for each combination of pairs, there are two valid configurations.So, the total number of ways would be the number of ways to choose the pairs (A, C) and (B, D) multiplied by 2 (for the two possible orderings).But wait, how many ways are there to choose the pairs (A, C) and (B, D)? Since A, B, C, D are all distinct, choosing (A, C) and (B, D) is equivalent to partitioning the 6 numbers into two groups of two and two, with the remaining two numbers being... Wait, no, actually, we have four numbers: A, B, C, D. So, we need to choose 4 distinct numbers from 6, and then partition them into two pairs: (A, C) and (B, D).So, first, choose 4 numbers out of 6. The number of ways to do this is C(6, 4) = 15.Then, for each set of 4 numbers, we need to partition them into two pairs. The number of ways to partition 4 distinct numbers into two pairs is 3. For example, if the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, the possible pairings are (1,2) and (3,4); (1,3) and (2,4); (1,4) and (2,3). So, 3 ways.Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the pairs is 15 * 3 = 45.But wait, hold on. Each of these pairings can be ordered in two ways: either (A, C) and (B, D), or (C, A) and (D, B). But since we're considering the curves y = Ax¬≤ + B and y = Cx¬≤ + D, switching A and C and switching B and D would result in the same pair of curves. So, we need to avoid double counting.Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Instead of considering the pairings, perhaps I should consider that for each selection of four distinct numbers, there are two possible assignments that satisfy the intersection condition.Wait, let me step back. The key is that for the curves to intersect, we need either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B. So, for each set of four distinct numbers, how many valid assignments of A, B, C, D satisfy this condition?Let me think about it. Suppose I have four distinct numbers: w, x, y, z, where w < x < y < z. How many ways can I assign these to A, B, C, D such that either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B.Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of permutations. For four distinct numbers, there are 4! = 24 permutations. But we need to count how many of these permutations satisfy either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B.But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for any four distinct numbers, the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of ways to choose two numbers for A and C, and the other two for B and D, such that either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B.So, for each set of four numbers, the number of valid assignments is 2 * (number of ways to choose A and C). Because for each choice of A and C, you can assign B and D in two ways to satisfy the condition.Wait, actually, for each set of four numbers, the number of valid assignments is 2 * C(4, 2). Because first, choose A and C (which can be any two numbers), and then assign B and D as the remaining two numbers. For each such choice, there are two possibilities: either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B.But wait, no. Because once you choose A and C, the assignment of B and D is fixed in terms of their order relative to A and C.Wait, maybe it's better to think that for each set of four numbers, the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of ways to choose A and C such that A ‚â† C, and then assign B and D such that D - B has the same sign as A - C.But this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about it as follows:Total number of ways to choose A, B, C, D without any restrictions is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 360. But since the order of A, B, C, D doesn't matter in terms of the curves (i.e., swapping A and C and swapping B and D gives the same pair of curves), we need to adjust for overcounting.Wait, no, actually, the problem says that the intersection is independent of the order of A, B, C, D. So, for example, choosing A=3, B=2, C=4, D=1 is the same as choosing A=4, B=1, C=3, D=2. So, these two assignments are considered the same.Therefore, we need to count the number of unordered pairs of curves that intersect.So, the total number of unordered pairs of curves is C(6, 2) for A and C, and C(4, 2) for B and D. But wait, no, because A, B, C, D are all distinct, so we need to choose four distinct numbers and then partition them into two pairs.So, as I thought earlier, the number of ways to choose four distinct numbers is C(6, 4) = 15. Then, for each set of four numbers, the number of ways to partition them into two pairs is 3. So, total number of unordered pairs is 15 * 3 = 45.But wait, each of these unordered pairs can be assigned in two ways to satisfy the intersection condition: either A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B. So, for each unordered pair, there are two valid assignments.Therefore, the total number of valid assignments is 45 * 2 = 90.Wait, but let me verify this. Suppose I have four numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4. The possible pairings are (1,2) and (3,4), (1,3) and (2,4), (1,4) and (2,3). For each pairing, I can assign A and C as the first pair and B and D as the second pair, or vice versa. But since the curves are unordered, assigning (A, C) as (1,2) and (B, D) as (3,4) is the same as assigning (A, C) as (3,4) and (B, D) as (1,2). So, actually, each unordered pair corresponds to two ordered assignments.But in terms of the intersection condition, for each unordered pair, there are two valid assignments: one where A > C and D > B, and one where A < C and D < B. So, for each unordered pair, there are two valid ordered assignments.Therefore, the total number of valid assignments is 45 * 2 = 90.But wait, let me think again. If I have four numbers, say 1, 2, 3, 4, and I pair them as (1,2) and (3,4). Then, assigning A=2, C=1 and B=4, D=3 would satisfy A > C and D > B. Alternatively, assigning A=1, C=2 and B=3, D=4 would satisfy A < C and D < B. So, for each unordered pair, there are two valid ordered assignments.Therefore, the total number of valid assignments is indeed 45 * 2 = 90.But wait, hold on. The problem says \\"different ways to choose A, B, C, D\\". Since the order of A, B, C, D doesn't matter in terms of the pair of curves, but each assignment is a specific choice of A, B, C, D. So, if we consider that swapping A and C and swapping B and D gives the same pair of curves, then each unordered pair corresponds to two ordered assignments.But in the problem statement, it says \\"the intersection of the curves is independent of the order of A, B, C, D\\". So, for example, A=3, B=2, C=4, D=1 and A=4, B=1, C=3, D=2 are considered the same. So, these two assignments are counted as one.Therefore, the total number of distinct ways is 90, considering that each unordered pair corresponds to two ordered assignments, but since they are considered the same, we don't need to multiply by 2 again.Wait, no. Let me clarify. If we have 45 unordered pairs of curves, each corresponding to two ordered assignments (A, B, C, D), but since the problem considers these two assignments as the same, then the total number of distinct ways is 45 * 2 / 2 = 45. But that can't be right because 45 is not one of the options.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently.Total number of ways to choose A, B, C, D without any restrictions is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 360. But since the order of A, B, C, D doesn't matter in terms of the pair of curves, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange A, B, C, D. However, since A and C are coefficients of x¬≤, and B and D are constants, swapping A and C and swapping B and D gives the same pair of curves. So, the number of distinct pairs is 360 / (2 * 2) = 90.But wait, that might not be accurate because not all assignments are valid. Only those where the curves intersect are counted. So, the total number of possible assignments is 360, but only those where (A - C) and (D - B) have the same sign are valid.So, how many of these 360 assignments satisfy the condition?For each assignment, the condition is that (A - C) and (D - B) have the same sign. So, either both positive or both negative.Let me think about it. For any assignment of A, B, C, D, the probability that (A - C) and (D - B) have the same sign is 1/2, because for any two distinct numbers, the difference can be positive or negative with equal probability, assuming uniform distribution.But wait, is that true? Actually, no, because the differences are not independent. For example, if A > C, then D must be > B for the curves to intersect. But the choices of A, C and B, D are not independent because all four numbers are distinct.Hmm, maybe a better approach is to count the number of valid assignments.Let me consider that for each set of four distinct numbers, there are 4! = 24 ways to assign them to A, B, C, D. For each such assignment, we can check if (A - C) and (D - B) have the same sign.But this seems tedious, but perhaps we can find a pattern.Alternatively, note that for any four distinct numbers, the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of ways to assign A, C such that A ‚â† C, and B, D such that B ‚â† D, and (A - C) and (D - B) have the same sign.But perhaps a better way is to realize that for any four distinct numbers, exactly half of the assignments will satisfy the condition (A - C) and (D - B) having the same sign, and the other half will have opposite signs.But is that true?Wait, let's take an example. Suppose we have four numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4.Total assignments: 24.Now, how many assignments satisfy (A - C) and (D - B) having the same sign?Let me try to count.First, choose A and C. There are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to choose A and C, and for each, two orderings: A > C or A < C.Similarly, for B and D, once A and C are chosen, there are two numbers left, so two orderings: B > D or B < D.Now, for each choice of A and C, and B and D, we can check if (A - C) and (D - B) have the same sign.But let's see:For each pair (A, C), if A > C, then for (D - B) to be positive, D must be > B. So, for each pair (A, C) with A > C, the number of valid (B, D) pairs is the number of ways to choose B and D such that D > B.Similarly, if A < C, then D must be < B.So, for each pair (A, C), regardless of their order, the number of valid (B, D) pairs is equal to the number of ways to choose B and D such that D > B if A > C, or D < B if A < C.But since for any two numbers, the number of ways to have D > B is equal to the number of ways to have D < B, which is 1 each for two numbers. Wait, no, for two numbers, there are two possible orderings: one where the first is greater, and one where the second is greater.So, for each pair (A, C), the number of valid (B, D) pairs is 1, because once you fix whether A > C or A < C, you have to choose B and D such that D > B or D < B accordingly, and there's only one way to do that for each case.Wait, no, actually, for each pair (A, C), once you fix whether A > C or A < C, the number of valid (B, D) pairs is equal to the number of ways to arrange B and D such that D > B or D < B, which is 1 each.Wait, no, for two numbers, say 1 and 2, there are two possible assignments: B=1, D=2 or B=2, D=1. So, for each pair (A, C), if A > C, then D must be > B, which can be achieved in one way (since B and D are the remaining two numbers, and only one of the two orderings satisfies D > B). Similarly, if A < C, then D must be < B, which is also one way.Therefore, for each pair (A, C), regardless of their order, there is exactly one valid assignment of B and D.But how many pairs (A, C) are there? For four numbers, there are C(4, 2) = 6 pairs. For each pair, there are two orderings: A > C or A < C. So, total of 12 ordered pairs.But for each ordered pair (A, C), there is exactly one valid assignment of B and D. So, total number of valid assignments is 12 * 1 = 12.But wait, total assignments for four numbers is 24, so 12 are valid and 12 are invalid. So, exactly half of the assignments satisfy the condition.Therefore, for each set of four distinct numbers, half of the 24 assignments are valid, which is 12.But wait, earlier I thought that for each set of four numbers, the number of valid assignments is 12, but the total number of assignments is 24, so 12 are valid.But in the problem, we are to count the number of distinct ways to choose A, B, C, D, considering that the order doesn't matter for the curves. So, each valid assignment is counted once, regardless of the order.Wait, no. The problem says \\"the intersection of the curves is independent of the order of A, B, C, D\\". So, for example, A=3, B=2, C=4, D=1 and A=4, B=1, C=3, D=2 are considered the same.Therefore, each pair of curves is counted once, regardless of the order of A, B, C, D.So, for each set of four numbers, how many distinct pairs of curves are there? It's the number of ways to partition the four numbers into two pairs (A, C) and (B, D), which is 3, as I thought earlier.But for each such partition, there are two valid assignments: one where A > C and D > B, and one where A < C and D < B. But since the pair of curves is considered the same regardless of the order, each partition corresponds to one distinct pair of curves.Wait, no. If you have a partition (A, C) and (B, D), and another partition (C, A) and (D, B), these are considered the same pair of curves. So, each partition corresponds to one distinct pair.But in terms of assignments, each partition can be assigned in two ways to satisfy the intersection condition.Wait, I'm getting confused again.Let me try a different approach. The total number of possible assignments is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 360. But since the order of A, B, C, D doesn't matter for the pair of curves, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange A, B, C, D. However, since swapping A and C and swapping B and D gives the same pair of curves, the number of distinct pairs is 360 / (2 * 2) = 90.But wait, this is the total number of distinct pairs of curves, regardless of whether they intersect or not. But the problem is asking for the number of distinct pairs that do intersect.So, if half of the assignments satisfy the intersection condition, then the number of intersecting pairs would be 90 / 2 = 45. But 45 is not one of the options. The options are 30, 60, 90, 180, 360.Wait, maybe my assumption that half of the assignments satisfy the condition is incorrect.Let me think again. For any four distinct numbers, the number of valid assignments where (A - C) and (D - B) have the same sign is equal to the number of ways to choose A, C such that A ‚â† C, and B, D such that B ‚â† D, and (A - C) and (D - B) have the same sign.But perhaps a better way is to realize that for any four distinct numbers, the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of ways to choose A, C such that A > C, and B, D such that D > B, plus the number of ways to choose A, C such that A < C, and B, D such that D < B.So, for each set of four numbers, the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of ways to choose A > C and D > B plus the number of ways to choose A < C and D < B.But how many ways are there to choose A > C and D > B?First, choose A and C such that A > C. The number of ways to choose A and C from four numbers with A > C is C(4, 2) = 6. For each such choice, the remaining two numbers are B and D, and we need to choose them such that D > B. The number of ways to choose B and D with D > B is 1 (since for two numbers, only one ordering satisfies D > B).Therefore, the number of ways to choose A > C and D > B is 6 * 1 = 6.Similarly, the number of ways to choose A < C and D < B is also 6.Therefore, for each set of four numbers, the number of valid assignments is 6 + 6 = 12.But the total number of assignments for four numbers is 24, so 12 are valid and 12 are invalid.Therefore, for each set of four numbers, half of the assignments are valid.So, the total number of valid assignments is (C(6, 4) * 12) = 15 * 12 = 180.But wait, this counts each assignment as ordered. However, the problem considers the pair of curves as unordered, meaning that swapping A and C and swapping B and D gives the same pair of curves. Therefore, each valid assignment is counted twice in the 180 total.Therefore, the number of distinct pairs of curves that intersect is 180 / 2 = 90.So, the answer should be 90, which is option C.But let me double-check. If I have four numbers, say 1, 2, 3, 4, the number of valid assignments is 12, but considering that swapping A and C and swapping B and D gives the same pair, each pair is counted twice. So, the number of distinct pairs is 12 / 2 = 6.But wait, earlier I thought that for each set of four numbers, there are 3 ways to partition into two pairs, and for each partition, two valid assignments, but considering the curves are unordered, each partition corresponds to one distinct pair.Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me try to clarify.If I have four numbers, the number of ways to partition them into two pairs is 3. For each partition, there are two valid assignments (A > C and D > B, or A < C and D < B). But since the pair of curves is considered the same regardless of the order, each partition corresponds to one distinct pair.Therefore, for each set of four numbers, the number of distinct pairs of curves that intersect is 3 * 2 / 2 = 3. Wait, no, because each partition can be assigned in two ways, but since the curves are unordered, each partition corresponds to one distinct pair.Wait, no, each partition can be assigned in two ways, but since the curves are unordered, each pair is counted once. So, for each set of four numbers, the number of distinct pairs is 3.But earlier, I thought that for each set of four numbers, the number of valid assignments is 12, but considering the curves are unordered, it's 6.Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to think of it as follows:Total number of ways to choose A, B, C, D with distinct values is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 360.Each pair of curves is determined by two distinct pairs: (A, C) and (B, D). Since the order of A, B, C, D doesn't matter, each pair of curves is counted multiple times in the 360 total.Specifically, each pair of curves can be represented in 2 * 2 = 4 ways (since A and C can be swapped, and B and D can be swapped). Therefore, the number of distinct pairs of curves is 360 / 4 = 90.Now, out of these 90 distinct pairs, how many intersect?From earlier, for each set of four numbers, half of the assignments satisfy the intersection condition. So, half of the 90 pairs intersect.Wait, no, because for each set of four numbers, the number of valid assignments is 12, which corresponds to 6 distinct pairs (since each pair is counted twice in the 12 assignments). So, for each set of four numbers, the number of intersecting pairs is 6.But since there are C(6, 4) = 15 sets of four numbers, the total number of intersecting pairs is 15 * 6 = 90.Therefore, the answer is 90, which is option C."},{"question":"Select some numbers from (1, 2, 3, ldots, 9, 10) so that each of the 20 numbers (1, 2, 3, ldots, 19, 20) is equal to one of the selected numbers or the sum of two selected numbers (they can be the same). How many numbers need to be selected at least?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to select some numbers from 1 to 10 such that every number from 1 to 20 can be expressed as either one of the selected numbers or the sum of two selected numbers. The goal is to find the minimum number of numbers I need to select. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. I have to choose a subset from the numbers 1 through 10. Let's call this subset S. The condition is that for every number from 1 to 20, it should either be in S or be the sum of two numbers from S. Importantly, the two numbers in the sum can be the same, which means I can use the same number twice if needed.So, my task is to find the smallest possible size of S that satisfies this condition. I guess the first step is to figure out which numbers are essential in S to cover all the numbers up to 20.Let me start by listing out the numbers from 1 to 20 and see how they can be formed:1. 1: This has to be in S because there's no way to get 1 as a sum of two positive integers unless one of them is 1. So, 1 must be in S.2. 2: Similarly, 2 can either be in S or be formed by 1 + 1. But since 1 is already in S, 2 can be formed as 1 + 1. So, 2 doesn't necessarily have to be in S.3. 3: This can be formed as 1 + 2. If 2 is not in S, then we need 3 to be in S. But if 2 is in S, then 3 can be formed. So, depending on whether 2 is in S or not, 3 might or might not need to be in S.4. 4: This can be formed as 2 + 2. If 2 is in S, then 4 can be formed. If 2 is not in S, then 4 would need to be in S.5. 5: This can be formed as 1 + 4 or 2 + 3. If neither 4 nor 3 is in S, then 5 would need to be in S.6. 6: This can be formed as 1 + 5, 2 + 4, or 3 + 3. Depending on which numbers are in S, 6 might not need to be in S.7. 7: This can be formed as 1 + 6, 2 + 5, or 3 + 4. Again, depending on the selected numbers.8. 8: This can be formed as 1 + 7, 2 + 6, 3 + 5, or 4 + 4. If 4 is in S, then 8 can be formed.9. 9: This can be formed as 1 + 8, 2 + 7, 3 + 6, 4 + 5. If 4 or 5 is in S, then 9 can be formed.10. 10: This can be formed as 1 + 9, 2 + 8, 3 + 7, 4 + 6, or 5 + 5. If 5 is in S, then 10 can be formed.11. 11: This can be formed as 1 + 10, 2 + 9, 3 + 8, 4 + 7, or 5 + 6. If 10 is in S, then 11 can be formed.12. 12: This can be formed as 2 + 10, 3 + 9, 4 + 8, 5 + 7, or 6 + 6. If 10 is in S, then 12 can be formed.13. 13: This can be formed as 3 + 10, 4 + 9, 5 + 8, or 6 + 7. If 10 is in S, then 13 can be formed.14. 14: This can be formed as 4 + 10, 5 + 9, 6 + 8, or 7 + 7. If 10 is in S, then 14 can be formed.15. 15: This can be formed as 5 + 10, 6 + 9, 7 + 8. If 10 is in S, then 15 can be formed.16. 16: This can be formed as 6 + 10, 7 + 9, or 8 + 8. If 10 is in S, then 16 can be formed.17. 17: This can be formed as 7 + 10, 8 + 9. If 10 is in S, then 17 can be formed.18. 18: This can be formed as 8 + 10 or 9 + 9. If 10 is in S, then 18 can be formed.19. 19: This can be formed as 9 + 10. If 10 is in S, then 19 can be formed.20. 20: This can be formed as 10 + 10. If 10 is in S, then 20 can be formed.From this analysis, it seems that having 10 in S is crucial because it helps form numbers from 11 to 20. Similarly, having 1 in S is essential because it's needed to form numbers like 2 (1+1), 3 (1+2), etc.But wait, if I include 1 and 10 in S, can I form all numbers up to 20? Let's see:- 1 is in S.- 2 can be formed as 1 + 1.- 3 can be formed as 1 + 2, but 2 isn't in S. So, 3 needs to be in S.- 4 can be formed as 2 + 2, but 2 isn't in S. So, 4 needs to be in S.- 5 can be formed as 1 + 4, but 4 is in S now, so 5 can be formed.- 6 can be formed as 1 + 5, which is 1 + (1 + 4) = 1 + 1 + 4, but that's three numbers. Wait, the problem says the sum of two selected numbers. So, 6 needs to be formed as the sum of two numbers from S. Since 5 is formed as 1 + 4, but 5 itself isn't in S. So, 6 can't be formed unless 5 is in S or 6 is in S.Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to include more numbers in S to cover all possibilities.Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can use the concept of a basis in additive number theory. A basis of order 2 is a set of numbers such that every number can be expressed as the sum of at most two elements from the set. So, I need to find a basis of order 2 for the numbers 1 to 20, using numbers from 1 to 10.I recall that the greedy algorithm can sometimes be used to find such bases. Start with the smallest number, then add numbers that help cover the largest gaps.Starting with 1:- 1 covers 1.- Next, 2 can be formed as 1 + 1, so 2 doesn't need to be in S.- 3 can be formed as 1 + 2, but 2 isn't in S, so 3 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3}.- 4 can be formed as 1 + 3, so 4 is covered.- 5 can be formed as 2 + 3, but 2 isn't in S, so 5 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5}.- 6 can be formed as 1 + 5, so 6 is covered.- 7 can be formed as 2 + 5, but 2 isn't in S, so 7 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7}.- 8 can be formed as 3 + 5, so 8 is covered.- 9 can be formed as 4 + 5, but 4 isn't in S, so 9 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.- 10 can be formed as 5 + 5, so 10 is covered.- 11 can be formed as 1 + 10, but 10 isn't in S, so 11 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}.- 12 can be formed as 3 + 9, so 12 is covered.- 13 can be formed as 5 + 8, but 8 isn't in S, so 13 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}.- 14 can be formed as 7 + 7, so 14 is covered.- 15 can be formed as 5 + 10, but 10 isn't in S, so 15 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}.- 16 can be formed as 7 + 9, so 16 is covered.- 17 can be formed as 8 + 9, but 8 isn't in S, so 17 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17}.- 18 can be formed as 9 + 9, so 18 is covered.- 19 can be formed as 10 + 9, but 10 isn't in S, so 19 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19}.- 20 can be formed as 10 + 10, but 10 isn't in S, so 20 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20}.Wait, but I'm supposed to select numbers only from 1 to 10. So, numbers like 11, 13, etc., are beyond 10 and can't be selected. That's a problem. So, my approach was wrong because I included numbers beyond 10.I need to restrict myself to selecting numbers only from 1 to 10. So, let's try again.Starting with 1:- 1 covers 1.- 2 can be formed as 1 + 1, so 2 is covered.- 3 can be formed as 1 + 2, but 2 isn't in S, so 3 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3}.- 4 can be formed as 1 + 3, so 4 is covered.- 5 can be formed as 2 + 3, but 2 isn't in S, so 5 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5}.- 6 can be formed as 1 + 5, so 6 is covered.- 7 can be formed as 2 + 5, but 2 isn't in S, so 7 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7}.- 8 can be formed as 3 + 5, so 8 is covered.- 9 can be formed as 4 + 5, but 4 isn't in S, so 9 needs to be in S.- Now, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.- 10 can be formed as 5 + 5, so 10 is covered.- 11 can be formed as 1 + 10, but 10 isn't in S, so 11 needs to be in S. But 11 is beyond 10, so I can't include it.- Hmm, this is a problem. I need to cover 11 without including 11 in S. Maybe I need to include 10 in S.Let's try including 10:- S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}.- Now, 11 can be formed as 1 + 10.- 12 can be formed as 2 + 10, but 2 isn't in S. Alternatively, 3 + 9 = 12.- 13 can be formed as 3 + 10.- 14 can be formed as 7 + 7.- 15 can be formed as 5 + 10.- 16 can be formed as 8 + 8, but 8 isn't in S. Alternatively, 7 + 9 = 16.- 17 can be formed as 8 + 9, but 8 isn't in S. Alternatively, 7 + 10 = 17.- 18 can be formed as 9 + 9.- 19 can be formed as 9 + 10.- 20 can be formed as 10 + 10.Wait, does this work? Let's check:- 1: in S.- 2: 1 + 1.- 3: in S.- 4: 1 + 3.- 5: in S.- 6: 1 + 5.- 7: in S.- 8: 3 + 5.- 9: in S.- 10: in S.- 11: 1 + 10.- 12: 3 + 9.- 13: 3 + 10.- 14: 7 + 7.- 15: 5 + 10.- 16: 7 + 9.- 17: 7 + 10.- 18: 9 + 9.- 19: 9 + 10.- 20: 10 + 10.Yes, it seems that with S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}, all numbers from 1 to 20 can be formed. So, that's 6 numbers.But is this the minimal set? Can I remove any number and still cover all numbers?Let's try removing 3:- S = {1, 5, 7, 9, 10}.- 2: 1 + 1.- 3: needs to be formed as 1 + 2, but 2 isn't in S. So, 3 can't be formed. Therefore, 3 is necessary.What about removing 5:- S = {1, 3, 7, 9, 10}.- 4: 1 + 3.- 5: needs to be formed as 2 + 3, but 2 isn't in S. So, 5 can't be formed. Therefore, 5 is necessary.Removing 7:- S = {1, 3, 5, 9, 10}.- 6: 1 + 5.- 7: needs to be formed as 2 + 5, but 2 isn't in S. So, 7 can't be formed. Therefore, 7 is necessary.Removing 9:- S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 10}.- 8: 3 + 5.- 9: needs to be formed as 4 + 5, but 4 isn't in S. So, 9 can't be formed. Therefore, 9 is necessary.Removing 10:- S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.- 10: needs to be formed as 5 + 5.- 11: 1 + 10, but 10 isn't in S. So, 11 can't be formed. Therefore, 10 is necessary.So, it seems that all six numbers are necessary. Therefore, the minimal number of numbers to select is 6."},{"question":"For all positive integers n less than 3001, let [a_n =left{ begin{array}{lr} 15, & text{if } n text{ is divisible by } 15 text{ and } 18; 16, & text{if } n text{ is divisible by } 18 text{ and } 12; 17, & text{if } n text{ is divisible by } 12 text{ and } 15; 0, & text{otherwise}. end{array} right. ]Calculate sum_{n=1}^{3000} a_n.A) 2640B) 2673C) 2705D) 2740","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the sum of a_n from n=1 to 3000. The definition of a_n is given with different cases based on the divisibility of n. Let me try to understand this step by step.First, let me write down the definition again to make sure I have it right:a_n is 15 if n is divisible by both 15 and 18,a_n is 16 if n is divisible by both 18 and 12,a_n is 17 if n is divisible by both 12 and 15,and 0 otherwise.So, for each n from 1 to 3000, I need to check these conditions and assign the corresponding value to a_n, then sum them all up.Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to figure out how many numbers between 1 and 3000 satisfy each of these conditions. Because if I can find how many times each of these cases happen, I can multiply by the respective a_n value and sum them up.Let me break it down:1. **Case 1: a_n = 15** if n is divisible by both 15 and 18.2. **Case 2: a_n = 16** if n is divisible by both 18 and 12.3. **Case 3: a_n = 17** if n is divisible by both 12 and 15.4. **Case 4: a_n = 0** otherwise.So, I need to find the count of numbers divisible by both 15 and 18, then by both 18 and 12, and then by both 12 and 15. But wait, I need to be careful here because some numbers might satisfy more than one condition. For example, a number that is divisible by 15, 18, and 12 would satisfy all three cases. But according to the definition, which case does it fall into? Is it 15, 16, or 17?Looking back at the definition, it seems that the conditions are checked in order. So, if a number satisfies multiple conditions, it will take the value of the first condition it meets. But wait, actually, the way it's written, it's not clear if it's an exclusive OR or inclusive. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.Wait, the definition is written as:a_n = 15 if divisible by 15 and 18,a_n = 16 if divisible by 18 and 12,a_n = 17 if divisible by 12 and 15,0 otherwise.So, it's not explicitly stated whether these are exclusive or not. But in programming terms, if it's a series of if-else statements, it would be exclusive. So, if a number is divisible by all three, it would fall into the first condition (15) and not the others. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Maybe I should assume that each condition is checked independently, and a number can contribute to multiple a_n values? But that can't be, because a_n is defined for each n, so each n can only have one a_n value.Therefore, I think the conditions are exclusive in the sense that if a number satisfies multiple conditions, it will take the value of the first condition it meets. So, for example, if a number is divisible by 15, 18, and 12, it would be assigned 15 because that's the first condition. But I need to confirm this.Wait, actually, the way it's written, it's not an if-else ladder, but rather separate cases. So, it's possible that a number could satisfy multiple cases, but since each case assigns a different value, it's ambiguous. Hmm, this is a problem.Wait, maybe I should think in terms of inclusion-exclusion. Let me see.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the conditions are mutually exclusive. Let me check.If a number is divisible by both 15 and 18, is it possible for it to also be divisible by 12? Well, 15 and 18 have an LCM of 90, and 90 is also divisible by 12? Wait, 90 divided by 12 is 7.5, which is not an integer. So, 90 is not divisible by 12. Therefore, numbers divisible by both 15 and 18 are not divisible by 12, so they don't fall into the other cases.Similarly, numbers divisible by both 18 and 12: their LCM is 36. Is 36 divisible by 15? 36 divided by 15 is 2.4, which is not an integer. So, numbers divisible by both 18 and 12 are not divisible by 15, so they don't fall into the first or third cases.Similarly, numbers divisible by both 12 and 15 have an LCM of 60. Is 60 divisible by 18? 60 divided by 18 is approximately 3.333, which is not an integer. So, numbers divisible by both 12 and 15 are not divisible by 18, so they don't fall into the first or second cases.Therefore, the three cases are mutually exclusive. That is, a number cannot satisfy more than one case. Therefore, I can safely calculate the number of numbers in each case without worrying about overlaps.Okay, that's a relief. So, now I can proceed to calculate the number of multiples for each case.Let me recall that the number of multiples of a number k up to N is given by floor(N/k). So, for each case, I need to find the LCM of the two numbers given, then find how many multiples of that LCM are there up to 3000.So, let's compute the LCMs:1. For the first case, divisible by both 15 and 18: LCM(15, 18). Let's compute that.15 factors into 3 * 5,18 factors into 2 * 3^2.So, LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2 * 3^2 * 5 = 90.So, LCM(15, 18) = 90.2. For the second case, divisible by both 18 and 12: LCM(18, 12).18 factors into 2 * 3^2,12 factors into 2^2 * 3.So, LCM is 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36.So, LCM(18, 12) = 36.3. For the third case, divisible by both 12 and 15: LCM(12, 15).12 factors into 2^2 * 3,15 factors into 3 * 5.So, LCM is 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60.So, LCM(12, 15) = 60.Now, I need to find how many multiples of 90, 36, and 60 are there up to 3000.Let me compute each:1. Multiples of 90 up to 3000:Number of multiples = floor(3000 / 90).Compute 3000 divided by 90:90 * 33 = 2970,90 * 34 = 3060, which is greater than 3000.So, floor(3000 / 90) = 33.So, there are 33 numbers divisible by both 15 and 18.2. Multiples of 36 up to 3000:Number of multiples = floor(3000 / 36).Compute 3000 divided by 36:36 * 83 = 2988,36 * 84 = 3024, which is greater than 3000.So, floor(3000 / 36) = 83.So, there are 83 numbers divisible by both 18 and 12.3. Multiples of 60 up to 3000:Number of multiples = floor(3000 / 60).Compute 3000 divided by 60:60 * 50 = 3000.So, floor(3000 / 60) = 50.So, there are 50 numbers divisible by both 12 and 15.Now, since these cases are mutually exclusive, I can sum the contributions from each case.So, the total sum is:(33 * 15) + (83 * 16) + (50 * 17).Let me compute each term:1. 33 * 15:33 * 10 = 330,33 * 5 = 165,So, 330 + 165 = 495.2. 83 * 16:Let me compute 80 * 16 = 1280,3 * 16 = 48,So, 1280 + 48 = 1328.3. 50 * 17:50 * 10 = 500,50 * 7 = 350,So, 500 + 350 = 850.Now, summing these up:495 + 1328 + 850.Let me add 495 and 1328 first:495 + 1328:495 + 1300 = 1795,1795 + 28 = 1823.Now, add 850:1823 + 850:1823 + 800 = 2623,2623 + 50 = 2673.So, the total sum is 2673.Looking back at the options:A) 2640B) 2673C) 2705D) 2740So, the answer is B) 2673.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.Let me double-check the number of multiples:- 3000 / 90 = 33.333..., so floor is 33. Correct.- 3000 / 36 = 83.333..., floor is 83. Correct.- 3000 / 60 = 50. Correct.Then, the products:33 * 15: 33*10=330, 33*5=165, total 495. Correct.83 * 16: 80*16=1280, 3*16=48, total 1328. Correct.50 * 17: 50*10=500, 50*7=350, total 850. Correct.Sum: 495 + 1328 = 1823, plus 850 is 2673. Correct.Yes, seems solid.

I need to find f(-2023). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I notice that the function has several terms: a cubic term, a linear term, a reciprocal term, and a constant. Maybe I can separate the constant part to make things simpler. Let me define a new function g(x) that includes all the non-constant terms. So, g(x) = a x¬≥ + b x - c/x. Then, f(x) is just g(x) + 2.Now, if I plug in x = 2023 into f(x), I get f(2023) = g(2023) + 2 = 6. That means g(2023) = 6 - 2 = 4.Next, I need to find f(-2023), which would be g(-2023) + 2. To find g(-2023), I should look at the properties of g(x). Let's see, if I replace x with -x in g(x), what happens?g(-x) = a (-x)¬≥ + b (-x) - c/(-x) = -a x¬≥ - b x + c/x.Wait a minute, that's almost like -g(x). Let me check:-g(x) = - (a x¬≥ + b x - c/x) = -a x¬≥ - b x + c/x.Yes! So, g(-x) = -g(x). That means g(x) is an odd function. Odd functions have the property that g(-x) = -g(x) for all x in their domain. Since 2023 is in the domain, this should hold.So, g(-2023) = -g(2023). We already found that g(2023) = 4, so g(-2023) = -4.Now, going back to f(-2023), which is g(-2023) + 2. Plugging in the value we just found:f(-2023) = -4 + 2 = -2.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I separated the constant, defined g(x), used the given f(2023) to find g(2023), recognized that g(x) is odd, used that property to find g(-2023), and then added the constant back. Everything seems to add up.

And m and n are the lengths of two sides of an isosceles triangle ABC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, and the options are 12, 10, 8, or 10 or 8.Alright, let me start by understanding the equation given: |m - 2| + sqrt(n - 4) = 0. Hmm, absolute values and square roots are always non-negative, right? So, both |m - 2| and sqrt(n - 4) must be greater than or equal to zero. Since their sum is zero, each of them must individually be zero. That makes sense because if one was positive, the other would have to be negative to sum to zero, but they can't be negative.So, from |m - 2| = 0, that means m - 2 = 0, so m = 2. And from sqrt(n - 4) = 0, that means n - 4 = 0, so n = 4. Got it. So, m is 2 and n is 4.Now, these are the lengths of two sides of an isosceles triangle. An isosceles triangle has two sides equal. So, either m and n are the two equal sides, or one of them is the base and the other is one of the equal sides.Wait, but m is 2 and n is 4. So, if the triangle is isosceles, either both equal sides are 2, or both equal sides are 4, or one equal side is 2 and the other is 4, but that wouldn't make sense because in an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal.Wait, hold on. If m and n are the lengths of two sides, they could be the two equal sides, or one could be the base and the other an equal side.So, let's consider both possibilities.First, if m = 2 and n = 4 are the two equal sides, that would mean the triangle has two sides of length 2 and one side of length 4. But wait, in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, 2 + 2 must be greater than 4. But 2 + 2 is 4, which is not greater than 4. That violates the triangle inequality theorem. So, that's not possible.Therefore, m and n cannot both be the equal sides. So, the other possibility is that one of them is the base, and the other is one of the equal sides.So, let's consider m = 2 as the base, and n = 4 as one of the equal sides. Then, the triangle would have sides 2, 4, and 4. Let's check the triangle inequality.2 + 4 > 4? Yes, 6 > 4.4 + 4 > 2? Yes, 8 > 2.2 + 4 > 4? Yes, same as the first one.So, that works. So, the sides are 2, 4, and 4, and the perimeter would be 2 + 4 + 4 = 10.Alternatively, if we consider n = 4 as the base and m = 2 as one of the equal sides, then the triangle would have sides 2, 2, and 4. But as I thought earlier, 2 + 2 is not greater than 4, so that doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality. So, that's not possible.Therefore, the only valid configuration is when the base is 2 and the two equal sides are 4 each, giving a perimeter of 10.Wait, but hold on a second. The problem says m and n are exactly the lengths of the two sides. So, does that mean that both m and n are sides, but not necessarily the equal sides? Or does it mean that m and n are the two equal sides?Hmm, the wording says \\"m and n are exactly the lengths of the two sides of an isosceles triangle ABC.\\" So, in an isosceles triangle, there are two equal sides and one different side. So, if m and n are the lengths of the two sides, they could be the two equal sides or one equal side and the base.But in our case, m is 2 and n is 4. So, if they are the two equal sides, as I thought earlier, that's not possible because 2 + 2 is not greater than 4. So, the only other possibility is that one of them is the base and the other is an equal side.So, as I concluded before, the triangle must have sides 2, 4, and 4, giving a perimeter of 10.But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to interpret the problem? Maybe m and n are the lengths of the two equal sides, but that leads to a degenerate triangle, which isn't valid. So, that can't be.Alternatively, could m and n be the lengths of the two sides, but not necessarily the equal sides? So, perhaps m is one equal side, n is the other equal side, but that would mean m = n, but m is 2 and n is 4, which are not equal. So, that can't be.Wait, so maybe the triangle has sides m, n, and another side which is equal to either m or n. So, if m = 2 and n = 4, then the third side could be either 2 or 4.If the third side is 2, then the sides are 2, 2, 4, which doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality. If the third side is 4, then the sides are 2, 4, 4, which does satisfy the triangle inequality.Therefore, the only valid triangle is with sides 2, 4, 4, giving a perimeter of 10.So, the answer should be 10, which is option B.Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A:12, B:10, C:8, D:10 or 8.Hmm, so 10 is an option, but why is 8 also an option? Did I miss something?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\\"Real numbers m and n satisfy |m - 2| + sqrt(n - 4) = 0, and m and n are exactly the lengths of the two sides of an isosceles triangle ABC, then the perimeter of triangle ABC is ( )\\"So, m and n are exactly the lengths of the two sides. So, in an isosceles triangle, there are two sides of equal length and one side of different length. So, m and n could be the two equal sides, or one equal side and the base.But in our case, m = 2 and n = 4. So, if they are the two equal sides, that's not possible because 2 ‚â† 4. So, that can't be.Therefore, one of them must be the base, and the other must be one of the equal sides. So, as I thought earlier, if m = 2 is the base, then the other sides are 4 each, giving a perimeter of 10. If n = 4 is the base, then the other sides are 2 each, but that doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality.Wait, but maybe I'm missing another possibility. Maybe the triangle has sides m, n, and m or n, but not necessarily that m and n are the two equal sides.Wait, but in an isosceles triangle, exactly two sides are equal. So, if m and n are the lengths of the two sides, they could be the two equal sides or one equal side and the base.But since m ‚â† n, they can't be the two equal sides. Therefore, one of them must be the base, and the other must be one of the equal sides.So, if m = 2 is the base, then the other sides are 4 each, as before, giving a perimeter of 10.If n = 4 is the base, then the other sides are 2 each, but 2 + 2 is not greater than 4, so that's invalid.Therefore, the only valid perimeter is 10, which is option B.But wait, why is option D:10 or 8? Maybe I'm missing another case where the perimeter could be 8.Wait, let me think. If m = 2 and n = 4, could the triangle have sides 2, 2, 4? That would give a perimeter of 8, but as I thought earlier, that doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality because 2 + 2 is not greater than 4. So, that's not a valid triangle.Alternatively, could the triangle have sides 4, 4, 2? That's the same as 2, 4, 4, which is valid, giving a perimeter of 10.So, I don't see how the perimeter could be 8. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps the problem is interpreted differently. Maybe m and n are the lengths of the two equal sides, but that would require m = n, which they aren't. So, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe the triangle has sides m, m, and n, or n, n, and m. So, if it's m, m, n, then m = 2, n = 4, so sides 2, 2, 4, which is invalid. If it's n, n, m, then sides 4, 4, 2, which is valid, perimeter 10.So, again, only 10 is possible.Therefore, the answer should be 10, which is option B.But wait, the options include D:10 or 8. Maybe the problem allows for m and n to be the two equal sides, but as I thought earlier, that would require m = n, which they aren't. So, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering m and n as the two sides, but not necessarily the equal sides. So, perhaps the triangle has sides m, n, and another side which is equal to either m or n.So, if m = 2 and n = 4, the third side could be 2 or 4.If the third side is 2, then sides are 2, 2, 4, which is invalid.If the third side is 4, then sides are 2, 4, 4, which is valid, perimeter 10.So, again, only 10 is possible.Therefore, I think the answer is 10, which is option B.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The equation |m - 2| + sqrt(n - 4) = 0 implies m = 2 and n = 4. So, m and n are 2 and 4. Since it's an isosceles triangle, two sides must be equal. So, either two sides are 2, or two sides are 4.If two sides are 2, then the third side is 4, but 2 + 2 is not greater than 4, so that's invalid.If two sides are 4, then the third side is 2, which works, giving a perimeter of 10.Therefore, the perimeter is 10, which is option B.I think that's the correct answer."},{"question":"A can paint a house in 4 hours; B and C together can do it in 3 hours, while A and C together can do it in 2 hours.

To find out how long it will take B to paint the house alone, I'll take the reciprocal of B's rate:Time for B to paint a house = 1 / (1/12) = 12 hours.Therefore, B alone will take 12 hours to paint the house."},{"question":"Given that sin alpha is a root of the equation 5x^{2}-7x-6=0, find:(1) The value of frac {cos (2pi-alpha)cos (pi+alpha)tan ^{2}(2pi-alpha)}{cos ( frac {pi}{2}+alpha)sin (2pi-alpha)cot ^{2}(pi-alpha)}.(2) In triangle ABC, sin A+ cos A= frac { sqrt {2}}{2}, AC=2, AB=3, find the value of tan A.","answer":"Okay, so I've got these two math problems to solve. Let me start with the first one.**Problem (1):** Given that sin Œ± is a root of the equation 5x¬≤ - 7x - 6 = 0, I need to find the value of this trigonometric expression:[frac{cos(2pi - alpha)cos(pi + alpha)tan^2(2pi - alpha)}{cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight)sin(2pi - alpha)cot^2(pi - alpha)}]Alright, first things first. I need to find sin Œ±. The equation given is a quadratic: 5x¬≤ - 7x - 6 = 0. I can solve this using the quadratic formula.The quadratic formula is x = [7 ¬± ‚àö(49 + 120)] / 10, because the discriminant is b¬≤ - 4ac = (-7)¬≤ - 4*5*(-6) = 49 + 120 = 169. So, ‚àö169 = 13.So, x = (7 + 13)/10 = 20/10 = 2, or x = (7 - 13)/10 = (-6)/10 = -3/5.But wait, sin Œ± can't be 2 because the sine function only takes values between -1 and 1. So, sin Œ± must be -3/5.Alright, so sin Œ± = -3/5. Now, I need to find cos Œ±. Since sin¬≤ Œ± + cos¬≤ Œ± = 1, so cos¬≤ Œ± = 1 - sin¬≤ Œ± = 1 - (9/25) = 16/25. Therefore, cos Œ± = ¬±4/5.But I don't know the quadrant where Œ± is. Since sin Œ± is negative, Œ± is either in the third or fourth quadrant. Cos Œ± is positive in the fourth quadrant and negative in the third. Hmm, but without more information, I can't be sure. Maybe I don't need to know the exact value of cos Œ± because the expression might simplify in terms of sin Œ± and tan Œ±.Wait, let me look at the expression again. It's a ratio of products of trigonometric functions. Maybe I can use trigonometric identities to simplify it.Let me recall some identities:- cos(2œÄ - Œ±) = cos Œ± (since cosine is even and periodic with period 2œÄ)- cos(œÄ + Œ±) = -cos Œ± (cosine of œÄ + Œ± is -cos Œ±)- tan(2œÄ - Œ±) = -tan Œ± (tangent is periodic with period œÄ, and tan(2œÄ - Œ±) = tan(-Œ±) = -tan Œ±)- cos(œÄ/2 + Œ±) = -sin Œ± (cosine of œÄ/2 + Œ± is -sin Œ±)- sin(2œÄ - Œ±) = -sin Œ± (sine is odd, so sin(2œÄ - Œ±) = -sin Œ±)- cot(œÄ - Œ±) = -cot Œ± (cotangent is periodic with period œÄ, and cot(œÄ - Œ±) = -cot Œ±)So, let me substitute these into the expression.First, the numerator:cos(2œÄ - Œ±) = cos Œ±cos(œÄ + Œ±) = -cos Œ±tan¬≤(2œÄ - Œ±) = (-tan Œ±)¬≤ = tan¬≤ Œ±So, numerator becomes: cos Œ± * (-cos Œ±) * tan¬≤ Œ± = -cos¬≤ Œ± * tan¬≤ Œ±Denominator:cos(œÄ/2 + Œ±) = -sin Œ±sin(2œÄ - Œ±) = -sin Œ±cot¬≤(œÄ - Œ±) = (-cot Œ±)¬≤ = cot¬≤ Œ±So, denominator becomes: (-sin Œ±) * (-sin Œ±) * cot¬≤ Œ± = sin¬≤ Œ± * cot¬≤ Œ±Therefore, the entire expression is:(-cos¬≤ Œ± * tan¬≤ Œ±) / (sin¬≤ Œ± * cot¬≤ Œ±)Simplify this:First, note that tan Œ± = sin Œ± / cos Œ±, so tan¬≤ Œ± = sin¬≤ Œ± / cos¬≤ Œ±Similarly, cot Œ± = cos Œ± / sin Œ±, so cot¬≤ Œ± = cos¬≤ Œ± / sin¬≤ Œ±Substituting these into the expression:Numerator: -cos¬≤ Œ± * (sin¬≤ Œ± / cos¬≤ Œ±) = -sin¬≤ Œ±Denominator: sin¬≤ Œ± * (cos¬≤ Œ± / sin¬≤ Œ±) = cos¬≤ Œ±So, the expression simplifies to (-sin¬≤ Œ±) / cos¬≤ Œ± = -tan¬≤ Œ±So, now I just need to find tan¬≤ Œ±.Given that sin Œ± = -3/5, and sin¬≤ Œ± + cos¬≤ Œ± = 1, so cos¬≤ Œ± = 1 - 9/25 = 16/25, so cos Œ± = ¬±4/5.But tan Œ± = sin Œ± / cos Œ±. Since sin Œ± is negative, and cos Œ± could be positive or negative, tan Œ± could be negative or positive. But in the expression, we have tan¬≤ Œ±, which is positive regardless.So, tan¬≤ Œ± = (sin¬≤ Œ±) / (cos¬≤ Œ±) = (9/25) / (16/25) = 9/16Therefore, the expression is -tan¬≤ Œ± = -9/16Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the signs.In the numerator, after substitution, it's -cos¬≤ Œ± * tan¬≤ Œ±. Since cos¬≤ Œ± is positive, and tan¬≤ Œ± is positive, the numerator is negative.In the denominator, it's sin¬≤ Œ± * cot¬≤ Œ±. Both sin¬≤ Œ± and cot¬≤ Œ± are positive, so denominator is positive.Therefore, the entire expression is negative, which matches our result of -9/16.So, the value is -9/16.**Problem (2):** In triangle ABC, sin A + cos A = ‚àö2 / 2, AC = 2, AB = 3. Find tan A.Alright, triangle ABC. Let's denote the sides:- AB = 3, which is opposite angle C- AC = 2, which is opposite angle B- BC = ?But wait, actually, in triangle notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, side c opposite angle C.So, if AB = 3, that's side c (opposite angle C), AC = 2, that's side b (opposite angle B), and BC is side a (opposite angle A).But maybe I don't need the sides yet. The given equation is sin A + cos A = ‚àö2 / 2.I need to find tan A.Let me square both sides to use the Pythagorean identity.(sin A + cos A)¬≤ = (‚àö2 / 2)¬≤sin¬≤ A + 2 sin A cos A + cos¬≤ A = (2)/4 = 1/2But sin¬≤ A + cos¬≤ A = 1, so 1 + 2 sin A cos A = 1/2Therefore, 2 sin A cos A = 1/2 - 1 = -1/2So, sin A cos A = -1/4Hmm, interesting. So, sin A cos A is negative. That tells me that either sin A or cos A is negative, but not both.But in a triangle, angles are between 0 and œÄ (0¬∞ and 180¬∞). So, sin A is always positive because angles in a triangle are between 0 and œÄ, and sine is positive in that interval.Therefore, cos A must be negative. So, angle A is in the second quadrant, where cos is negative and sin is positive.So, cos A is negative, sin A is positive.So, sin A + cos A = ‚àö2 / 2, but cos A is negative, so sin A must be greater than ‚àö2 / 2 in magnitude.Wait, but let's see.Let me denote sin A = s, cos A = c.Given that s + c = ‚àö2 / 2, and s¬≤ + c¬≤ = 1.We also found that 2 s c = -1/2, so s c = -1/4.We can set up equations:1. s + c = ‚àö2 / 22. s c = -1/4We can solve for s and c.Let me let s = ‚àö2 / 2 - cSubstitute into equation 2:(‚àö2 / 2 - c) * c = -1/4Multiply out:(‚àö2 / 2) c - c¬≤ = -1/4Bring all terms to one side:- c¬≤ + (‚àö2 / 2) c + 1/4 = 0Multiply both sides by -4 to eliminate fractions:4 c¬≤ - 2‚àö2 c - 1 = 0So, quadratic equation: 4c¬≤ - 2‚àö2 c - 1 = 0Let me solve for c:c = [2‚àö2 ¬± ‚àö( (2‚àö2)^2 - 4*4*(-1) ) ] / (2*4)Compute discriminant:(2‚àö2)^2 = 84*4*(-1) = -16So, discriminant is 8 - (-16) = 8 + 16 = 24Therefore,c = [2‚àö2 ¬± ‚àö24] / 8Simplify ‚àö24 = 2‚àö6So,c = [2‚àö2 ¬± 2‚àö6] / 8 = [‚àö2 ¬± ‚àö6] / 4So, two possibilities:c = (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/4 or c = (‚àö2 - ‚àö6)/4But earlier, we established that cos A is negative because angle A is in the second quadrant.Compute the two options:(‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/4 ‚âà (1.414 + 2.449)/4 ‚âà 3.863/4 ‚âà 0.966, which is positive.(‚àö2 - ‚àö6)/4 ‚âà (1.414 - 2.449)/4 ‚âà (-1.035)/4 ‚âà -0.259, which is negative.Therefore, cos A = (‚àö2 - ‚àö6)/4Therefore, sin A = ‚àö2 / 2 - cos A = ‚àö2 / 2 - (‚àö2 - ‚àö6)/4Compute this:‚àö2 / 2 = 2‚àö2 / 4So, 2‚àö2 / 4 - (‚àö2 - ‚àö6)/4 = (2‚àö2 - ‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/4 = (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/4So, sin A = (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/4Therefore, tan A = sin A / cos A = [ (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/4 ] / [ (‚àö2 - ‚àö6)/4 ] = (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/(‚àö2 - ‚àö6)Multiply numerator and denominator by (‚àö2 + ‚àö6) to rationalize:= [ (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)^2 ] / [ (‚àö2)^2 - (‚àö6)^2 ] = [ (2 + 2‚àö12 + 6) ] / (2 - 6) = (8 + 4‚àö3) / (-4) = - (8 + 4‚àö3)/4 = -2 - ‚àö3So, tan A = -2 - ‚àö3Wait, but in a triangle, angles are between 0 and œÄ, and tan A is negative. That would imply that angle A is in the second quadrant, which makes sense because we already established that cos A is negative and sin A is positive. So, tan A is negative, which is consistent.But just to make sure, let me check if this makes sense with the sides given.Given triangle ABC with sides AB = 3, AC = 2, and angle A.We can use the Law of Cosines to find BC, but maybe it's not necessary here.Alternatively, since we found tan A, we can find the sides in terms of angle A.But maybe it's better to just verify the calculations.Wait, when I squared the equation sin A + cos A = ‚àö2 / 2, I got 1 + 2 sin A cos A = 1/2, so 2 sin A cos A = -1/2, which is correct.Then, solving for sin A and cos A, I got sin A = (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/4 and cos A = (‚àö2 - ‚àö6)/4, which seems correct.Then, tan A = sin A / cos A = [ (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/4 ] / [ (‚àö2 - ‚àö6)/4 ] = (‚àö2 + ‚àö6)/(‚àö2 - ‚àö6). Rationalizing gives -2 - ‚àö3.Yes, that seems correct.So, the value of tan A is -2 - ‚àö3.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{-dfrac{9}{16}}  (2) boxed{-2 - sqrt{3}}"},{"question":"Determine the remainder when 3x^5 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 8 is divided by x^2 + 3x + 2.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the polynomial (3x^5 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 8) is divided by (x^2 + 3x + 2). Hmm, I remember that when dividing polynomials, the remainder has a degree less than the divisor. Since the divisor here is a quadratic (degree 2), the remainder should be a linear polynomial, which means it will look like (ax + b), where (a) and (b) are constants that I need to find.Alright, so let me write that down. If I divide (3x^5 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 8) by (x^2 + 3x + 2), I can express it as:[3x^5 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 8 = (x^2 + 3x + 2) cdot q(x) + ax + b]where (q(x)) is the quotient polynomial, which I don't need to find explicitly.Now, I remember that there's a method where you can substitute the roots of the divisor polynomial into the original polynomial to find the remainder. The roots of (x^2 + 3x + 2) can be found by factoring it. Let me factor it:[x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2)]So, the roots are (x = -1) and (x = -2). That means if I plug (x = -1) and (x = -2) into the original polynomial, I can set up equations to solve for (a) and (b).Let me start with (x = -1). Plugging that into the original polynomial:[3(-1)^5 + 4(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 8]Calculating each term step by step:- (3(-1)^5 = 3(-1) = -3)- (4(-1)^3 = 4(-1) = -4)- (-2(-1)^2 = -2(1) = -2)- (5(-1) = -5)- (-8) remains as it is.Adding them all together:[-3 - 4 - 2 - 5 - 8 = (-3 - 4) + (-2 - 5) + (-8) = (-7) + (-7) + (-8) = -22]On the right side of the equation, when (x = -1), the term ((x + 1)(x + 2)q(x)) becomes zero because (x + 1 = 0). So, we have:[0 + a(-1) + b = -a + b]But we already found that the left side equals (-22), so:[-a + b = -22]Let me write that as equation (1):[-a + b = -22]Now, let's do the same for (x = -2). Plugging (x = -2) into the original polynomial:[3(-2)^5 + 4(-2)^3 - 2(-2)^2 + 5(-2) - 8]Calculating each term:- (3(-2)^5 = 3(-32) = -96)- (4(-2)^3 = 4(-8) = -32)- (-2(-2)^2 = -2(4) = -8)- (5(-2) = -10)- (-8) remains as it is.Adding them all together:[-96 - 32 - 8 - 10 - 8 = (-96 - 32) + (-8 - 10) + (-8) = (-128) + (-18) + (-8) = -154]On the right side, when (x = -2), the term ((x + 1)(x + 2)q(x)) becomes zero because (x + 2 = 0). So, we have:[0 + a(-2) + b = -2a + b]We found that the left side equals (-154), so:[-2a + b = -154]Let me write that as equation (2):[-2a + b = -154]Now, I have a system of two equations:1. (-a + b = -22)2. (-2a + b = -154)I need to solve for (a) and (b). Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate (b):[(-2a + b) - (-a + b) = -154 - (-22)]Simplifying the left side:[-2a + b + a - b = (-2a + a) + (b - b) = -a + 0 = -a]Simplifying the right side:[-154 + 22 = -132]So, we have:[-a = -132]Multiplying both sides by (-1):[a = 132]Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake.Wait, no, actually, when I subtracted equation (1) from equation (2), I should have:[(-2a + b) - (-a + b) = -2a + b + a - b = (-2a + a) + (b - b) = -a + 0 = -a]And on the right side:[-154 - (-22) = -154 + 22 = -132]So, (-a = -132) implies (a = 132). Hmm, but that seems quite large. Let me verify by plugging back into equation (1):[-132 + b = -22 implies b = -22 + 132 = 110]Wait, that would mean the remainder is (132x + 110), but when I plug (x = -1) into this, I get (-132 + 110 = -22), which matches. Similarly, plugging (x = -2) gives (-264 + 110 = -154), which also matches. So, maybe it's correct after all.But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in my earlier step when I set up the equations. Let me double-check the substitution for (x = -2):[3(-2)^5 = 3(-32) = -96][4(-2)^3 = 4(-8) = -32][-2(-2)^2 = -2(4) = -8][5(-2) = -10][-8]Adding them: (-96 -32 = -128), (-128 -8 = -136), (-136 -10 = -146), (-146 -8 = -154). That's correct.So, the calculations seem correct, leading to (a = 132) and (b = 110). Therefore, the remainder is (132x + 110).Wait, but in the initial problem, the user provided a solution where the remainder was (66x - 22). That's different from what I got. Did I make a mistake somewhere?Let me go back and check my steps again.Starting with the original polynomial:[3x^5 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 8]Divided by (x^2 + 3x + 2), which factors to ((x + 1)(x + 2)).When (x = -1):[3(-1)^5 + 4(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 8]Calculates to:[-3 -4 -2 -5 -8 = -22]Which gives equation (1): (-a + b = -22).When (x = -2):[3(-2)^5 + 4(-2)^3 - 2(-2)^2 + 5(-2) - 8]Calculates to:[-96 -32 -8 -10 -8 = -154]Which gives equation (2): (-2a + b = -154).Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):[(-2a + b) - (-a + b) = -154 - (-22)]Simplifies to:[-a = -132 implies a = 132]Then, from equation (1):[-132 + b = -22 implies b = 110]So, the remainder is (132x + 110).But the user's solution had (66x -22). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check if I substituted correctly.Wait, in the user's solution, they had:For (x = -1):[-3 -4 -2 -5 -8 = -22]Which is correct.For (x = -2):They calculated:[-96 -32 -8 -10 -8 = -154]Which is also correct.Then, they set up:[-2a -22 = -154]Wait, that's different from what I did. Let me see.In the user's solution, they had:[-2a -22 = -154]Which implies:[-2a = -132 implies a = 66]Then, (b = -22).Wait, so how did they get that? Let me see.In their setup, when they plugged in (x = -2), they had:[-2a + b = -154]But in their solution, they wrote:[-2a -22 = -154]Which suggests that they substituted (b = -22) from the first equation into the second equation. Let me see:From equation (1): (-a + b = -22), so (b = a -22).Then, substituting into equation (2):[-2a + (a -22) = -154]Simplifies to:[-2a + a -22 = -154 implies -a -22 = -154]Then:[-a = -154 +22 = -132 implies a = 132]Wait, that's the same result as before. So, perhaps the user made a mistake in their solution.Wait, no, looking back at the user's solution, they wrote:[-2a -22 = -154]Which implies they substituted (b = -22) directly into equation (2), but from equation (1), (b = a -22), not (b = -22).So, the user incorrectly substituted (b = -22) into equation (2), leading to an incorrect value for (a). Therefore, their solution is wrong, and my initial calculation is correct, leading to (a = 132) and (b = 110).But wait, that seems inconsistent because when I plug (x = -1) into (132x + 110), I get (-132 + 110 = -22), which matches. Similarly, plugging (x = -2) gives (-264 + 110 = -154), which also matches. So, my solution is correct.Therefore, the remainder should be (132x + 110), not (66x -22) as the user suggested.Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me double-check the calculations for (x = -2):[3(-2)^5 = 3(-32) = -96][4(-2)^3 = 4(-8) = -32][-2(-2)^2 = -2(4) = -8][5(-2) = -10][-8]Adding them: (-96 -32 = -128), (-128 -8 = -136), (-136 -10 = -146), (-146 -8 = -154). Correct.So, the calculations are correct, leading to (a = 132) and (b = 110). Therefore, the remainder is (132x + 110).But wait, the user's solution had (66x -22). Maybe they made a mistake in their calculations. Let me check their steps.In their solution, they wrote:For (x = -1):[-3 -4 -2 -5 -8 = -22]Which is correct.For (x = -2):They calculated:[-96 -32 -8 -10 -8 = -154]Which is correct.Then, they set up:[-2a -22 = -154]Which implies they substituted (b = -22) into equation (2), but from equation (1), (b = a -22), not (b = -22). So, their substitution was incorrect, leading to (a = 66) instead of (a = 132).Therefore, the correct remainder is (132x + 110), not (66x -22).Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try polynomial long division to confirm.Starting with dividing (3x^5 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x -8) by (x^2 + 3x + 2).First, arrange the dividend in descending order, making sure all degrees are present:[3x^5 + 0x^4 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x -8]Divide by (x^2 + 3x + 2).The leading term of the dividend is (3x^5), and the leading term of the divisor is (x^2). So, the first term of the quotient is (3x^5 / x^2 = 3x^3).Multiply the entire divisor by (3x^3):[3x^3 cdot (x^2 + 3x + 2) = 3x^5 + 9x^4 + 6x^3]Subtract this from the dividend:[(3x^5 + 0x^4 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x -8) - (3x^5 + 9x^4 + 6x^3) = -9x^4 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x -8]Now, the new dividend is (-9x^4 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x -8).The leading term is (-9x^4), divide by (x^2) to get (-9x^2). Multiply the divisor by (-9x^2):[-9x^2 cdot (x^2 + 3x + 2) = -9x^4 -27x^3 -18x^2]Subtract this from the current dividend:[(-9x^4 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x -8) - (-9x^4 -27x^3 -18x^2) = 25x^3 +16x^2 +5x -8]Now, the new dividend is (25x^3 +16x^2 +5x -8).The leading term is (25x^3), divide by (x^2) to get (25x). Multiply the divisor by (25x):[25x cdot (x^2 + 3x + 2) =25x^3 +75x^2 +50x]Subtract this from the current dividend:[(25x^3 +16x^2 +5x -8) - (25x^3 +75x^2 +50x) = -59x^2 -45x -8]Now, the new dividend is (-59x^2 -45x -8).The leading term is (-59x^2), divide by (x^2) to get (-59). Multiply the divisor by (-59):[-59 cdot (x^2 + 3x + 2) = -59x^2 -177x -118]Subtract this from the current dividend:[(-59x^2 -45x -8) - (-59x^2 -177x -118) = 132x +110]So, the remainder is (132x + 110), which matches my earlier result.Therefore, the correct remainder is (132x + 110), not (66x -22) as previously thought.I think the user made a mistake in their substitution step when solving for (a) and (b). They incorrectly substituted (b = -22) into the second equation instead of using the relationship from the first equation. Therefore, their solution was incorrect, and the correct remainder is (132x + 110)."},{"question":"Let f(x) = x^2 + bx + c (b, c in mathbb{R}), and let A = {x | x = f(x), x in mathbb{R}}, B = {x | x = f[f(x)], x in mathbb{R}}. If A is a set with only one element, then the relationship between A and B is ( )A: A = BB: A subsetneq BC: B subsetneq AD: A cap B = varnothing","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about functions and sets. Let me try to understand it step by step. We have a function f(x) defined as f(x) = x¬≤ + b x + c, where b and c are real numbers. Then, we're given two sets, A and B. Set A is the set of all real numbers x such that x equals f(x). Set B is the set of all real numbers x such that x equals f(f(x)). The question tells us that set A has only one element, and we need to figure out the relationship between sets A and B. The options are whether A equals B, A is a proper subset of B, B is a proper subset of A, or if their intersection is empty.Alright, so first, let's unpack what set A is. Since A is the set of solutions to x = f(x), that means we're looking for fixed points of the function f. Similarly, set B is the set of solutions to x = f(f(x)), which are the fixed points of the function f composed with itself.Given that A has only one element, that suggests that the equation x = f(x) has exactly one real solution. Let me write that equation out:x = x¬≤ + b x + cIf I rearrange this, it becomes:x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + c = 0This is a quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution, its discriminant must be zero. The discriminant D of a quadratic equation ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0 is D = b¬≤ - 4ac. In our case, the quadratic equation is x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + c = 0. So, the discriminant D is:D = (b - 1)¬≤ - 4 * 1 * c = 0So, (b - 1)¬≤ - 4c = 0. That's a key equation we'll probably use later.Now, moving on to set B. Set B is the set of solutions to x = f(f(x)). Let's write that out:x = f(f(x)) = f(x¬≤ + b x + c)Let's compute f(f(x)):f(f(x)) = f(x¬≤ + b x + c) = (x¬≤ + b x + c)¬≤ + b(x¬≤ + b x + c) + cSo, expanding that:First, compute (x¬≤ + b x + c)¬≤:= x‚Å¥ + 2b x¬≥ + (b¬≤ + 2c) x¬≤ + 2b c x + c¬≤Then, compute b(x¬≤ + b x + c):= b x¬≤ + b¬≤ x + b cAdding these together and then adding c:f(f(x)) = x‚Å¥ + 2b x¬≥ + (b¬≤ + 2c) x¬≤ + 2b c x + c¬≤ + b x¬≤ + b¬≤ x + b c + cCombine like terms:- x‚Å¥ term: x‚Å¥- x¬≥ term: 2b x¬≥- x¬≤ terms: (b¬≤ + 2c + b) x¬≤- x terms: (2b c + b¬≤) x- constants: c¬≤ + b c + cSo, f(f(x)) simplifies to:x‚Å¥ + 2b x¬≥ + (b¬≤ + 2c + b) x¬≤ + (2b c + b¬≤) x + (c¬≤ + b c + c)Therefore, the equation x = f(f(x)) becomes:x = x‚Å¥ + 2b x¬≥ + (b¬≤ + 2c + b) x¬≤ + (2b c + b¬≤) x + (c¬≤ + b c + c)Let's bring all terms to one side:x‚Å¥ + 2b x¬≥ + (b¬≤ + 2c + b) x¬≤ + (2b c + b¬≤ - 1) x + (c¬≤ + b c + c) = 0So, we have a quartic equation (degree 4) for set B.Now, since set A is the solution set for x = f(x), which is a quadratic equation, and we know it has exactly one solution, let's denote that solution as Œ±. So, Œ± is the only real number such that Œ± = f(Œ±).Given that, let's see if Œ± is also a solution to x = f(f(x)). Plugging Œ± into f(f(x)):f(f(Œ±)) = f(Œ±) = Œ±So, Œ± satisfies x = f(f(x)), which means Œ± is in set B. Therefore, A is a subset of B.But the question is whether A equals B or if B is a larger set. Since B is the solution set of a quartic equation, which can have up to four real roots, while A has only one, it's possible that B has more elements than A.However, we need to check if all solutions of B must necessarily be in A or not. Let's think about this.Suppose x is a solution to x = f(f(x)). Then, x = f(f(x)). If x is also a solution to x = f(x), then it's in A. But could there be solutions where x ‚â† f(x) but x = f(f(x))? In other words, could there be points where x is a fixed point of f composed with itself, but not a fixed point of f? Yes, in general, fixed points of f are also fixed points of f composed with itself, but the converse isn't necessarily true. So, it's possible that B has more elements than A.But in our case, since A has only one element, let's see if B can have more elements.Wait, but let's think about the structure of f. Since f is a quadratic function, f(f(x)) is a quartic function. The equation x = f(f(x)) is a quartic equation, which can have up to four real roots. However, depending on the specific coefficients, it might have fewer.But given that A has only one element, which is a fixed point of f, and since fixed points of f are also fixed points of f(f(x)), then A is a subset of B. So, A is contained within B.But could B have more elements? That is, could there be solutions to x = f(f(x)) that are not solutions to x = f(x)?Yes, in general, but in our case, since f is a quadratic function, and A has only one element, perhaps the quartic equation for B can be factored in terms of the quadratic equation for A.Let me try to factor the quartic equation.Given that x = f(f(x)) is equivalent to f(f(x)) - x = 0. Let's denote this as:f(f(x)) - x = 0But since f(x) = x¬≤ + b x + c, then f(f(x)) is as we computed earlier.But perhaps we can factor this quartic equation in terms of the quadratic equation x = f(x). Since x = f(x) is a quadratic, and if x is a solution to x = f(x), then it's also a solution to x = f(f(x)). So, the quadratic equation x = f(x) is a factor of the quartic equation x = f(f(x)).Therefore, the quartic equation can be written as (quadratic)(quadratic) = 0.So, let's try to factor f(f(x)) - x.Given that f(f(x)) - x = 0, and since f(x) - x = 0 is a factor, we can perform polynomial division or factorization.Let me denote g(x) = f(x) - x = x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + c.Then, f(f(x)) - x = f(f(x)) - x = f(f(x)) - f(x) + f(x) - x = [f(f(x)) - f(x)] + [f(x) - x]But f(f(x)) - f(x) = f(f(x)) - f(x) = (f(x))¬≤ + b f(x) + c - f(x) = (f(x))¬≤ + (b - 1) f(x) + cNotice that this is similar to g(f(x)) = (f(x))¬≤ + (b - 1) f(x) + cBut g(x) = x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + c, so g(f(x)) = (f(x))¬≤ + (b - 1) f(x) + cTherefore, f(f(x)) - x = g(f(x)) + g(x)Wait, let me check:f(f(x)) - x = [f(f(x)) - f(x)] + [f(x) - x] = g(f(x)) + g(x)Yes, that's correct.So, f(f(x)) - x = g(f(x)) + g(x)But g(x) = f(x) - x, so:f(f(x)) - x = g(f(x)) + g(x) = [f(f(x)) - f(x)] + [f(x) - x]But we can also note that g(f(x)) = (f(x))¬≤ + (b - 1)f(x) + cBut since g(x) = x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + c, then g(f(x)) is just g evaluated at f(x).Therefore, f(f(x)) - x = g(f(x)) + g(x)But since g(x) = 0 when x is a solution to x = f(x), which is our set A.So, if x is a solution to g(x) = 0, then f(f(x)) - x = g(f(x)) + 0 = g(f(x))But since x is a fixed point, f(x) = x, so g(f(x)) = g(x) = 0. Therefore, f(f(x)) - x = 0, which is consistent.But for other solutions, where g(x) ‚â† 0, we have f(f(x)) - x = g(f(x)) + g(x) = 0So, if x is not a fixed point, then g(x) ‚â† 0, but g(f(x)) must be equal to -g(x).Hmm, that's interesting. So, for solutions not in A, we have g(f(x)) = -g(x)So, if x is a solution to x = f(f(x)) but not a solution to x = f(x), then g(f(x)) = -g(x)So, let's write that:g(f(x)) = -g(x)But g(x) = x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + cSo, g(f(x)) = (f(x))¬≤ + (b - 1)f(x) + cBut f(x) = x¬≤ + b x + c, so:g(f(x)) = (x¬≤ + b x + c)¬≤ + (b - 1)(x¬≤ + b x + c) + cWhich is exactly what we had before.But setting g(f(x)) = -g(x):(x¬≤ + b x + c)¬≤ + (b - 1)(x¬≤ + b x + c) + c = - (x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + c)So, moving everything to one side:(x¬≤ + b x + c)¬≤ + (b - 1)(x¬≤ + b x + c) + c + x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + c = 0Simplify:(x¬≤ + b x + c)¬≤ + (b - 1)(x¬≤ + b x + c) + x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + 2c = 0This seems complicated, but perhaps we can factor it.Alternatively, since we know that g(x) = x¬≤ + (b - 1)x + c, and we have g(f(x)) = -g(x), maybe we can write this as:g(f(x)) + g(x) = 0Which is exactly the equation we had earlier for f(f(x)) - x = 0.So, in other words, the quartic equation f(f(x)) - x = 0 can be factored as g(f(x)) + g(x) = 0, which is g(f(x)) = -g(x)But since g(x) is a quadratic, and g(f(x)) is a quartic, perhaps we can factor the quartic equation as (g(x))(something) = 0.Wait, let me think. If g(x) is a factor of f(f(x)) - x, then f(f(x)) - x = g(x) * h(x), where h(x) is another quadratic.But we have f(f(x)) - x = g(f(x)) + g(x) = 0So, perhaps g(f(x)) + g(x) = g(x) * (something) = 0But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach.Since we know that A has only one element, which is a double root of the quadratic equation g(x) = 0. So, the quadratic has a discriminant of zero, as we found earlier: (b - 1)¬≤ - 4c = 0.So, c = (b - 1)¬≤ / 4Therefore, we can write c in terms of b.So, let's substitute c = (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 into our quartic equation.So, f(f(x)) - x = 0 becomes:x‚Å¥ + 2b x¬≥ + (b¬≤ + 2c + b) x¬≤ + (2b c + b¬≤ - 1) x + (c¬≤ + b c + c) = 0Substituting c = (b - 1)¬≤ / 4:First, compute each coefficient:1. Coefficient of x¬≤: b¬≤ + 2c + b = b¬≤ + 2*( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 ) + b = b¬≤ + ( (b - 1)¬≤ ) / 2 + b2. Coefficient of x: 2b c + b¬≤ - 1 = 2b*( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 ) + b¬≤ - 1 = (b*(b - 1)¬≤ ) / 2 + b¬≤ - 13. Constant term: c¬≤ + b c + c = ( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 )¬≤ + b*( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 ) + ( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 )This is getting complicated, but let's try to compute each term step by step.First, let's compute c = (b - 1)¬≤ / 4Compute each coefficient:1. x‚Å¥ term: 12. x¬≥ term: 2b3. x¬≤ term: b¬≤ + 2c + b = b¬≤ + 2*( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 ) + b = b¬≤ + ( (b - 1)¬≤ ) / 2 + bLet me compute (b - 1)¬≤ = b¬≤ - 2b + 1So, x¬≤ coefficient becomes:b¬≤ + (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/2 + b = b¬≤ + (b¬≤/2 - b + 0.5) + b = (b¬≤ + b¬≤/2) + (-b + b) + 0.5 = (3b¬≤/2) + 0 + 0.5 = (3b¬≤)/2 + 1/24. x term: 2b c + b¬≤ - 1 = 2b*( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 ) + b¬≤ - 1 = (b*(b - 1)¬≤ ) / 2 + b¬≤ - 1Compute (b - 1)¬≤ = b¬≤ - 2b + 1So, x term becomes:(b*(b¬≤ - 2b + 1))/2 + b¬≤ - 1 = (b¬≥ - 2b¬≤ + b)/2 + b¬≤ - 1= (b¬≥/2 - b¬≤ + b/2) + b¬≤ - 1= b¬≥/2 + (-b¬≤ + b¬≤) + (b/2 - 1)= b¬≥/2 + 0 + (b/2 - 1)= (b¬≥)/2 + (b)/2 - 15. Constant term: c¬≤ + b c + cCompute each part:c¬≤ = ( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 )¬≤ = (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)¬≤ / 16b c = b*( (b - 1)¬≤ / 4 ) = b*(b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4c = (b - 1)¬≤ / 4So, constant term:= (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)¬≤ / 16 + b*(b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 + (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4Let me factor out (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 from the last two terms:= (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)¬≤ / 16 + (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 * (b + 1)Wait, no:Wait, the last two terms are:b*(b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 + (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 = (b + 1)*(b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4So, constant term becomes:= (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)¬≤ / 16 + (b + 1)*(b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4Factor out (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4:= (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 * [ (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 + (b + 1) ]Compute inside the brackets:= (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 + (b + 1) = (b¬≤ - 2b + 1 + 4b + 4)/4 = (b¬≤ + 2b + 5)/4Therefore, constant term:= (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)/4 * (b¬≤ + 2b + 5)/4 = (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)(b¬≤ + 2b + 5)/16So, putting it all together, the quartic equation becomes:x‚Å¥ + 2b x¬≥ + ( (3b¬≤)/2 + 1/2 ) x¬≤ + ( (b¬≥)/2 + (b)/2 - 1 ) x + ( (b¬≤ - 2b + 1)(b¬≤ + 2b + 5)/16 ) = 0This is quite complicated. Maybe instead of trying to factor this quartic, we can think about the roots.We know that x = Œ± is a root of both g(x) = 0 and f(f(x)) - x = 0, where Œ± is the only solution to x = f(x). Since g(x) has a double root at Œ±, because the discriminant is zero, then f(f(x)) - x = 0 will have Œ± as a root, but how many times?Since g(x) is a factor of f(f(x)) - x, and g(x) has a double root at Œ±, then f(f(x)) - x will have Œ± as a root with multiplicity at least 2.But since f(f(x)) - x is a quartic, it can have up to four roots. However, given that f is a quadratic function, and A has only one element, perhaps B also has only one element, which is Œ±.Wait, but that contradicts the earlier thought that B could have more elements. Let me think again.If f(x) has a double root at Œ±, then f(x) - x = (x - Œ±)^2. So, f(x) = x + (x - Œ±)^2.Then, f(f(x)) = f(x + (x - Œ±)^2) = [x + (x - Œ±)^2] + [x + (x - Œ±)^2 - Œ±]^2This might be a way to express f(f(x)) in terms of Œ±.But perhaps it's better to consider the behavior of f(x). Since f(x) is a quadratic function opening upwards (since the coefficient of x¬≤ is positive), and it has a double root at Œ±, meaning it touches the line y = x at Œ± and doesn't cross it. So, the graph of f(x) is tangent to the line y = x at Œ±.Now, let's consider the graph of f(f(x)). Since f(x) is a quadratic, f(f(x)) is a quartic. The fixed points of f(f(x)) are the solutions to x = f(f(x)).We know that Œ± is a fixed point of both f(x) and f(f(x)). But could there be other fixed points?Since f(x) is tangent to y = x at Œ±, let's analyze the behavior around Œ±.For x near Œ±, f(x) is approximately equal to x + (x - Œ±)^2, as we have f(x) = x + (x - Œ±)^2.Then, f(f(x)) ‚âà f(x + (x - Œ±)^2) = [x + (x - Œ±)^2] + [x + (x - Œ±)^2 - Œ±]^2Simplify:= x + (x - Œ±)^2 + [ (x - Œ±) + (x - Œ±)^2 ]^2Let me set t = x - Œ±, so x = Œ± + t.Then, f(f(x)) ‚âà Œ± + t + t¬≤ + [ t + t¬≤ ]¬≤= Œ± + t + t¬≤ + t¬≤ + 2t¬≥ + t‚Å¥= Œ± + t + 2t¬≤ + 2t¬≥ + t‚Å¥So, f(f(x)) ‚âà Œ± + t + 2t¬≤ + 2t¬≥ + t‚Å¥But x = Œ± + t, so x ‚âà Œ± + t.Therefore, f(f(x)) - x ‚âà (Œ± + t + 2t¬≤ + 2t¬≥ + t‚Å¥) - (Œ± + t) = 2t¬≤ + 2t¬≥ + t‚Å¥So, near x = Œ±, f(f(x)) - x ‚âà 2t¬≤ + 2t¬≥ + t‚Å¥, which is positive for t ‚â† 0.This suggests that near Œ±, f(f(x)) is above the line y = x, except at x = Œ± where they touch.Therefore, the graph of f(f(x)) intersects the line y = x only at x = Œ±, and nowhere else near Œ±.But what about far from Œ±? Since f(x) is a quadratic opening upwards, f(f(x)) will also open upwards, but it's a quartic. The leading term is x‚Å¥, which dominates for large |x|.So, as x approaches ¬±‚àû, f(f(x)) behaves like x‚Å¥, which goes to +‚àû. The line y = x is negligible compared to x‚Å¥ for large |x|.Therefore, the graph of f(f(x)) will intersect the line y = x only at x = Œ±, because near Œ±, it's tangent, and far from Œ±, it's above the line y = x.Wait, but that would mean that B has only one element, which is Œ±, same as A. Therefore, A = B.But earlier, I thought that B could have more elements. Maybe in this specific case, since A has only one element, B also has only one element, which is the same as A.Let me check with an example. Suppose f(x) = x¬≤ - 2x + 1. Then, f(x) = (x - 1)^2. So, solving x = f(x):x = (x - 1)^2x¬≤ - 2x + 1 = xx¬≤ - 3x + 1 = 0Wait, but this quadratic has discriminant 9 - 4 = 5, which is positive, so two real roots. But in our case, A has only one element, so the discriminant must be zero.Wait, let me choose f(x) such that x = f(x) has exactly one solution.Let me set f(x) = x¬≤ - 2x + 1, which is (x - 1)^2. Then, solving x = f(x):x = (x - 1)^2x¬≤ - 2x + 1 = xx¬≤ - 3x + 1 = 0Wait, discriminant is 9 - 4 = 5, which is positive. So, two solutions. Not what we want.Wait, perhaps f(x) = x¬≤ - 2x + 1 is not the right example. Let me choose f(x) such that x = f(x) has exactly one solution.So, let me set f(x) = x¬≤ + bx + c, and set discriminant zero:(b - 1)^2 - 4c = 0 => c = (b - 1)^2 / 4Let me choose b = 1, then c = 0.So, f(x) = x¬≤ + x + 0 = x¬≤ + xThen, solving x = f(x):x = x¬≤ + x => x¬≤ = 0 => x = 0. So, A = {0}Now, compute B: solutions to x = f(f(x)).Compute f(f(x)):f(f(x)) = f(x¬≤ + x) = (x¬≤ + x)^2 + (x¬≤ + x) = x‚Å¥ + 2x¬≥ + x¬≤ + x¬≤ + x = x‚Å¥ + 2x¬≥ + 2x¬≤ + xSo, equation x = f(f(x)) becomes:x = x‚Å¥ + 2x¬≥ + 2x¬≤ + xSubtract x:0 = x‚Å¥ + 2x¬≥ + 2x¬≤Factor:x¬≤(x¬≤ + 2x + 2) = 0So, solutions are x = 0 (double root) and roots of x¬≤ + 2x + 2 = 0, which are complex.Therefore, the only real solution is x = 0, which is in A. So, B = {0} = A.Therefore, in this case, A = B.Another example: Let me choose b = 3, then c = (3 - 1)^2 / 4 = (2)^2 / 4 = 1So, f(x) = x¬≤ + 3x + 1Solve x = f(x):x = x¬≤ + 3x + 1 => x¬≤ + 2x + 1 = 0 => (x + 1)^2 = 0 => x = -1So, A = {-1}Now, compute B: x = f(f(x))Compute f(f(x)):f(f(x)) = f(x¬≤ + 3x + 1) = (x¬≤ + 3x + 1)^2 + 3(x¬≤ + 3x + 1) + 1Expand:= x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + (9 + 2)x¬≤ + (6 + 3)x + 1 + 3x¬≤ + 9x + 3 + 1Wait, let's compute step by step.First, (x¬≤ + 3x + 1)^2:= x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + (9 + 2)x¬≤ + 6x + 1Wait, no:Wait, (x¬≤ + 3x + 1)^2 = x‚Å¥ + 2*3x¬≥ + (3x)^2 + 2*x¬≤*1 + 2*3x*1 + 1¬≤Wait, no, that's incorrect. The correct expansion is:(x¬≤ + 3x + 1)(x¬≤ + 3x + 1) = x‚Å¥ + 3x¬≥ + x¬≤ + 3x¬≥ + 9x¬≤ + 3x + x¬≤ + 3x + 1Combine like terms:x‚Å¥ + (3x¬≥ + 3x¬≥) + (x¬≤ + 9x¬≤ + x¬≤) + (3x + 3x) + 1= x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + 11x¬≤ + 6x + 1Then, compute 3(x¬≤ + 3x + 1):= 3x¬≤ + 9x + 3Add them together and add 1:f(f(x)) = x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + 11x¬≤ + 6x + 1 + 3x¬≤ + 9x + 3 + 1Combine like terms:x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + (11x¬≤ + 3x¬≤) + (6x + 9x) + (1 + 3 + 1)= x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + 14x¬≤ + 15x + 5Therefore, equation x = f(f(x)) becomes:x = x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + 14x¬≤ + 15x + 5Bring all terms to one side:x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + 14x¬≤ + 14x + 5 = 0Now, let's factor this quartic equation. Since we know that x = -1 is a solution (because A = {-1}), let's check if x = -1 is a root:(-1)^4 + 6*(-1)^3 + 14*(-1)^2 + 14*(-1) + 5 = 1 - 6 + 14 - 14 + 5 = 0Yes, x = -1 is a root. Let's perform polynomial division to factor out (x + 1).Divide x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + 14x¬≤ + 14x + 5 by (x + 1):Using synthetic division:-1 | 1  6  14  14  5          -1  -5  -9  -5      1  5   9   5   0So, the quartic factors as (x + 1)(x¬≥ + 5x¬≤ + 9x + 5)Now, let's factor the cubic x¬≥ + 5x¬≤ + 9x + 5.Try x = -1 again:(-1)^3 + 5*(-1)^2 + 9*(-1) + 5 = -1 + 5 - 9 + 5 = 0So, x = -1 is a root again. Perform synthetic division:-1 | 1  5  9  5          -1  -4  -5      1  4  5  0So, the cubic factors as (x + 1)(x¬≤ + 4x + 5)Therefore, the quartic factors as (x + 1)^2 (x¬≤ + 4x + 5)Thus, the equation x‚Å¥ + 6x¬≥ + 14x¬≤ + 14x + 5 = 0 factors as (x + 1)^2 (x¬≤ + 4x + 5) = 0So, the real solutions are x = -1 (double root), and the quadratic x¬≤ + 4x + 5 = 0 has discriminant 16 - 20 = -4, which is negative, so no real roots.Therefore, the only real solution is x = -1, which is in A. So, B = {-1} = A.Therefore, in this case as well, A = B.From these examples, it seems that when A has only one element, B also has only that element, so A = B.But let me think again. Suppose f(x) is such that f(f(x)) = x has only one real solution, which is the same as x = f(x). Then, A = B.But could there be a case where f(f(x)) = x has more real solutions, even though x = f(x) has only one?Wait, in the examples above, when A had one element, B also had only that element. So, perhaps in general, when A has only one element, B cannot have more elements because the quartic equation f(f(x)) - x = 0 would have only that one real root, with multiplicity, but no other real roots.Alternatively, maybe the quartic equation could have more real roots, but in our case, due to the specific condition that A has only one element, the quartic equation cannot have more real roots.Wait, let me think about the graph of f(f(x)).Since f(x) is a quadratic function with a double fixed point at Œ±, the graph of f(x) touches the line y = x at Œ± and lies above it elsewhere (since it's a parabola opening upwards).Therefore, f(f(x)) is a composition of two functions, both of which are quadratics. The composition f(f(x)) will be a quartic function.Since f(x) is above y = x except at x = Œ±, then f(f(x)) will be f evaluated at points that are above y = x except at x = Œ±.But since f(x) is above y = x for x ‚â† Œ±, then f(f(x)) = f(some value ‚â• x). But since f is increasing for x ‚â• vertex, and decreasing for x ‚â§ vertex.Wait, the vertex of f(x) is at x = -b/(2*1) = -b/2.But since f(x) is a quadratic opening upwards, it has a minimum at x = -b/2.So, depending on where Œ± is relative to the vertex, the behavior of f(f(x)) could vary.But in our case, since f(x) has a double root at Œ±, which is also the vertex, because for a quadratic with a double root, the vertex is at that root.Wait, yes! For a quadratic function f(x) = x¬≤ + bx + c, the vertex is at x = -b/2. If the quadratic has a double root at Œ±, then Œ± = -b/2, and the discriminant is zero, so c = (b - 1)^2 / 4.Therefore, the vertex of f(x) is at x = Œ±, and since it's a double root, the graph touches y = x at the vertex.Therefore, f(x) is tangent to y = x at x = Œ±, and lies above y = x elsewhere.Therefore, f(f(x)) is f evaluated at points that are either equal to or greater than x, except at x = Œ±.But since f(x) is above y = x except at x = Œ±, then f(f(x)) is f evaluated at points that are ‚â• x (except at x = Œ±, where it's equal).But f is increasing for x ‚â• Œ± and decreasing for x ‚â§ Œ±.Wait, since the vertex is at x = Œ±, and the parabola opens upwards, f(x) is decreasing for x < Œ± and increasing for x > Œ±.Therefore, for x < Œ±, f(x) is decreasing, so f(f(x)) would be f evaluated at a value greater than or equal to x (since f(x) ‚â• x for all x).But since f(x) is decreasing for x < Œ±, f(f(x)) would be increasing for x < Œ±.Similarly, for x > Œ±, f(x) is increasing, so f(f(x)) is increasing as well.But regardless, the key point is that f(f(x)) is above y = x except at x = Œ±, because f(x) is above y = x except at x = Œ±.Therefore, the equation x = f(f(x)) can only be satisfied at x = Œ±, because elsewhere, f(f(x)) > x.Therefore, B = {Œ±} = A.Thus, in this case, A = B.So, the correct answer is A: A = B."},{"question":"The derivative of the function y=x^3-frac{1}{x} is ( )A: y'=3x^2-frac{1}{x^2}B: y'=3x^2-frac{1}{x}C: y'=3x^2+frac{1}{x^2}D: y'=3x^2+frac{1}{x}","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the derivative of the function y = x¬≥ - 1/x. Hmm, derivatives. I remember from my math class that to find the derivative, I need to apply some rules. Let me think... There's the power rule, right? That's for differentiating terms like x‚Åø. The power rule says that the derivative of x‚Åø is n*x^(n-1). Okay, so I can use that for the x¬≥ term.First, let's break down the function into two separate parts: y = x¬≥ and y = -1/x. I'll find the derivative of each part separately and then combine them.Starting with y = x¬≥. Applying the power rule here, the derivative should be 3*x¬≤. That seems straightforward.Now, the second part is y = -1/x. Hmm, this is a bit trickier. I remember that 1/x can be rewritten as x^(-1). So, y = -x^(-1). Now, applying the power rule to this term, the derivative would be -1 * (-1)*x^(-2), right? Because the exponent is -1, so n = -1, and the derivative would be n*x^(n-1), which is -1*x^(-2). Wait, but there's also a negative sign in front of the x^(-1), so that would make the derivative positive. Let me double-check that.So, if y = -x^(-1), then dy/dx = -1 * (-1)*x^(-2) = 1*x^(-2) = 1/x¬≤. Okay, that makes sense. So the derivative of -1/x is 1/x¬≤.Now, putting it all together, the derivative of y = x¬≥ - 1/x is the sum of the derivatives of each term. So, that would be 3x¬≤ + 1/x¬≤.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the signs. The original function is y = x¬≥ - 1/x. So, when I take the derivative of x¬≥, it's positive 3x¬≤, and the derivative of -1/x is positive 1/x¬≤ because of the negative sign in front. So, adding those together, it's 3x¬≤ + 1/x¬≤.Looking at the options provided:A: y' = 3x¬≤ - 1/x¬≤B: y' = 3x¬≤ - 1/xC: y' = 3x¬≤ + 1/x¬≤D: y' = 3x¬≤ + 1/xSo, based on my calculations, the correct derivative is 3x¬≤ + 1/x¬≤, which is option C. Let me just go through it one more time to be sure.Derivative of x¬≥ is 3x¬≤. Derivative of -1/x is 1/x¬≤. Adding them together gives 3x¬≤ + 1/x¬≤. Yep, that's definitely option C. I think I got it right."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a common difference d neq 0, and a_1, a_3, a_{13} form a geometric sequence. If a_1 = 1, and S_n is the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}, then the minimum value of frac {2S_{n}+16}{a_{n}+3} is („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: 4  B: 3  C: 2 sqrt {3} - 2  D: 2","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to understand it step by step. First, the problem says that we have an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a common difference d, which is not zero. That means each term increases by d from the previous term. It also mentions that a_1, a_3, and a_{13} form a geometric sequence. Hmm, okay, so in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Given that a_1 is 1, I need to find the common difference d. Once I have d, I can find the general term a_n and the sum S_n of the first n terms. Then, I have to find the minimum value of the expression (2S_n + 16)/(a_n + 3). The options are given, so maybe I can check them once I have the expression.Let me write down what I know:1. It's an arithmetic sequence, so a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Since a_1 is 1, a_n = 1 + (n-1)d.2. The terms a_1, a_3, a_{13} form a geometric sequence. So, the ratio between consecutive terms should be the same. That means (a_3)/(a_1) = (a_{13})/(a_3). So, let me write that equation:(a_3)^2 = a_1 * a_{13}Since a_1 is 1, this simplifies to:(a_3)^2 = a_{13}Now, let's compute a_3 and a_{13} using the arithmetic sequence formula.a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 1 + 2da_{13} = a_1 + 12d = 1 + 12dSo, substituting these into the equation:(1 + 2d)^2 = 1 + 12dLet me expand the left side:1 + 4d + 4d^2 = 1 + 12dNow, subtract 1 from both sides:4d + 4d^2 = 12dSubtract 12d from both sides:4d^2 - 8d = 0Factor out 4d:4d(d - 2) = 0So, d = 0 or d = 2. But the problem says d ‚â† 0, so d = 2.Okay, so the common difference is 2. Now, let me find the general term a_n.a_n = 1 + (n - 1)*2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1So, a_n = 2n - 1.Next, I need to find S_n, the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence. The formula for the sum is:S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)We know a_1 is 1 and a_n is 2n - 1, so:S_n = n/2 * (1 + 2n - 1) = n/2 * (2n) = n^2So, S_n = n^2.Now, the expression we need to minimize is:(2S_n + 16)/(a_n + 3)Substituting S_n and a_n:(2n^2 + 16)/(2n - 1 + 3) = (2n^2 + 16)/(2n + 2)Simplify numerator and denominator:Factor numerator: 2(n^2 + 8)Denominator: 2(n + 1)So, the expression becomes:[2(n^2 + 8)] / [2(n + 1)] = (n^2 + 8)/(n + 1)So, now we have to minimize (n^2 + 8)/(n + 1). Let me denote this as f(n):f(n) = (n^2 + 8)/(n + 1)I need to find the minimum value of f(n) where n is a positive integer (since it's the number of terms in the sequence). One way to approach this is to perform polynomial division or simplify the expression. Let me try dividing n^2 + 8 by n + 1.Divide n^2 by n: that gives n. Multiply (n + 1) by n: n^2 + n. Subtract that from n^2 + 8:(n^2 + 8) - (n^2 + n) = -n + 8So, now we have:f(n) = n + (-n + 8)/(n + 1)Hmm, that might not be very helpful. Maybe I can write it as:f(n) = n - 1 + 9/(n + 1)Wait, let me check that. Let me perform the division step by step.Divide n^2 + 8 by n + 1.First term: n^2 / n = nMultiply (n + 1) by n: n^2 + nSubtract: (n^2 + 8) - (n^2 + n) = -n + 8Now, divide -n by n: -1Multiply (n + 1) by -1: -n -1Subtract: (-n + 8) - (-n -1) = 0 + 9So, the division gives:n - 1 + 9/(n + 1)So, f(n) = n - 1 + 9/(n + 1)That's better. So, f(n) = (n + 1) + 9/(n + 1) - 2Wait, let me see:n - 1 + 9/(n + 1) = (n + 1) - 2 + 9/(n + 1)Yes, that's correct.So, f(n) = (n + 1) + 9/(n + 1) - 2Now, let me denote t = n + 1, so t is an integer greater than or equal to 2 (since n is at least 1). Then, f(n) becomes:f(t) = t + 9/t - 2So, now I need to minimize f(t) = t + 9/t - 2 for t ‚â• 2, t integer.This looks like a function where I can apply the AM-GM inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers a and b, (a + b)/2 ‚â• sqrt(ab), with equality when a = b.So, for t and 9/t, both positive, we have:(t + 9/t)/2 ‚â• sqrt(t * 9/t) = sqrt(9) = 3Multiply both sides by 2:t + 9/t ‚â• 6So, t + 9/t - 2 ‚â• 6 - 2 = 4Therefore, f(t) ‚â• 4Equality holds when t = 9/t, which implies t^2 = 9, so t = 3 (since t is positive). So, the minimum value of f(t) is 4, achieved when t = 3. Since t = n + 1, t = 3 implies n + 1 = 3, so n = 2.Let me verify this by plugging n = 2 into the original expression:First, compute S_2: S_2 = 2^2 = 4a_2 = 2*2 - 1 = 3So, (2S_2 + 16)/(a_2 + 3) = (8 + 16)/(3 + 3) = 24/6 = 4Yes, that works. Let me check n = 1 just to be sure:S_1 = 1^2 = 1a_1 = 1Expression: (2*1 + 16)/(1 + 3) = (2 + 16)/4 = 18/4 = 4.5, which is more than 4.n = 3:S_3 = 9a_3 = 5Expression: (18 + 16)/(5 + 3) = 34/8 = 4.25, which is still more than 4.n = 4:S_4 = 16a_4 = 7Expression: (32 + 16)/(7 + 3) = 48/10 = 4.8, which is more.So, indeed, the minimum is 4 at n = 2.Wait, but let me check if t can be non-integer? Because in the problem, n is an integer, so t is also an integer. So, the minimum occurs at t = 3, which is integer, so that's fine.Alternatively, if we treated t as a real variable, the minimum would still be at t = 3, so it's consistent.Therefore, the minimum value is 4, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Divide 23 cards, each labeled with numbers 1 to 23, into three piles. It is known that the average numbers of the three piles are 13, 4, and 17, respectively. What is the minimum number of cards in the pile with an average number of 13?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to divide 23 cards, each labeled from 1 to 23, into three piles. The average numbers of these three piles are given as 13, 4, and 17 respectively. I need to find the minimum number of cards in the pile that has an average of 13. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let's understand what it means for a pile to have a certain average. If a pile has an average of 13, that means the sum of the numbers on the cards in that pile divided by the number of cards is 13. Similarly, for the other piles with averages 4 and 17, their sums divided by their respective card counts will be 4 and 17.Let me denote the number of cards in the three piles as ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) respectively. So, the pile with average 13 has ( a ) cards, the one with average 4 has ( b ) cards, and the one with average 17 has ( c ) cards. Since there are 23 cards in total, I can write the equation:[a + b + c = 23]That's straightforward.Next, I need to consider the total sum of all the cards. The cards are labeled from 1 to 23, so the total sum is the sum of the first 23 natural numbers. I remember the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). So, plugging in ( n = 23 ):[text{Total sum} = frac{23 times 24}{2} = 276]So, the sum of all the numbers on the cards is 276.Now, since each pile has a certain average, the sum of the numbers in each pile can be expressed in terms of their averages and the number of cards. So, for the pile with average 13, the sum is ( 13a ). Similarly, for the other piles, the sums are ( 4b ) and ( 17c ). Therefore, the total sum can also be expressed as:[13a + 4b + 17c = 276]So now I have two equations:1. ( a + b + c = 23 )2. ( 13a + 4b + 17c = 276 )I need to find the minimum value of ( a ). To do that, I can try to express one variable in terms of the others using the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.Let me solve the first equation for ( c ):[c = 23 - a - b]Now, substitute this into the second equation:[13a + 4b + 17(23 - a - b) = 276]Let me expand this:[13a + 4b + 17 times 23 - 17a - 17b = 276]Calculating ( 17 times 23 ):[17 times 20 = 340 quad text{and} quad 17 times 3 = 51 quad text{so total is} quad 340 + 51 = 391]So, substituting back:[13a + 4b + 391 - 17a - 17b = 276]Combine like terms:- For ( a ): ( 13a - 17a = -4a )- For ( b ): ( 4b - 17b = -13b )So, the equation becomes:[-4a - 13b + 391 = 276]Subtract 391 from both sides:[-4a - 13b = 276 - 391][-4a - 13b = -115]Multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficients positive:[4a + 13b = 115]Now, I have the equation ( 4a + 13b = 115 ). I need to find integer solutions for ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a ) is minimized. Since ( a ) and ( b ) represent the number of cards, they must be positive integers.Let me try to express ( a ) in terms of ( b ):[4a = 115 - 13b][a = frac{115 - 13b}{4}]Since ( a ) must be an integer, ( 115 - 13b ) must be divisible by 4. Let's find values of ( b ) such that ( 115 - 13b ) is divisible by 4.First, let's note that ( b ) must be a positive integer, and since ( a ) and ( c ) also need to be positive, ( b ) can't be too large. Let's find the possible values of ( b ).Let's compute ( 115 ) modulo 4:[115 div 4 = 28 text{ remainder } 3]So, ( 115 equiv 3 mod 4 ).Similarly, ( 13b mod 4 ):Since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so ( 13 equiv 1 mod 4 ). Therefore, ( 13b equiv b mod 4 ).So, ( 115 - 13b equiv 3 - b mod 4 ). For ( 115 - 13b ) to be divisible by 4, ( 3 - b equiv 0 mod 4 ), which implies:[b equiv 3 mod 4]So, ( b ) must be congruent to 3 modulo 4. That is, ( b = 4k + 3 ) for some integer ( k geq 0 ).Now, let's find the possible values of ( b ). Since ( a ) and ( c ) must be positive, ( b ) can't be too large.From the equation ( a = frac{115 - 13b}{4} ), ( a ) must be positive:[frac{115 - 13b}{4} > 0][115 - 13b > 0][13b < 115][b < frac{115}{13} approx 8.846]So, ( b ) must be less than approximately 8.846, meaning ( b leq 8 ).Since ( b ) must be congruent to 3 modulo 4 and less than or equal to 8, the possible values for ( b ) are 3, 7.Let's test these values:1. **Case 1: ( b = 3 )**   [   a = frac{115 - 13 times 3}{4} = frac{115 - 39}{4} = frac{76}{4} = 19   ]   So, ( a = 19 ), ( b = 3 ). Then, ( c = 23 - 19 - 3 = 1 ).   Let's check if this works:   - Sum of pile with average 13: ( 13 times 19 = 247 )   - Sum of pile with average 4: ( 4 times 3 = 12 )   - Sum of pile with average 17: ( 17 times 1 = 17 )   - Total sum: ( 247 + 12 + 17 = 276 ), which matches.   So, this is a valid solution. However, we are looking for the minimum ( a ), so let's check the next possible value.2. **Case 2: ( b = 7 )**   [   a = frac{115 - 13 times 7}{4} = frac{115 - 91}{4} = frac{24}{4} = 6   ]   So, ( a = 6 ), ( b = 7 ). Then, ( c = 23 - 6 - 7 = 10 ).   Let's check this:   - Sum of pile with average 13: ( 13 times 6 = 78 )   - Sum of pile with average 4: ( 4 times 7 = 28 )   - Sum of pile with average 17: ( 17 times 10 = 170 )   - Total sum: ( 78 + 28 + 170 = 276 ), which also matches.   This is another valid solution, and ( a = 6 ) is smaller than the previous ( a = 19 ). So, this is a better solution.Are there any more possible values for ( b )? The next value would be ( b = 11 ), but ( 11 > 8.846 ), so it's not allowed. Therefore, the possible values for ( b ) are only 3 and 7, and the corresponding ( a ) values are 19 and 6.Since we're looking for the minimum ( a ), the smallest value is 6. Therefore, the minimum number of cards in the pile with an average of 13 is 6.But wait, let me double-check if there are any other possible values for ( b ) that I might have missed. Since ( b ) must be congruent to 3 modulo 4 and less than or equal to 8, the only possibilities are 3 and 7. So, I think I've covered all cases.Just to be thorough, let's consider if ( b = 3 ) and ( a = 19 ) is the only other solution, but since we're looking for the minimum ( a ), 6 is indeed smaller.Therefore, the minimum number of cards in the pile with an average of 13 is 6.**Final Answer**The minimum number of cards in the pile with an average of 13 is boxed{6}."},{"question":"In the reaction K_2Cr_2O_7+HCl rightarrow KCl+CrCl_3+Cl_2‚Üë+H_2O:(1) The oxidizing agent is ____, the element being oxidized is ____, and the oxidation product is ____.(2) In the hydrochloric acid involved in the reaction, the mass ratio of the oxidized HCl to the unoxidized HCl is ____.(3) If the reaction produces 0.1mol of Cl_2, then the number of electrons transferred is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I'm looking at this chemical reaction: K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá + HCl ‚Üí KCl + CrCl‚ÇÉ + Cl‚ÇÇ‚Üë + H‚ÇÇO. I need to figure out three things about it. First, I need to identify the oxidizing agent, the element being oxidized, and the oxidation product. Second, I need to find the mass ratio of the oxidized HCl to the unoxidized HCl in the reaction. Lastly, if the reaction produces 0.1 mol of Cl‚ÇÇ, I need to determine the number of electrons transferred.Alright, starting with the first part: identifying the oxidizing agent, the element being oxidized, and the oxidation product. I remember that in redox reactions, the oxidizing agent is the substance that gets reduced, meaning it gains electrons. The element being oxidized is the one that loses electrons, and the oxidation product is the result of that oxidation.Looking at the reaction, I see that K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá is reacting with HCl to produce KCl, CrCl‚ÇÉ, Cl‚ÇÇ gas, and water. I think I need to assign oxidation states to each element to see where the changes are happening.For K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá: Potassium (K) is usually +1, oxygen (O) is -2. So, for K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá, the formula is K‚ÇÇ(Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá). The total charge is neutral, so 2*(+1) + 2*(Cr) + 7*(-2) = 0. That simplifies to 2 + 2Cr -14 = 0, so 2Cr = 12, which means Cr is +6.In HCl, hydrogen is +1 and chlorine is -1. In KCl, potassium is +1 and chlorine is -1. In CrCl‚ÇÉ, chromium is +3 because Cl is -1 and there are three Cl atoms. In Cl‚ÇÇ, chlorine is 0 since it's in its elemental form. In H‚ÇÇO, hydrogen is +1 and oxygen is -2.So, looking at the changes:- Chromium in K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá goes from +6 to +3 in CrCl‚ÇÉ. That means it's gaining electrons, so it's being reduced. Therefore, K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá is the oxidizing agent.- Chlorine in HCl goes from -1 to 0 in Cl‚ÇÇ. That means it's losing electrons, so it's being oxidized. Therefore, chlorine is the element being oxidized, and Cl‚ÇÇ is the oxidation product.Okay, that seems to make sense. So, for part (1), the oxidizing agent is K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá, the element being oxidized is chlorine in HCl, and the oxidation product is Cl‚ÇÇ.Moving on to part (2): the mass ratio of the oxidized HCl to the unoxidized HCl. I need to figure out how much HCl is oxidized and how much remains unoxidized in the reaction.First, I should probably balance the equation to see the stoichiometry. Let's try balancing K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá + HCl ‚Üí KCl + CrCl‚ÇÉ + Cl‚ÇÇ + H‚ÇÇO.Starting with K: There are 2 K on the left and 1 K on the right in KCl. To balance K, I'll put a 2 in front of KCl: K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá + HCl ‚Üí 2 KCl + CrCl‚ÇÉ + Cl‚ÇÇ + H‚ÇÇO.Next, Cr: There are 2 Cr in K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá and 1 Cr in CrCl‚ÇÉ. To balance Cr, I'll put a 2 in front of CrCl‚ÇÉ: K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá + HCl ‚Üí 2 KCl + 2 CrCl‚ÇÉ + Cl‚ÇÇ + H‚ÇÇO.Now, O: There are 7 O in K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá and 1 O in H‚ÇÇO. To balance O, I'll put a 7 in front of H‚ÇÇO: K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá + HCl ‚Üí 2 KCl + 2 CrCl‚ÇÉ + Cl‚ÇÇ + 7 H‚ÇÇO.Next, H: There are H in HCl and H‚ÇÇO. On the left, HCl has H, and on the right, H‚ÇÇO has 2 H per molecule. Since there are 7 H‚ÇÇO, that's 14 H. So, I'll put a 14 in front of HCl: K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá + 14 HCl ‚Üí 2 KCl + 2 CrCl‚ÇÉ + Cl‚ÇÇ + 7 H‚ÇÇO.Now, Cl: On the left, 14 Cl from HCl. On the right, 2 Cl in KCl, 6 Cl in 2 CrCl‚ÇÉ (since each CrCl‚ÇÉ has 3 Cl), and 2 Cl in Cl‚ÇÇ. So, total Cl on the right is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 Cl. But we have 14 Cl on the left. That means we need to balance Cl.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recount:Left side: 14 Cl from HCl.Right side: 2 KCl ‚Üí 2 Cl, 2 CrCl‚ÇÉ ‚Üí 6 Cl, Cl‚ÇÇ ‚Üí 2 Cl. Total Cl on the right: 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 Cl.But on the left, we have 14 Cl. So, we need to adjust the coefficients. Maybe I need to multiply the entire equation by something to balance Cl.Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of half-reactions to balance the redox reaction.Let's try that. First, separate the reaction into oxidation and reduction half-reactions.Reduction half-reaction: Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª ‚Üí Cr¬≥‚Å∫.Oxidation half-reaction: Cl‚Åª ‚Üí Cl‚ÇÇ.Balancing the reduction half-reaction:Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª ‚Üí Cr¬≥‚Å∫.First, balance Cr: 2 Cr on both sides.Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª ‚Üí 2 Cr¬≥‚Å∫.Next, balance O by adding H‚ÇÇO: Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª ‚Üí 2 Cr¬≥‚Å∫ + 7 H‚ÇÇO.Then, balance H by adding H‚Å∫: Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª + 14 H‚Å∫ ‚Üí 2 Cr¬≥‚Å∫ + 7 H‚ÇÇO.Finally, balance charge by adding electrons. On the left, we have Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª and 14 H‚Å∫, which is a total charge of (-2) + 14(+1) = +12. On the right, 2 Cr¬≥‚Å∫ is +6, and 7 H‚ÇÇO is neutral. So, to balance charge, we need to add 6 electrons to the left side:Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª + 14 H‚Å∫ + 6 e‚Åª ‚Üí 2 Cr¬≥‚Å∫ + 7 H‚ÇÇO.Now, the oxidation half-reaction: Cl‚Åª ‚Üí Cl‚ÇÇ.First, balance Cl: 2 Cl‚Åª ‚Üí Cl‚ÇÇ.Then, balance charge by adding electrons. On the left, 2 Cl‚Åª have a charge of -2. On the right, Cl‚ÇÇ is neutral. So, we need to lose 2 electrons:2 Cl‚Åª ‚Üí Cl‚ÇÇ + 2 e‚Åª.Now, to balance the electrons, we need to make the number of electrons in both half-reactions equal. The reduction half-reaction has 6 e‚Åª, and the oxidation half-reaction has 2 e‚Åª. So, we'll multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 3 to get 6 e‚Åª:6 Cl‚Åª ‚Üí 3 Cl‚ÇÇ + 6 e‚Åª.Now, add the two half-reactions together:Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª + 14 H‚Å∫ + 6 e‚Åª + 6 Cl‚Åª ‚Üí 2 Cr¬≥‚Å∫ + 7 H‚ÇÇO + 3 Cl‚ÇÇ + 6 e‚Åª.The electrons cancel out:Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª + 14 H‚Å∫ + 6 Cl‚Åª ‚Üí 2 Cr¬≥‚Å∫ + 7 H‚ÇÇO + 3 Cl‚ÇÇ.Now, let's convert this back to the molecular equation. Remember that K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá dissociates into 2 K‚Å∫ and Cr‚ÇÇO‚Çá¬≤‚Åª. So, the full equation would be:K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá + 14 HCl ‚Üí 2 KCl + 2 CrCl‚ÇÉ + 3 Cl‚ÇÇ + 7 H‚ÇÇO.Yes, that matches what I had earlier. So, in the balanced equation, 14 HCl molecules are involved. Out of these, some are oxidized to Cl‚ÇÇ, and the rest remain as Cl‚Åª in KCl and CrCl‚ÇÉ.From the balanced equation, 3 Cl‚ÇÇ molecules are produced. Each Cl‚ÇÇ molecule comes from 2 Cl‚Åª ions. So, 3 Cl‚ÇÇ molecules require 6 Cl‚Åª ions to be oxidized. Therefore, 6 HCl molecules are oxidized.The remaining HCl molecules are 14 - 6 = 8 HCl molecules, which are not oxidized. They remain as Cl‚Åª in KCl and CrCl‚ÇÉ.So, the mass ratio of oxidized HCl to unoxidized HCl is 6:8, which simplifies to 3:4.Okay, that seems to make sense.Now, for part (3): If the reaction produces 0.1 mol of Cl‚ÇÇ, then the number of electrons transferred is... Hmm, I need to figure out the number of electrons involved in the oxidation of Cl‚Åª to Cl‚ÇÇ.From the oxidation half-reaction, 2 Cl‚Åª ‚Üí Cl‚ÇÇ + 2 e‚Åª. So, for every mole of Cl‚ÇÇ produced, 2 moles of electrons are transferred.Therefore, if 0.1 mol of Cl‚ÇÇ is produced, the number of electrons transferred is 0.1 mol * 2 = 0.2 mol of electrons.But the question asks for the number of electrons, not moles. So, I need to convert moles to actual number of electrons using Avogadro's number.Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022 √ó 10¬≤¬≥ particles/mol. So, 0.2 mol of electrons is 0.2 * 6.022 √ó 10¬≤¬≥ = 1.2044 √ó 10¬≤¬≥ electrons.Therefore, the number of electrons transferred is approximately 1.204 √ó 10¬≤¬≥.Let me double-check that. For every mole of Cl‚ÇÇ, 2 moles of electrons are transferred. So, 0.1 mol Cl‚ÇÇ * 2 mol e‚Åª/mol Cl‚ÇÇ = 0.2 mol e‚Åª. Then, 0.2 mol e‚Åª * 6.022 √ó 10¬≤¬≥ e‚Åª/mol = 1.2044 √ó 10¬≤¬≥ e‚Åª. Yes, that seems correct.So, summarizing:1. Oxidizing agent: K‚ÇÇCr‚ÇÇO‚Çá; element being oxidized: Cl in HCl; oxidation product: Cl‚ÇÇ.2. Mass ratio of oxidized HCl to unoxidized HCl: 3:4.3. Number of electrons transferred when 0.1 mol Cl‚ÇÇ is produced: 1.204 √ó 10¬≤¬≥.I think that's it. I hope I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations or reasoning."},{"question":"if 0.75 : x : : 5 : 7 , then x is equal to :","answer":"First, I recognize that the problem involves a proportion, which can be written as 0.75/x = 5/7.To solve for x, I will cross-multiply, resulting in 0.75 * 7 = 5 * x.Calculating the left side gives me 5.25 = 5x.Finally, I divide both sides by 5 to find x, which equals 1.05."},{"question":"If the line ax + 2y + 6 = 0 is parallel to but does not coincide with the line x + (a-1)y + (a^2 - 1) = 0, then a equals","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of 'a' such that the line ax + 2y + 6 = 0 is parallel to, but does not coincide with, the line x + (a - 1)y + (a¬≤ - 1) = 0. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that for two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. So, I need to find the slopes of both lines and set them equal to each other. But to find the slope, it might be easier if I rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.Starting with the first equation: ax + 2y + 6 = 0. I'll solve for y.Subtract ax and 6 from both sides: 2y = -ax - 6.Now, divide every term by 2 to solve for y: y = (-a/2)x - 3.So, the slope (m1) of the first line is -a/2.Now, moving on to the second equation: x + (a - 1)y + (a¬≤ - 1) = 0. I'll solve for y as well.First, subtract x and (a¬≤ - 1) from both sides: (a - 1)y = -x - (a¬≤ - 1).Now, divide every term by (a - 1) to solve for y: y = (-1/(a - 1))x - (a¬≤ - 1)/(a - 1).So, the slope (m2) of the second line is -1/(a - 1).Since the lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Therefore, I can set m1 equal to m2:-a/2 = -1/(a - 1).Okay, now I need to solve this equation for 'a'. Let's get rid of the negative signs first by multiplying both sides by -1:a/2 = 1/(a - 1).Now, cross-multiplying to solve for 'a':a(a - 1) = 2.Expanding the left side:a¬≤ - a = 2.Subtract 2 from both sides to set the equation to zero:a¬≤ - a - 2 = 0.Now, I have a quadratic equation: a¬≤ - a - 2 = 0. I can try to factor this. Let's see, I need two numbers that multiply to -2 and add up to -1. Hmm, 2 and -1? Yes, because 2 * (-1) = -2 and 2 + (-1) = 1. Wait, but I have -a, so maybe it's -2 and 1? Let me check:(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0.Yes, that works because (a - 2)(a + 1) = a¬≤ + a - 2a - 2 = a¬≤ - a - 2, which matches.So, the solutions are a = 2 and a = -1.But wait, the problem says the lines are parallel but do not coincide. So, I need to make sure that when a = 2, the lines don't coincide. Let me check that.First, if a = 2, let's plug it back into both equations.First equation: 2x + 2y + 6 = 0. Simplify by dividing by 2: x + y + 3 = 0, so y = -x - 3.Second equation: x + (2 - 1)y + (2¬≤ - 1) = x + y + (4 - 1) = x + y + 3 = 0, which simplifies to y = -x - 3.Oh no, so when a = 2, both equations become the same line. That means they coincide, which is not allowed. So, a = 2 is not a valid solution.Therefore, the only valid solution is a = -1.Let me double-check with a = -1.First equation: (-1)x + 2y + 6 = 0. Simplify: -x + 2y + 6 = 0. Solving for y: 2y = x - 6, so y = (1/2)x - 3.Second equation: x + (-1 - 1)y + ((-1)¬≤ - 1) = x + (-2)y + (1 - 1) = x - 2y + 0 = 0. Solving for y: -2y = -x, so y = (1/2)x.Wait, so the first line is y = (1/2)x - 3 and the second line is y = (1/2)x. They have the same slope, which is 1/2, so they are parallel. But their y-intercepts are different (-3 vs. 0), so they don't coincide. Perfect, that's what we want.So, a = -1 is the correct answer.I think that covers everything. I found the slopes, set them equal, solved for 'a', checked both solutions, and made sure that a = 2 causes the lines to coincide, which isn't allowed, so a = -1 is the only valid solution.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{-1}."},{"question":"Given alpha and beta are two different planes, the following four conditions are given:  ‚ë† There exists a line a, where a perp alpha, a perp beta;  ‚ë° There exists a plane gamma, where gamma perp alpha, gamma perp beta;  ‚ë¢ There exist two parallel lines a and b, where a subset alpha, b subset beta, a parallel beta, b parallel alpha;  ‚ë£ There exist two skew lines a and b, where a subset alpha, b subset beta, a parallel beta, b parallel alpha.  Among these, the sufficient conditions for plane alpha parallel plane beta are. Fill in all the applicable sequence numbers.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about two different planes, Œ± and Œ≤, and I need to figure out which of the four given conditions are sufficient to conclude that Œ± is parallel to Œ≤. Let me go through each condition one by one and see if I can understand why they might or might not be sufficient.Starting with condition ‚ë†: There exists a line a such that a is perpendicular to both Œ± and Œ≤. Hmm, okay. If I remember correctly, if two planes are both perpendicular to the same line, that means they must be parallel to each other. Because if they weren't parallel, they would intersect, and their normals (which are in the direction of line a) would not be the same. So, if there's a single line that's perpendicular to both planes, that should mean the planes are parallel. So, condition ‚ë† seems like a sufficient condition.Moving on to condition ‚ë°: There exists a plane Œ≥ that is perpendicular to both Œ± and Œ≤. Hmm, this one is a bit trickier. If Œ≥ is perpendicular to both Œ± and Œ≤, does that necessarily mean Œ± and Œ≤ are parallel? Let me visualize this. Imagine Œ≥ is like a wall, and both Œ± and Œ≤ are floors that are perpendicular to this wall. But in reality, two floors can be perpendicular to the same wall but still intersect each other along a line that's parallel to the wall. So, Œ± and Œ≤ could intersect, meaning they aren't necessarily parallel. Therefore, condition ‚ë° doesn't guarantee that Œ± and Œ≤ are parallel. So, condition ‚ë° is not sufficient.Now, condition ‚ë¢: There exist two parallel lines a and b, where a is in Œ±, b is in Œ≤, a is parallel to Œ≤, and b is parallel to Œ±. Okay, so lines a and b are both parallel to each other and lie in their respective planes. Also, each line is parallel to the other plane. Does this mean the planes are parallel? Let me think. If Œ± and Œ≤ intersect, their line of intersection would have to be parallel to both a and b. So, even if the planes intersect, you can still have such lines a and b. For example, imagine two planes that intersect along a line l. If I take a line a in Œ± that's parallel to l and a line b in Œ≤ that's also parallel to l, then a and b would be parallel, and each would be parallel to the other plane. So, condition ‚ë¢ doesn't necessarily mean the planes are parallel. Hence, condition ‚ë¢ isn't sufficient.Finally, condition ‚ë£: There exist two skew lines a and b, where a is in Œ±, b is in Œ≤, a is parallel to Œ≤, and b is parallel to Œ±. Skew lines are lines that don't intersect and aren't parallel. So, if a is in Œ± and parallel to Œ≤, and b is in Œ≤ and parallel to Œ±, and they're skew, does that mean Œ± and Œ≤ are parallel? Let me try to reason this out. If Œ± and Œ≤ were not parallel, they would intersect along some line l. Now, if a is in Œ± and parallel to Œ≤, then a must be parallel to l. Similarly, b is in Œ≤ and parallel to Œ±, so b must also be parallel to l. But if both a and b are parallel to l, then a and b should be parallel to each other, right? But the condition says they are skew, which means they aren't parallel. This is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that Œ± and Œ≤ intersect must be wrong. So, Œ± and Œ≤ must be parallel. Therefore, condition ‚ë£ is sufficient.So, after going through each condition, it seems that conditions ‚ë† and ‚ë£ are sufficient to conclude that Œ± is parallel to Œ≤. Conditions ‚ë° and ‚ë¢ are not sufficient because they don't necessarily lead to the conclusion that the planes are parallel.**Final Answer**The sufficient conditions are boxed{‚ë†‚ë£}."},{"question":"Calculate the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors ( a ) and ( b ).( a = 3p + 4q )( b = q - p )( |p| = 2.5 )( |q| = 2 )( angle(p, q) = frac{pi}{2} )","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors, a and b. The vectors are given in terms of other vectors p and q. Let me write down what I know:- Vector a = 3p + 4q- Vector b = q - p- The magnitude of p is 2.5, so |p| = 2.5- The magnitude of q is 2, so |q| = 2- The angle between p and q is œÄ/2, which is 90 degrees.I remember that the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors is the magnitude of their cross product. So, the area S is |a √ó b|.First, I need to compute the cross product of a and b. Since a and b are expressed in terms of p and q, I can use the distributive property of the cross product.So, a √ó b = (3p + 4q) √ó (q - p)Let me expand this:= 3p √ó q + 3p √ó (-p) + 4q √ó q + 4q √ó (-p)Simplify each term:- 3p √ó q stays as it is.- 3p √ó (-p) is -3(p √ó p)- 4q √ó q is 4(q √ó q)- 4q √ó (-p) is -4(q √ó p)Now, I remember that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. So, p √ó p = 0 and q √ó q = 0. That simplifies the expression:= 3(p √ó q) - 3(0) + 4(0) - 4(q √ó p)= 3(p √ó q) - 4(q √ó p)I also recall that the cross product is anti-commutative, meaning q √ó p = - (p √ó q). So, I can rewrite the last term:= 3(p √ó q) - 4(- (p √ó q))= 3(p √ó q) + 4(p √ó q)= (3 + 4)(p √ó q)= 7(p √ó q)So, a √ó b = 7(p √ó q).

We know |p| = 2.5, |q| = 2, and the angle between p and q is œÄ/2, which is 90 degrees. The sine of 90 degrees is 1.So, |p √ó q| = |p||q|sin(œÄ/2) = 2.5 * 2 * 1 = 5.Therefore, |a √ó b| = |7(p √ó q)| = 7 * |p √ó q| = 7 * 5 = 35.So, the area of the parallelogram is 35.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Expanded the cross product correctly.2. Recognized that p √ó p and q √ó q are zero.3. Applied the anti-commutative property correctly to q √ó p.4.

I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I think I need to simplify it by combining like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable, right? So, I should look for terms with x and terms with y separately.First, let's identify the terms with x. I see -x and -2x. So, combining those should be straightforward. If I have -x minus 2x, that's like having -1x minus 2x, which should give me -3x. Okay, that seems right.Now, for the y terms. I have y and -3y. So, combining those, it's like 1y minus 3y, which should be -2y. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yeah, if I have one y and then subtract three y's, that leaves me with negative two y's.

It is known that one of the 16 coins is a commemorative coin. How can you determine whether the commemorative coin is lighter or heavier using a balance scale in three weighings?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where there are 16 coins. Out of these, 8 are heavier, each weighing 11 grams, and the other 8 are lighter, each weighing 10 grams. But I don't know which ones are heavier or lighter. Among these 16 coins, one is a special commemorative coin, and I need to figure out if this commemorative coin is lighter or heavier using a balance scale in just three weighings. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.First, I need to understand what a balance scale can do. It can compare two groups of coins and tell me if they're equal, or if one side is heavier than the other. But I can't get exact weights, just relative comparisons. So, with three weighings, I need to design a strategy that narrows down the possibilities to determine the weight of the commemorative coin.Let me think about the total number of coins and how they're divided. There are 16 coins, 8 heavy and 8 light. The commemorative coin is one of these 16, so it's either heavy or light. My goal is to find out which.Maybe I can start by dividing the coins into groups and comparing them. If I can isolate the commemorative coin in a way that its weight affects the balance, that would help. But I need to do this in three steps.Let me consider the first weighing. If I divide the 16 coins into two groups of 8 and weigh them against each other, what would that tell me? Well, if the two groups are equal, that means each group has the same number of heavy and light coins. But since the commemorative coin is in one of these groups, I wouldn't know anything specific about it. So maybe that's not the best approach.Alternatively, what if I set aside the commemorative coin and weigh the remaining 15 coins? But 15 isn't easily divisible into two equal groups. Maybe I can weigh 7 against 7, leaving one aside. If I do that, and the two groups of 7 are equal, then the commemorative coin is the one left aside, but I still don't know if it's heavy or light. If they're unequal, then the commemorative coin is in one of the groups, but I still don't know which.Hmm, perhaps I need a different strategy. Maybe I can use the commemorative coin in the weighings to see how it affects the balance.Let me try this: In the first weighing, I'll put the commemorative coin on one side and one other coin on the other side. If they balance, then the commemorative coin is the same weight as the other coin, which could be either heavy or light. But I don't know which, so that might not help much.Wait, but if I know that there are equal numbers of heavy and light coins, maybe I can use that information. If I weigh the commemorative coin against another coin, and they don't balance, then I know the commemorative coin is either heavier or lighter than that other coin. But since I don't know the weight of the other coin, I still can't determine the commemorative coin's weight.Maybe I need to involve more coins in each weighing to get more information. Let's think about dividing the coins into three groups: two groups of 5 and one group of 6, including the commemorative coin. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.Wait, another idea: Since there are 8 heavy and 8 light coins, the total weight of all 16 coins is 16 * 10.5 grams, which is 168 grams. But I don't think that helps directly because I can't measure total weight, only compare groups.Perhaps I need to use a process of elimination. If I can create weighings where the commemorative coin is in different groups each time, I can see how its presence affects the balance.Let me try this approach:First weighing: Weigh 5 coins against 5 coins, including the commemorative coin in one of the groups. If the two groups balance, then the commemorative coin is in the remaining 6 coins. If they don't balance, then the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group, depending on which side it was on.But I'm not sure if that's the best way to start. Maybe I should include the commemorative coin in each weighing to track its effect.Alternatively, I can use a method where I move coins between weighings to see how the balance changes. For example, in the first weighing, weigh 6 coins against 6 coins, keeping the commemorative coin aside. If they balance, then the commemorative coin is among the remaining 4 coins. If they don't balance, then the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.But I still need to figure out how to determine if it's heavy or light in the next weighings.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that there are equal numbers of heavy and light coins. If I can create a situation where the number of heavy and light coins on each side is known, I can deduce the weight of the commemorative coin.Let me try to outline a possible strategy:1. First weighing: Divide the 16 coins into three groups: two groups of 5 coins and one group of 6 coins (including the commemorative coin). Weigh the two groups of 5 against each other.   - If they balance, then the commemorative coin is in the group of 6, and the two groups of 5 each have 2 heavy and 3 light coins (since there are 8 heavy and 8 light in total).   - If they don't balance, then the heavier group has more heavy coins, and the lighter group has more light coins. The commemorative coin is in one of these groups, but we don't know which yet.2. Second weighing: Depending on the result of the first weighing, proceed accordingly.   - If the first weighing balanced, take the group of 6 (including the commemorative coin) and divide it into two groups of 3. Weigh them against each other.     - If they balance, the commemorative coin is the remaining one, but we still don't know its weight.     - If they don't balance, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group, but we still need to determine its weight.   - If the first weighing didn't balance, take the heavier group and the lighter group and redistribute them for the second weighing to isolate the commemorative coin.3. Third weighing: Use the information from the first two weighings to determine the weight of the commemorative coin by comparing it directly with a known reference or by balancing it against a specific group.Hmm, I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way. Maybe I need a different approach.Another idea: Since there are 8 heavy and 8 light coins, and one is special, I can use the balance to compare groups in a way that the commemorative coin's weight will tip the balance in a predictable manner.Let me try this:First weighing: Weigh 6 coins against 6 coins, including the commemorative coin in one of the groups. Keep 4 coins aside.- If the two groups balance, then the commemorative coin is among the 4 aside, and the 12 coins on the scale are 6 heavy and 6 light.- If they don't balance, then the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group, depending on which side it was on.Second weighing: Depending on the first result.- If balanced, take the 4 aside and weigh 3 against 3 from the balanced group.  - If they balance, the commemorative coin is the remaining one, but we still don't know its weight.  - If they don't balance, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.- If the first weighing was unbalanced, take the heavier or lighter group and redistribute them to isolate the commemorative coin.Third weighing: Use the information to directly compare the commemorative coin with a known reference or within a smaller group to determine its weight.Wait, I'm still not getting a clear path. Maybe I need to think differently.Perhaps I can use the fact that there are equal numbers of heavy and light coins to create a reference group.Let me try this:First weighing: Weigh 5 coins against 5 coins, including the commemorative coin in one group.- If they balance, the commemorative coin is among the remaining 6, and the 10 coins on the scale are 5 heavy and 5 light.- If they don't balance, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.Second weighing: If the first was balanced, take the 6 remaining coins and weigh 3 against 3.- If they balance, the commemorative coin is the remaining one, but we don't know its weight.- If they don't balance, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.Third weighing: If needed, weigh the suspected coin against a known reference to determine its weight.But I'm still not sure if this guarantees a solution in three weighings.Wait, maybe I need to involve the commemorative coin in each weighing to track its effect.Let me try this strategy:First weighing: Weigh the commemorative coin against another coin.- If they balance, the commemorative coin is the same weight as that coin, but we don't know if it's heavy or light.- If they don't balance, we know the commemorative coin is heavier or lighter than that coin, but we don't know the absolute weight.Second weighing: Take the commemorative coin and weigh it against a different coin.- If it balances again, we still don't know.- If it doesn't balance, we can compare the two results to determine if the commemorative coin is heavy or light.But this seems too simplistic and might not account for all possibilities.Alternatively, maybe I can use the commemorative coin in a group weighing to see how it affects the balance.First weighing: Weigh 5 coins including the commemorative coin against 5 other coins.- If they balance, the commemorative coin is among the remaining 6.- If they don't balance, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.Second weighing: Depending on the first result, isolate the commemorative coin further.Third weighing: Directly compare the commemorative coin with a known reference or within a smaller group to determine its weight.I think this is getting closer, but I need to formalize it.Let me try to outline a step-by-step plan:1. First weighing: Divide the 16 coins into three groups: two groups of 5 coins and one group of 6 coins (including the commemorative coin). Weigh the two groups of 5 against each other.   - If they balance, the commemorative coin is in the group of 6.   - If they don't balance, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.2. Second weighing:   - If the first weighing balanced, take the group of 6 (including the commemorative coin) and divide it into two groups of 3. Weigh them against each other.     - If they balance, the commemorative coin is the remaining one.     - If they don't balance, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.   - If the first weighing didn't balance, take the heavier group and weigh it against a new group of 5 coins from the balanced group.     - If they balance, the commemorative coin is in the lighter group.     - If they don't balance, the commemorative coin is in the heavier group.3. Third weighing:   - If the commemorative coin was isolated in the second weighing, weigh it against a known reference coin to determine its weight.   - If it was in a group, weigh it against another coin from the same group to determine if it's heavy or light.This seems like a plausible strategy, but I need to make sure it works in all cases.Wait, in the second weighing, if the first weighing didn't balance, and I take the heavier group and weigh it against a new group of 5 coins from the balanced group, I need to ensure that the new group has a known composition.But since the first weighing had 5 vs 5, and they didn't balance, the heavier group has more heavy coins, and the lighter group has more light coins. The balanced group (if any) would have an equal number of heavy and light coins.So, if I take the heavier group and weigh it against 5 coins from the balanced group, which has 2 heavy and 3 light coins (assuming the first weighing had 5 heavy vs 5 light, but that's not necessarily the case).Wait, actually, in the first weighing, if I have 5 vs 5, and they don't balance, the heavier side has more heavy coins, and the lighter side has more light coins. The remaining 6 coins (including the commemorative coin) would have the remaining heavy and light coins.So, if I take the heavier group and weigh it against 5 coins from the remaining 6, I can determine if the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I need to think in terms of information theory. With three weighings, I can get 3 bits of information, which is 8 possible outcomes. Since there are 16 coins, each can be heavy or light, but we're only interested in one specific coin. So, it's feasible.I think the key is to use the balance to compare groups in a way that the commemorative coin's weight affects the outcome in a predictable manner.Let me try to formalize the steps:First Weighing:- Weigh 6 coins against 6 coins, including the commemorative coin in one of the groups. Keep 4 coins aside.   - If balanced, the commemorative coin is among the 4 aside.   - If not balanced, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.Second Weighing:- If first weighing was balanced:   - Weigh 3 of the 4 aside against 3 known reference coins (from the balanced group).     - If balanced, the commemorative coin is the remaining one.     - If not balanced, the commemorative coin is in the heavier or lighter group.- If first weighing was not balanced:   - Take the heavier group and weigh it against a new group of 6 coins (including 5 from the balanced group and 1 from the lighter group).     - If balanced, the commemorative coin is in the lighter group.     - If not balanced, the commemorative coin is in the heavier group.Third Weighing:- If the commemorative coin was isolated in the second weighing, weigh it against a known reference coin to determine its weight.- If it was in a group, weigh it against another coin from the same group to determine if it's heavy or light.This seems like a solid plan. Let me test it with an example.Suppose the commemorative coin is heavy.First Weighing: 6 vs 6, including the commemorative coin. Since it's heavy, the side with the commemorative coin will be heavier.Second Weighing: Take the heavier group and weigh it against 5 from the balanced group and 1 from the lighter group. Since the commemorative coin is heavy, the side with the commemorative coin will still be heavier.Third Weighing: Weigh the commemorative coin against a known reference coin. It will be heavier.If the commemorative coin was light, the process would be similar but the balance would tip the other way.I think this strategy works. It systematically isolates the commemorative coin and determines its weight in three weighings."},{"question":"Lines l_1 and l_2 pass through the origin with first-quadrant angles of frac{pi}{45} and frac{pi}{36} radians with the positive x-axis, respectively. For any line l, the transformation R(l) produces another line by first reflecting l in l_1 and then the result in l_2. Let R^{(1)}(l)=R(l) and R^{(n)}(l)=Rleft(R^{(n-1)}(l)right). Given that l is the line y=frac{2}{11}x, find the smallest positive integer m for which R^{(m)}(l)=l.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two lines, l‚ÇÅ and l‚ÇÇ, passing through the origin. They make angles of œÄ/45 and œÄ/36 radians with the positive x-axis in the first quadrant. There's a transformation R(l) that reflects a line l first in l‚ÇÅ and then in l‚ÇÇ. I need to find the smallest positive integer m such that applying this transformation m times brings the original line l back to itself. The line l is given as y = (2/11)x.Alright, let me break this down. First, I know that reflecting a line over another line can be thought of in terms of angles. If I have a line making an angle Œ∏ with the x-axis, reflecting it over another line making an angle Œ± with the x-axis will result in a new line making an angle of 2Œ± - Œ∏ with the x-axis. That makes sense because reflection over a line essentially flips the angle over that line.So, in this case, we have two reflections: first over l‚ÇÅ, which is at œÄ/45, and then over l‚ÇÇ, which is at œÄ/36. Let me denote the angle of the original line l as Œ∏. Since l is y = (2/11)x, tanŒ∏ = 2/11. I don't think I need the exact value of Œ∏, just that it's some angle in the first quadrant.Let me denote Œ± = œÄ/45 and Œ≤ = œÄ/36. So, the first reflection over l‚ÇÅ will take Œ∏ to 2Œ± - Œ∏. Then, reflecting that result over l‚ÇÇ will take 2Œ± - Œ∏ to 2Œ≤ - (2Œ± - Œ∏). Simplifying that, it becomes 2Œ≤ - 2Œ± + Œ∏. So, each transformation R(l) adds 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) to the angle Œ∏.Wait, so each time I apply R, the angle increases by 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). So, after m transformations, the angle would be Œ∏ + m * 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). For the line to come back to itself, this angle must differ from Œ∏ by an integer multiple of 2œÄ, right? Because angles are periodic with period 2œÄ.So, I need Œ∏ + m * 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) ‚â° Œ∏ mod 2œÄ. That simplifies to m * 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) ‚â° 0 mod 2œÄ. Dividing both sides by 2, we get m*(Œ≤ - Œ±) ‚â° 0 mod œÄ.So, m*(Œ≤ - Œ±) must be an integer multiple of œÄ. Let me compute Œ≤ - Œ±. Œ≤ is œÄ/36 and Œ± is œÄ/45. So, Œ≤ - Œ± = œÄ/36 - œÄ/45. To subtract these, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 36 and 45 is 180. So, œÄ/36 is 5œÄ/180 and œÄ/45 is 4œÄ/180. Therefore, Œ≤ - Œ± = (5œÄ - 4œÄ)/180 = œÄ/180.So, m*(œÄ/180) must be an integer multiple of œÄ. Let me write that as m*(œÄ/180) = kœÄ, where k is an integer. Dividing both sides by œÄ, we get m/180 = k, so m = 180k.Since we need the smallest positive integer m, k should be 1. Therefore, m = 180. Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check.Wait, earlier I had m*(Œ≤ - Œ±) ‚â° 0 mod œÄ, which is m*(œÄ/180) ‚â° 0 mod œÄ. So, m*(œÄ/180) must be an integer multiple of œÄ. So, m*(1/180) must be an integer. Therefore, m must be a multiple of 180. So, the smallest positive integer m is 180.But wait, in the initial step, I thought that each R adds 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). Let me confirm that. So, reflecting over l‚ÇÅ gives 2Œ± - Œ∏, then reflecting that over l‚ÇÇ gives 2Œ≤ - (2Œ± - Œ∏) = 2Œ≤ - 2Œ± + Œ∏. So, the total change is (2Œ≤ - 2Œ± + Œ∏) - Œ∏ = 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). So, yes, each R adds 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). So, the total change after m transformations is 2m(Œ≤ - Œ±). Therefore, 2m(Œ≤ - Œ±) must be an integer multiple of 2œÄ.So, 2m(Œ≤ - Œ±) = 2kœÄ. Dividing both sides by 2, we get m(Œ≤ - Œ±) = kœÄ. So, m*(œÄ/180) = kœÄ. Therefore, m/180 = k, so m = 180k. So, the smallest positive integer m is 180.Wait, but in the initial problem, the transformation R(l) is reflecting first in l‚ÇÅ and then in l‚ÇÇ. So, is the total rotation angle 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) or 2(Œ± - Œ≤)? Let me think. If I reflect over l‚ÇÅ first, which is at Œ±, then over l‚ÇÇ at Œ≤. So, the composition of two reflections is a rotation. The angle of rotation is 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). Because reflecting over l‚ÇÅ and then l‚ÇÇ is equivalent to a rotation about the origin by twice the angle between l‚ÇÇ and l‚ÇÅ. Since l‚ÇÇ is at a larger angle than l‚ÇÅ (œÄ/36 > œÄ/45), the rotation is counterclockwise by 2(Œ≤ - Œ±).So, each R(l) is a rotation by 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). Therefore, to get back to the original line, the total rotation must be an integer multiple of 2œÄ. So, m * 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) = 2œÄ * k, where k is an integer. Simplifying, m*(Œ≤ - Œ±) = œÄ * k.As before, Œ≤ - Œ± = œÄ/180, so m*(œÄ/180) = œÄ * k. Dividing both sides by œÄ, m/180 = k. Therefore, m must be a multiple of 180. The smallest positive integer m is 180.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had a different answer. They said m = 360. Let me see why.Wait, in their solution, they said that the transformation R(l) results in an angle Œ∏ + n * 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). So, for R^m(l) = l, we need 2(Œ≤ - Œ±)*m = 2kœÄ. So, m*(Œ≤ - Œ±) = kœÄ. Then, since Œ≤ - Œ± = œÄ/180, m*(œÄ/180) = kœÄ, so m = 180k. So, the smallest m is 180.But in their solution, they wrote m = 360. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Let me check their steps.They said: \\"The transformation R^{(n)}(l) results in a line making an angle Œ∏ + n * 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) with the x-axis. For R^{(m)}(l)=l, we need 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) * m = 2kœÄ for some integer k.\\"Then, 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) = 2*(œÄ/36 - œÄ/45) = 2*(5œÄ/180 - 4œÄ/180) = 2*(œÄ/180) = œÄ/90.Wait, hold on. Wait, 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±) is 2*(œÄ/36 - œÄ/45). Let me compute that correctly.œÄ/36 is approximately 0.087266 radians, and œÄ/45 is approximately 0.069813 radians. So, Œ≤ - Œ± is approximately 0.017453 radians, which is œÄ/180. So, 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±) is 2*(œÄ/180) = œÄ/90.So, in their solution, they said 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) = œÄ/180, but that's incorrect. It should be 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±) = œÄ/90.Wait, let me compute 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±):Œ≤ = œÄ/36, Œ± = œÄ/45.Œ≤ - Œ± = œÄ/36 - œÄ/45 = (5œÄ - 4œÄ)/180 = œÄ/180.So, 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±) = 2œÄ/180 = œÄ/90.So, in their solution, they had 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) = œÄ/180, which is incorrect. It should be œÄ/90.Therefore, their equation was m*(œÄ/180) = 2œÄ*k, leading to m = 360k, so m=360. But that's wrong because 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±) is œÄ/90, not œÄ/180.So, in reality, the correct equation is m*(œÄ/90) = 2œÄ*k, which simplifies to m/90 = 2k, so m = 180k. Therefore, the smallest positive integer m is 180.Wait, but let me think again. If each R(l) is a rotation by 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) = œÄ/90, then to get a full rotation, we need m*(œÄ/90) = 2œÄ*k. So, m = (2œÄ*k)/(œÄ/90) = 180k. So, yes, m must be a multiple of 180. So, the smallest m is 180.Therefore, the correct answer should be 180, not 360.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had written:\\"Given that l is the line y = (2/11)x, find the smallest positive integer m for which R^{(m)}(l) = l.\\"And in their solution, they said:\\"2(Œ≤ - Œ±) = 2*(œÄ/36 - œÄ/45) = œÄ/180, so m = 2œÄ / (œÄ/180) = 360.\\"But that's incorrect because 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±) is œÄ/90, not œÄ/180. So, their calculation was wrong.Therefore, the correct answer should be 180.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, the transformation R(l) is reflecting first in l‚ÇÅ, then in l‚ÇÇ. So, the composition of two reflections is a rotation. The angle of rotation is 2*(angle between l‚ÇÇ and l‚ÇÅ). Since l‚ÇÇ is at Œ≤ and l‚ÇÅ is at Œ±, the angle between them is Œ≤ - Œ±. Therefore, the rotation is 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±). So, each R(l) is a rotation by 2*(Œ≤ - Œ±).Therefore, to get back to the original line, we need the total rotation to be an integer multiple of 2œÄ. So, m*2*(Œ≤ - Œ±) = 2œÄ*k.Simplify: m*(Œ≤ - Œ±) = œÄ*k.Given that Œ≤ - Œ± = œÄ/180, so m*(œÄ/180) = œÄ*k.Divide both sides by œÄ: m/180 = k.Therefore, m must be a multiple of 180. The smallest positive integer m is 180.Therefore, the correct answer is 180.But wait, in the initial problem, the user had written m = 360. So, perhaps they made a mistake in their calculation.Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the effect of the reflections.Wait, let me think about the reflection formulas again.If I have a line making an angle Œ∏ with the x-axis, reflecting it over a line making an angle Œ± with the x-axis results in a new line making an angle of 2Œ± - Œ∏ with the x-axis.So, reflecting l over l‚ÇÅ (angle Œ±) gives 2Œ± - Œ∏.Then, reflecting that result over l‚ÇÇ (angle Œ≤) gives 2Œ≤ - (2Œ± - Œ∏) = 2Œ≤ - 2Œ± + Œ∏.So, the total change is Œ∏ + 2(Œ≤ - Œ±). So, each R(l) adds 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) to the angle.Therefore, after m transformations, the angle is Œ∏ + 2m(Œ≤ - Œ±).For the line to return to its original position, Œ∏ + 2m(Œ≤ - Œ±) must be congruent to Œ∏ modulo 2œÄ.So, 2m(Œ≤ - Œ±) ‚â° 0 mod 2œÄ.Divide both sides by 2: m(Œ≤ - Œ±) ‚â° 0 mod œÄ.So, m(Œ≤ - Œ±) must be an integer multiple of œÄ.Given that Œ≤ - Œ± = œÄ/180, so m*(œÄ/180) = kœÄ, where k is integer.Divide both sides by œÄ: m/180 = k.Therefore, m must be a multiple of 180. The smallest positive integer m is 180.So, yes, the correct answer is 180.Therefore, the initial solution by the user was incorrect because they miscalculated 2(Œ≤ - Œ±) as œÄ/180 instead of œÄ/90.So, the correct answer is 180."},{"question":"What value of x will give the minimum value of 3x^2 - 18x + 7?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of x that gives the minimum value of the quadratic expression 3x¬≤ - 18x + 7. Hmm, quadratic expressions, right? They graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of x¬≤ is positive (which is 3 in this case), the parabola opens upwards. That means the vertex of the parabola is the lowest point, so that's where the minimum value occurs. Cool, so I need to find the vertex of this quadratic.Wait, how do I find the vertex of a quadratic equation? I remember there are a couple of methods. One is completing the square, and another is using the vertex formula. Let me think about both.First, completing the square. I think that involves rewriting the quadratic in the form a(x - h)¬≤ + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Let me try that.Starting with the expression: 3x¬≤ - 18x + 7.I notice that the coefficient of x¬≤ is 3, not 1, so I should factor out the 3 first to make completing the square easier. Let's see:3x¬≤ - 18x + 7 = 3(x¬≤ - 6x) + 7.Okay, now inside the parentheses, I have x¬≤ - 6x. To complete the square, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x. The coefficient here is -6, so half of that is -3, and squaring that gives 9. So I'll add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses:= 3(x¬≤ - 6x + 9 - 9) + 7.Wait, but since I factored out a 3 earlier, adding 9 inside the parentheses actually adds 3*9 = 27 to the expression. To balance that, I need to subtract 27 outside. Let me write that:= 3[(x¬≤ - 6x + 9) - 9] + 7= 3(x - 3)¬≤ - 27 + 7= 3(x - 3)¬≤ - 20.So, in vertex form, the expression is 3(x - 3)¬≤ - 20. That means the vertex is at (3, -20). Since the parabola opens upwards, this vertex is the minimum point. Therefore, the value of x that gives the minimum is 3.Wait, let me double-check using the vertex formula. The vertex formula for a quadratic ax¬≤ + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a is 3 and b is -18. Plugging in:x = -(-18)/(2*3) = 18/6 = 3.Yep, that confirms it. So both methods give me x = 3 as the point where the minimum occurs. I think that's solid. Just to be thorough, maybe I can plug x = 3 back into the original equation to find the minimum value:3(3)¬≤ - 18(3) + 7 = 3*9 - 54 + 7 = 27 - 54 + 7 = -20.That matches the vertex form result, so everything checks out. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Both methods lead to the same answer, and plugging it back in gives the correct minimum value. So I'm confident that x = 3 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( x ) that gives the minimum value is boxed{3}."},{"question":"To test students' physical fitness indicators, 4 items are randomly selected from 8 items in swimming, 1 item, ball games, 3 items, and track and field, 4 items. The probability of each category being selected is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about probability, and I need to figure out the chance that each category is selected when choosing 4 items out of 8. The categories are swimming, ball games, and track and field, with 1, 3, and 4 items respectively. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I think I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The problem says, \\"The probability of each category being selected is ____.\\" So, does that mean the probability that one item is selected from each category? That is, one from swimming, one from ball games, and two from track and field? Or does it mean the probability that each category is represented in the selection? I think it's the latter‚Äîmeaning that in the 4 items selected, each category is represented at least once. So, swimming, ball games, and track and field each have at least one item selected.Alright, so to find this probability, I need to figure out two things: the total number of ways to select 4 items out of 8, and the number of favorable ways where each category is represented at least once. Then, the probability would be the ratio of these two numbers.Let's start with the total number of ways to select 4 items from 8. That's a combination problem, right? The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.So, total ways = C(8, 4). Let me calculate that:C(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8 - 4)!) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 70.Okay, so there are 70 possible ways to select any 4 items from the 8 available.Now, I need to find the number of favorable ways where each category is represented at least once. Since there are three categories, and we're selecting 4 items, one category will have two items selected, and the other two categories will have one item each. But which category gets two items? It could be any of the three, but in this case, swimming only has one item, so it can't have two items selected. Therefore, the category with two items must be either ball games or track and field.Wait, let me think about that again. If swimming only has one item, then it can only contribute one item to the selection. So, the remaining three items must come from ball games and track and field. But since we need each category to be represented, ball games and track and field must each contribute at least one item. So, the distribution of the remaining three items would be either 1 from ball games and 2 from track and field, or 2 from ball games and 1 from track and field.Therefore, there are two scenarios:1. 1 from swimming, 1 from ball games, and 2 from track and field.2. 1 from swimming, 2 from ball games, and 1 from track and field.I need to calculate the number of ways for each scenario and then add them together to get the total number of favorable ways.Let's start with the first scenario: 1 from swimming, 1 from ball games, and 2 from track and field.Swimming has only 1 item, so the number of ways to choose 1 from swimming is C(1, 1) = 1.Ball games have 3 items, so the number of ways to choose 1 from ball games is C(3, 1) = 3.Track and field have 4 items, so the number of ways to choose 2 from track and field is C(4, 2). Let me calculate that:C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6.So, the number of ways for the first scenario is 1 * 3 * 6 = 18.Now, the second scenario: 1 from swimming, 2 from ball games, and 1 from track and field.Swimming again is C(1, 1) = 1.Ball games now need to contribute 2 items, so C(3, 2). Let me compute that:C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3 - 2)!) = (3 * 2) / (2 * 1) = 3.Track and field needs to contribute 1 item, so C(4, 1) = 4.Therefore, the number of ways for the second scenario is 1 * 3 * 4 = 12.Adding both scenarios together, the total number of favorable ways is 18 + 12 = 30.So, the probability is the number of favorable ways divided by the total number of ways, which is 30 / 70.Simplifying that fraction, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 10, so 30 √∑ 10 = 3, and 70 √∑ 10 = 7. Therefore, the probability is 3/7.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, total ways are 70, favorable ways are 30, so 30/70 reduces to 3/7. That seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion?The idea would be to calculate the total number of ways, subtract the number of ways where at least one category is missing.So, total ways: C(8, 4) = 70.Now, subtract the number of ways where swimming is not selected, ball games are not selected, or track and field are not selected.But wait, swimming only has one item, so if we don't select swimming, we're selecting all 4 items from ball games and track and field, which have 3 + 4 = 7 items. So, the number of ways without swimming is C(7, 4).Similarly, the number of ways without ball games is selecting all 4 items from swimming and track and field, which have 1 + 4 = 5 items. So, C(5, 4).And the number of ways without track and field is selecting all 4 items from swimming and ball games, which have 1 + 3 = 4 items. So, C(4, 4).But wait, inclusion-exclusion also requires us to add back the cases where two categories are missing, because we subtracted them twice.However, in this case, can we have two categories missing? Let's see:- Missing swimming and ball games: We'd have to select 4 items from track and field, which has 4 items. So, C(4, 4) = 1.- Missing swimming and track and field: We'd have to select 4 items from ball games, which only has 3 items. So, C(3, 4) = 0, since you can't select more items than available.- Missing ball games and track and field: We'd have to select 4 items from swimming, which only has 1 item. So, C(1, 4) = 0.Therefore, the number of ways missing two categories is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.And finally, the number of ways missing all three categories is obviously 0, since we can't select items from nothing.So, applying inclusion-exclusion:Number of ways with at least one category missing = (C(7,4) + C(5,4) + C(4,4)) - (C(4,4) + C(3,4) + C(1,4)) + C(0,4).But since C(3,4) and C(1,4) are 0, and C(0,4) is also 0, this simplifies to:= (C(7,4) + C(5,4) + C(4,4)) - C(4,4)= (35 + 5 + 1) - 1= 41 - 1= 40.Wait, that doesn't seem right because earlier we found that the number of favorable ways is 30, so the number of ways with at least one category missing should be 70 - 30 = 40. So, that matches.Therefore, the number of favorable ways is indeed 30, and the probability is 30/70 = 3/7.So, both methods give the same result, which makes me more confident that the answer is correct.Just to recap:Total ways: 70.Favorable ways: 30.Probability: 30/70 = 3/7.Yes, that seems solid.**Final Answer**The probability of each category being selected is boxed{dfrac{3}{7}}."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system, with the origin as the pole and the positive half-axis of the x-axis as the polar axis, a polar coordinate system is established.

Hmm, I remember that in polar coordinates, ( rho cos(theta - alpha) ) represents the equation of a line. Specifically, it's the equation of a line in polar form where ( alpha ) is the angle the line makes with the polar axis (the x-axis).

Let me rewrite this to match the standard form:Divide both sides by 2: ( rho cosleft(theta - frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).So, this is a line at a distance of ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) from the origin, making an angle of ( frac{pi}{6} ) with the x-axis. To convert this into Cartesian coordinates, I remember that ( rho cos(theta - alpha) = x cos alpha + y sin alpha ). So, substituting ( alpha = frac{pi}{6} ), we get:( x cosleft(frac{pi}{6}right) + y sinleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).Calculating the trigonometric values:( cosleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) and ( sinleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{1}{2} ).So, substituting these in:( x cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + y cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:( sqrt{3}x + y = sqrt{3} ).Okay, so the Cartesian equation of line ( l ) is ( sqrt{3}x + y = sqrt{3} ). Now, to write the parametric equations. I know that parametric equations of a line can be written as:( x = x_0 + at )( y = y_0 + bt )where ( (x_0, y_0) ) is a point on the line and ( langle a, b rangle ) is the direction vector.First, I need a point on the line. Let me choose when ( x = 0 ):( sqrt{3}(0) + y = sqrt{3} ) => ( y = sqrt{3} ). So, the point is ( (0, sqrt{3}) ).Next, the direction vector. The line ( sqrt{3}x + y = sqrt{3} ) can be rewritten in slope-intercept form to find the slope.Subtract ( sqrt{3}x ) from both sides:( y = -sqrt{3}x + sqrt{3} ).So, the slope ( m = -sqrt{3} ). The direction vector can be found from the slope. Since slope is ( frac{Delta y}{Delta x} = -sqrt{3} ), a direction vector is ( langle 1, -sqrt{3} rangle ). However, sometimes people prefer direction vectors with integer components, so maybe scaling it up.Alternatively, another way is to find a direction vector perpendicular to the normal vector of the line. The normal vector of the line ( sqrt{3}x + y = sqrt{3} ) is ( langle sqrt{3}, 1 rangle ). A direction vector perpendicular to this would satisfy ( sqrt{3}a + b = 0 ). So, if I take ( a = 1 ), then ( b = -sqrt{3} ). So, direction vector is ( langle 1, -sqrt{3} rangle ).But wait, in parametric equations, the direction vector can be any scalar multiple. Alternatively, sometimes people use a unit vector, but it's not necessary. So, let me just use ( langle 1, -sqrt{3} rangle ).But let me check the given solution. They have parametric equations:( x = -frac{1}{2}t )( y = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t )Hmm, so their direction vector is ( langle -frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} rangle ). Let me see why.Maybe they chose a different direction vector. Since the slope is ( -sqrt{3} ), the direction vector can also be ( langle 1, -sqrt{3} rangle ) or ( langle -1, sqrt{3} rangle ). Alternatively, they might have chosen a direction vector with a specific magnitude or orientation.Wait, let's compute the direction vector from the parametric equations given. If ( x = -frac{1}{2}t ) and ( y = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t ), then the direction vector is ( langle -frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} rangle ). The slope of this direction vector is ( frac{sqrt{3}/2}{-1/2} = -sqrt{3} ), which matches the slope of the line. So, that's correct.Alternatively, if I had chosen ( langle 1, -sqrt{3} rangle ), the parametric equations would be:( x = 0 + 1 cdot t )( y = sqrt{3} + (-sqrt{3}) cdot t )Which simplifies to:( x = t )( y = sqrt{3} - sqrt{3}t )But the given solution uses a different parameterization. Maybe they scaled the direction vector differently.Wait, perhaps they used a different point as the starting point? No, they still start at ( (0, sqrt{3}) ). So, why is the direction vector different?Let me think. The direction vector can be any vector parallel to the line. The given direction vector is ( langle -frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} rangle ). Let me compute its magnitude: ( sqrt{(-frac{1}{2})^2 + (frac{sqrt{3}}{2})^2} = sqrt{frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{4}} = sqrt{1} = 1 ). So, it's a unit direction vector. So, perhaps they chose a unit direction vector for simplicity. That's a common practice. So, if I want to write parametric equations with a unit direction vector, I can do that as well.But in any case, both parametrizations are correct, just using different direction vectors. So, the given parametric equations are correct.So, for part (1), the parametric equations are:( x = -frac{1}{2}t )( y = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t )Alright, moving on to part (2). We need to find the distance between points ( A ) and ( B ) where line ( l ) intersects curve ( C ).First, let me write down the equation of curve ( C ): ( rho^2 = frac{12}{2 + cos^2 theta} ).I need to convert this into Cartesian coordinates to make it easier to work with. Let me recall that ( rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 ), and ( cos theta = frac{x}{rho} ). So, ( cos^2 theta = frac{x^2}{rho^2} ).Substituting into the equation:( rho^2 = frac{12}{2 + frac{x^2}{rho^2}} )Multiply numerator and denominator by ( rho^2 ):( rho^2 = frac{12 rho^2}{2 rho^2 + x^2} )Multiply both sides by ( 2 rho^2 + x^2 ):( rho^2 (2 rho^2 + x^2) = 12 rho^2 )Divide both sides by ( rho^2 ) (assuming ( rho neq 0 )):( 2 rho^2 + x^2 = 12 )But ( rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 ), so substitute:( 2(x^2 + y^2) + x^2 = 12 )Simplify:( 2x^2 + 2y^2 + x^2 = 12 )Combine like terms:( 3x^2 + 2y^2 = 12 )Divide both sides by 12 to write in standard form:( frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{6} = 1 )So, curve ( C ) is an ellipse with semi-major axis ( sqrt{6} ) along the y-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the x-axis.Now, we have the line ( l ) with parametric equations:( x = -frac{1}{2}t )( y = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t )We need to substitute these into the ellipse equation to find the points of intersection.Substitute ( x ) and ( y ) into ( frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{6} = 1 ):First, compute ( x^2 ):( x = -frac{1}{2}t ) => ( x^2 = left(-frac{1}{2}tright)^2 = frac{1}{4}t^2 )Compute ( y^2 ):( y = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t )So, ( y^2 = left(sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}tright)^2 )Let me expand this:( (sqrt{3})^2 + 2 cdot sqrt{3} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}tright)^2 )Simplify term by term:First term: ( 3 )Second term: ( 2 cdot sqrt{3} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t = 2 cdot frac{3}{2}t = 3t )Third term: ( frac{3}{4}t^2 )So, altogether:( y^2 = 3 + 3t + frac{3}{4}t^2 )Now, substitute ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) into the ellipse equation:( frac{frac{1}{4}t^2}{4} + frac{3 + 3t + frac{3}{4}t^2}{6} = 1 )Simplify each term:First term: ( frac{1}{16}t^2 )Second term: ( frac{3}{6} + frac{3t}{6} + frac{frac{3}{4}t^2}{6} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2}t + frac{1}{8}t^2 )So, putting it all together:( frac{1}{16}t^2 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2}t + frac{1}{8}t^2 = 1 )Combine like terms:First, combine the ( t^2 ) terms:( frac{1}{16}t^2 + frac{1}{8}t^2 = frac{1}{16}t^2 + frac{2}{16}t^2 = frac{3}{16}t^2 )Next, the ( t ) term: ( frac{1}{2}t )Constant term: ( frac{1}{2} )So, the equation becomes:( frac{3}{16}t^2 + frac{1}{2}t + frac{1}{2} = 1 )Subtract 1 from both sides:( frac{3}{16}t^2 + frac{1}{2}t + frac{1}{2} - 1 = 0 )Simplify constants:( frac{3}{16}t^2 + frac{1}{2}t - frac{1}{2} = 0 )To make it easier, multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:( 3t^2 + 8t - 8 = 0 )So, the quadratic equation is ( 3t^2 + 8t - 8 = 0 ).Let me solve for ( t ) using the quadratic formula:( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Here, ( a = 3 ), ( b = 8 ), ( c = -8 ).Compute discriminant:( b^2 - 4ac = 64 - 4*3*(-8) = 64 + 96 = 160 )So,( t = frac{-8 pm sqrt{160}}{6} )Simplify ( sqrt{160} = sqrt{16*10} = 4sqrt{10} )Thus,( t = frac{-8 pm 4sqrt{10}}{6} )Simplify fractions:Divide numerator and denominator by 2:( t = frac{-4 pm 2sqrt{10}}{3} )So, the two solutions are:( t_1 = frac{-4 + 2sqrt{10}}{3} )( t_2 = frac{-4 - 2sqrt{10}}{3} )So, these are the parameter values where the line intersects the ellipse.Now, to find the distance between points ( A ) and ( B ), which correspond to ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ).In parametric equations, the distance between two points on a line can be found by the magnitude of the difference in the parameter times the magnitude of the direction vector.Wait, but in this case, the parametric equations are:( x = -frac{1}{2}t )( y = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t )So, the direction vector is ( langle -frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} rangle ), which has a magnitude of 1, as we saw earlier.Therefore, the distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is simply the absolute difference of the parameters ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ), because the direction vector is a unit vector.So, ( |AB| = |t_1 - t_2| )Compute ( t_1 - t_2 ):( t_1 - t_2 = frac{-4 + 2sqrt{10}}{3} - frac{-4 - 2sqrt{10}}{3} = frac{-4 + 2sqrt{10} + 4 + 2sqrt{10}}{3} = frac{4sqrt{10}}{3} )So, ( |AB| = frac{4sqrt{10}}{3} )Alternatively, if I didn't realize the direction vector is unit, I could compute the distance using the coordinates.Compute coordinates for ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ):For ( t_1 = frac{-4 + 2sqrt{10}}{3} ):( x_1 = -frac{1}{2} cdot frac{-4 + 2sqrt{10}}{3} = frac{4 - 2sqrt{10}}{6} = frac{2 - sqrt{10}}{3} )( y_1 = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{-4 + 2sqrt{10}}{3} = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}(-4 + 2sqrt{10})}{6} = sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{6} + frac{2sqrt{30}}{6} = sqrt{3} - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{sqrt{30}}{3} )Simplify ( y_1 ):( sqrt{3} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{3} ), so:( y_1 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{3} - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{sqrt{30}}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{sqrt{30}}{3} = frac{sqrt{3} + sqrt{30}}{3} )Similarly, for ( t_2 = frac{-4 - 2sqrt{10}}{3} ):( x_2 = -frac{1}{2} cdot frac{-4 - 2sqrt{10}}{3} = frac{4 + 2sqrt{10}}{6} = frac{2 + sqrt{10}}{3} )( y_2 = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{-4 - 2sqrt{10}}{3} = sqrt{3} + frac{sqrt{3}(-4 - 2sqrt{10})}{6} = sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{6} - frac{2sqrt{30}}{6} = sqrt{3} - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} - frac{sqrt{30}}{3} )Simplify ( y_2 ):( sqrt{3} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{3} ), so:( y_2 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{3} - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} - frac{sqrt{30}}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} - frac{sqrt{30}}{3} = frac{sqrt{3} - sqrt{30}}{3} )Now, points ( A ) and ( B ) are ( left( frac{2 - sqrt{10}}{3}, frac{sqrt{3} + sqrt{30}}{3} right) ) and ( left( frac{2 + sqrt{10}}{3}, frac{sqrt{3} - sqrt{30}}{3} right) ).Compute the distance between ( A ) and ( B ):Use the distance formula:( |AB| = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} )Compute ( x_2 - x_1 ):( frac{2 + sqrt{10}}{3} - frac{2 - sqrt{10}}{3} = frac{2 + sqrt{10} - 2 + sqrt{10}}{3} = frac{2sqrt{10}}{3} )Compute ( y_2 - y_1 ):( frac{sqrt{3} - sqrt{30}}{3} - frac{sqrt{3} + sqrt{30}}{3} = frac{sqrt{3} - sqrt{30} - sqrt{3} - sqrt{30}}{3} = frac{-2sqrt{30}}{3} )So, plug into distance formula:( |AB| = sqrt{left( frac{2sqrt{10}}{3} right)^2 + left( frac{-2sqrt{30}}{3} right)^2 } )Compute squares:( left( frac{2sqrt{10}}{3} right)^2 = frac{4*10}{9} = frac{40}{9} )( left( frac{-2sqrt{30}}{3} right)^2 = frac{4*30}{9} = frac{120}{9} )Add them:( frac{40}{9} + frac{120}{9} = frac{160}{9} )Take square root:( sqrt{frac{160}{9}} = frac{sqrt{160}}{3} = frac{4sqrt{10}}{3} )So, same result as before. Therefore, the distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is ( frac{4sqrt{10}}{3} ).I think that's correct. Let me just recap:1. Converted the polar equation of line ( l ) to Cartesian, then wrote parametric equations.2. Converted the polar equation of curve ( C ) to Cartesian, recognizing it as an ellipse.3. Substituted the parametric equations of the line into the ellipse equation to find the parameter values at intersection points.4. Solved the quadratic equation for ( t ), found two solutions.5. Calculated the distance between the two points using the parameter difference, since the direction vector was a unit vector, which simplified the calculation.6. Verified by computing the coordinates and using the distance formula, arriving at the same result.So, I'm confident that the value of ( |AB| ) is ( frac{4sqrt{10}}{3} ).**Final Answer**The value of ( |AB| ) is boxed{dfrac{4sqrt{10}}{3}}."},{"question":"Given conditions p: there exists a solution for the inequality |x-1|+|x-3| < m involving x; condition q: f(x)=(7-3m)^{x} is a decreasing function. The condition p is a (    ) condition for q to hold.A: Sufficient but not necessaryB: Necessary but not sufficientC: Necessary and sufficientD: Neither sufficient nor necessary","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here with two conditions, p and q, and I need to figure out what kind of condition p is for q to hold. The options are whether p is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let's understand condition p. It says that there exists a solution for the inequality |x - 1| + |x - 3| < m. Hmm, okay. So, this is an absolute value inequality involving x. I remember that absolute value expressions can represent distances on the number line. So, |x - 1| is the distance between x and 1, and |x - 3| is the distance between x and 3. So, adding these two gives the sum of distances from x to 1 and x to 3.I think there's a property here that the sum of distances from a point to two fixed points is always at least the distance between those two fixed points. So, in this case, the distance between 1 and 3 is 2. So, |x - 1| + |x - 3| is always greater than or equal to 2. That makes sense because if you pick any x, the total distance to 1 and 3 can't be less than the direct distance between 1 and 3.So, if the inequality |x - 1| + |x - 3| < m has a solution, that means m has to be greater than 2. Because if m were 2 or less, the inequality would never hold since the left side is always at least 2. So, condition p simplifies to m > 2.Now, moving on to condition q. It says that f(x) = (7 - 3m)^x is a decreasing function. Okay, I need to recall what makes an exponential function decreasing. I remember that for an exponential function a^x, if the base a is between 0 and 1, the function is decreasing. If a is greater than 1, it's increasing. Also, if a is equal to 1, it's a constant function.So, for f(x) to be decreasing, the base (7 - 3m) must satisfy 0 < 7 - 3m < 1. Let me write that down:0 < 7 - 3m < 1I need to solve this inequality for m. Let's break it into two parts.First, 7 - 3m > 0:7 - 3m > 0  Subtract 7 from both sides:  -3m > -7  Divide both sides by -3, remembering to flip the inequality sign:  m < 7/3Second, 7 - 3m < 1:7 - 3m < 1  Subtract 7 from both sides:  -3m < -6  Divide both sides by -3, flipping the inequality sign:  m > 2So, combining both inequalities, we have:2 < m < 7/3So, condition q holds when m is between 2 and 7/3.Now, let's compare conditions p and q. Condition p is m > 2, and condition q is 2 < m < 7/3.So, if q holds, then p must hold because if m is between 2 and 7/3, then m is definitely greater than 2. Therefore, p is a necessary condition for q. But is p sufficient for q? Well, p says m > 2, but q requires m to be less than 7/3 as well. So, if m is greater than 7/3, p is still true, but q is not. Therefore, p alone isn't enough to guarantee q. It's necessary but not sufficient.Let me think if I missed anything. For condition p, we concluded m > 2 because the sum of absolute values is at least 2. For condition q, we found that m needs to be between 2 and 7/3 for the function to be decreasing. So, p is broader; it includes more values of m than q. Therefore, p is necessary for q because q can't happen without p, but p isn't sufficient because p doesn't cover the upper bound required for q.Yeah, that seems right. So, p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for q.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"The hyperbolas [frac{y^2}{49} - frac{x^2}{25} = 1]and[frac{x^2}{T} - frac{y^2}{18} = 1]have the same asymptotes.

Therefore, the asymptotes are:[y = pm frac{7}{5} x]For the second hyperbola, which is of the form (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), the asymptotes are given by:[y = pm frac{b}{a} x]Here, ( a^2 = T ) so ( a = sqrt{T} ) and ( b^2 = 18 ) so ( b = sqrt{18} ).

The inequality is:left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 right) left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i right) - sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 geq 6 prod_{i=1}^n a_iAnd it needs to hold for any n positive numbers a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ..., a‚Çô. I need to find all positive integers n for which this is true.Hmm, let me start by understanding the components of this inequality. On the left side, we have two sums multiplied together and then subtracting another sum. On the right side, it's six times the product of all the a_i's.Maybe I can simplify the left side first. Let's write it out:left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 right) left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i right) - sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3If I expand the first product, it would be:sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 cdot sum_{j=1}^n a_j = sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=1}^n a_i^2 a_jWhich is:sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 + sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_jSo when we subtract the sum of a_i¬≥, we get:sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_jTherefore, the inequality simplifies to:sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_j geq 6 prod_{i=1}^n a_iOkay, so now the inequality is:sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_j geq 6 prod_{i=1}^n a_iI need this to hold for any positive a_i's. So, perhaps I can analyze this for small values of n and see if it's true or not.Let's start with n=1.**Case n=1:**Then, the left side is:sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_jBut since n=1, there are no i ‚â† j, so the sum is 0. The right side is 6 times the product, which is 6a‚ÇÅ. So the inequality becomes:0 ‚â• 6a‚ÇÅBut a‚ÇÅ is positive, so this is impossible. Therefore, n=1 does not satisfy the inequality.**Case n=2:**Now, n=2. Let's write out the left side:sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_j = a_1^2 a_2 + a_2^2 a_1So the inequality is:a_1^2 a_2 + a_2^2 a_1 geq 6 a_1 a_2We can factor out a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ:a_1 a_2 (a_1 + a_2) geq 6 a_1 a_2Since a‚ÇÅ and a‚ÇÇ are positive, we can divide both sides by a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ:a_1 + a_2 geq 6But this isn't necessarily true for all positive a‚ÇÅ and a‚ÇÇ. For example, if a‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÇ = 1, then 1 + 1 = 2 < 6, which violates the inequality. So n=2 doesn't work either.**Case n=3:**Now, n=3. Let's compute the left side:sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_j = a_1^2 a_2 + a_1^2 a_3 + a_2^2 a_1 + a_2^2 a_3 + a_3^2 a_1 + a_3^2 a_2So the inequality becomes:a_1^2 a_2 + a_1^2 a_3 + a_2^2 a_1 + a_2^2 a_3 + a_3^2 a_1 + a_3^2 a_2 geq 6 a_1 a_2 a_3Hmm, this looks familiar. Maybe I can apply the AM-GM inequality here. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.Looking at the left side, we have six terms, each of which is a product of two variables squared and one variable to the first power. Let's see:Each term is of the form a_i¬≤ a_j, where i ‚â† j. There are six such terms for n=3.So, applying AM-GM to these six terms:frac{a_1^2 a_2 + a_1^2 a_3 + a_2^2 a_1 + a_2^2 a_3 + a_3^2 a_1 + a_3^2 a_2}{6} geq sqrt[6]{(a_1^2 a_2)(a_1^2 a_3)(a_2^2 a_1)(a_2^2 a_3)(a_3^2 a_1)(a_3^2 a_2)}Let me compute the geometric mean on the right side. Multiply all the terms:Each a‚ÇÅ appears in the terms: a‚ÇÅ¬≤ a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÅ¬≤ a‚ÇÉ, a‚ÇÇ¬≤ a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÉ¬≤ a‚ÇÅ. So in total, a‚ÇÅ is squared twice and appears once in two other terms. Wait, let me count exponents:For a‚ÇÅ: in a‚ÇÅ¬≤ a‚ÇÇ, exponent is 2; in a‚ÇÅ¬≤ a‚ÇÉ, exponent is 2; in a‚ÇÇ¬≤ a‚ÇÅ, exponent is 1; in a‚ÇÉ¬≤ a‚ÇÅ, exponent is 1. So total exponent for a‚ÇÅ is 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.Similarly, for a‚ÇÇ: in a‚ÇÅ¬≤ a‚ÇÇ, exponent is 1; in a‚ÇÇ¬≤ a‚ÇÅ, exponent is 2; in a‚ÇÇ¬≤ a‚ÇÉ, exponent is 2; in a‚ÇÉ¬≤ a‚ÇÇ, exponent is 1. So total exponent for a‚ÇÇ is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6.Same for a‚ÇÉ: in a‚ÇÅ¬≤ a‚ÇÉ, exponent is 1; in a‚ÇÇ¬≤ a‚ÇÉ, exponent is 1; in a‚ÇÉ¬≤ a‚ÇÅ, exponent is 2; in a‚ÇÉ¬≤ a‚ÇÇ, exponent is 2. So total exponent for a‚ÇÉ is 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.Therefore, the product inside the root is:(a_1^6 a_2^6 a_3^6) = (a_1 a_2 a_3)^6So the geometric mean is:sqrt[6]{(a_1 a_2 a_3)^6} = a_1 a_2 a_3Therefore, the AM-GM inequality gives:frac{text{Left Side}}{6} geq a_1 a_2 a_3Multiplying both sides by 6:text{Left Side} geq 6 a_1 a_2 a_3Which is exactly the inequality we have for n=3. So the inequality holds for n=3.**Case n=4:**Now, let's check n=4. Maybe the same approach works, but let's see.The left side is:sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_jFor n=4, this sum has 4*3=12 terms, since for each i, there are 3 j's.So, the inequality is:sum_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_j geq 6 a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4Hmm, let's try applying AM-GM here. The left side has 12 terms, each of which is a product of two variables squared and one variable to the first power.Wait, but the right side is 6 times the product of all four variables. So, maybe I can see if the AM-GM inequality can give me something similar.But let's think about it. If I apply AM-GM to the 12 terms on the left, the geometric mean would be the 12th root of the product of all 12 terms.But each term is a_i¬≤ a_j, so the product would be:prod_{i neq j} a_i^2 a_jBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead of applying AM-GM directly, I can test specific values to see if the inequality holds.Let me try setting all a_i equal. Let a‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÇ = a‚ÇÉ = a‚ÇÑ = a.Then the left side becomes:sum_{i neq j} a^2 a = sum_{i neq j} a^3There are 12 terms, so it's 12a¬≥.The right side is 6a‚Å¥.So the inequality becomes:12a¬≥ ‚â• 6a‚Å¥Divide both sides by 6a¬≥ (since a > 0):2 ‚â• aSo, if a ‚â§ 2, the inequality holds. But if a > 2, it doesn't. Since the inequality needs to hold for any positive a_i, including when a > 2, n=4 doesn't satisfy the inequality.Alternatively, maybe I can choose specific values where the inequality fails. For example, let a‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÇ = a‚ÇÉ = a‚ÇÑ = 3.Then left side is 12*(3¬≥) = 12*27 = 324Right side is 6*(3‚Å¥) = 6*81 = 486So 324 < 486, which violates the inequality. Therefore, n=4 doesn't work.**Case n=5 and above:**Similarly, for n=5, if I set all a_i equal to some a, the left side would be n(n-1)a¬≥, and the right side would be 6a‚Åø.So the inequality becomes:n(n-1)a¬≥ ‚â• 6a‚ÅøDivide both sides by a¬≥:n(n-1) ‚â• 6a‚Åø‚Åª¬≥Now, if n > 3, then n-3 is positive. So, for a large enough a, the right side can be made larger than the left side, which is a constant. Therefore, the inequality won't hold for all positive a_i when n > 3.For example, take n=4 again. If a=3, as before, 4*3=12 on the left, and 6*3^(4-3)=6*3=18 on the right. 12 < 18, so it fails.Similarly, for n=5, if a=2, left side is 5*4=20, right side is 6*2^(5-3)=6*4=24. 20 < 24, so it fails.Therefore, for n ‚â• 4, the inequality doesn't hold for all positive a_i.**Conclusion:**From the above analysis, the inequality holds for n=3 but fails for n=1, n=2, and n ‚â•4. Therefore, the only positive integer n that satisfies the inequality for any positive numbers a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ..., a‚Çô is n=3.**Final Answer**The only positive integer ( n ) that satisfies the inequality is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Alice is bored in class, so she thinks of a positive integer. Every second after that, she subtracts from her current number its smallest prime divisor, possibly itself. After 2022 seconds, she realizes that her number is prime. Find the sum of all possible values of her initial number.","answer":"Okay, so Alice is thinking of a positive integer, and every second she subtracts the smallest prime divisor from her current number. After 2022 seconds, she ends up with a prime number. I need to find all possible initial numbers she could have started with and then sum them up.First, let me try to understand the process. If Alice starts with a number ( n ), each second she subtracts its smallest prime divisor. So, if ( n ) is even, the smallest prime divisor is 2, and she subtracts 2 each time. If ( n ) is odd, the smallest prime divisor could be 3, 5, 7, etc., depending on the number.After 2022 seconds, the number becomes prime. Let's denote this prime number as ( p ). So, starting from ( n ), after 2022 subtractions, we reach ( p ).Maybe it's easier to think backwards. If after 2022 seconds the number is ( p ), then one second before that, the number must have been ( p + d ), where ( d ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( p + d ). Since ( p ) is prime, its smallest prime divisor is itself. But wait, if we're going backwards, the previous number would have been ( p + d ), where ( d ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( p + d ).Hmm, this might get complicated. Let me consider specific cases.Case 1: Suppose ( p = 2 ). Then, one second before, the number was ( 2 + 2 = 4 ). The smallest prime divisor of 4 is 2, so subtracting 2 gives 2. Then, two seconds before, the number was ( 4 + 2 = 6 ). Similarly, each step before that would be adding 2, because the smallest prime divisor of an even number is 2. So, going back 2022 steps, the initial number would be ( 2 + 2 times 2022 = 4046 ).Case 2: Suppose ( p ) is an odd prime, say 3. Then, one second before, the number was ( 3 + d ), where ( d ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( 3 + d ). If ( d = 2 ), then the previous number was ( 3 + 2 = 5 ). The smallest prime divisor of 5 is 5, so subtracting 5 would give 0, which is not possible because we need a positive integer. So, this path doesn't work.Alternatively, if ( d = 3 ), then the previous number was ( 3 + 3 = 6 ). The smallest prime divisor of 6 is 2, so subtracting 2 gives 4, not 3. So, this doesn't work either.Wait, maybe if ( p ) is an odd prime, the previous number must be even because the smallest prime divisor would be 2. So, if ( p ) is odd, the number before that would have been ( p + 2 ). But then, the number before that would be ( p + 2 + 2 = p + 4 ), and so on. However, this would mean that all previous numbers are even, and subtracting 2 each time would lead to ( p ) being even, which contradicts ( p ) being an odd prime.Therefore, the only possible prime ( p ) after 2022 seconds is 2. So, the initial number must be ( 2 + 2 times 2022 = 4046 ).But wait, could there be another initial number? Let me think. If the initial number was odd, say ( n ), then the first subtraction would be its smallest prime divisor, which is odd. So, subtracting an odd number from an odd number gives an even number. Then, all subsequent subtractions would be 2, since the number is even. So, after the first subtraction, the number becomes even, and then we subtract 2 each time.So, if the initial number is odd, after one second, it becomes even, and then we subtract 2 for the remaining 2021 seconds. Therefore, the total subtraction would be the smallest prime divisor of ( n ) plus ( 2 times 2021 ). Since after 2022 seconds, the number is prime, which is 2.So, let's denote the initial number as ( n ). After one second, it becomes ( n - d ), where ( d ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( n ). Then, for the next 2021 seconds, we subtract 2 each time, so the number becomes ( (n - d) - 2 times 2021 = 2 ).Therefore, ( n - d - 4042 = 2 ), which implies ( n - d = 4044 ). So, ( n = 4044 + d ).Since ( d ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( n ), and ( n ) is odd (because if ( n ) were even, ( d ) would be 2, and we would have already considered that case). So, ( d ) must be an odd prime.Also, ( n = 4044 + d ) must be odd, so ( 4044 ) is even, so ( d ) must be odd to make ( n ) odd.Therefore, ( d ) is an odd prime divisor of ( n = 4044 + d ).So, ( d ) divides ( 4044 + d ). Therefore, ( d ) divides ( 4044 ).Because ( d ) divides ( 4044 + d ), which implies ( d ) divides ( 4044 ).So, ( d ) is an odd prime divisor of 4044.Let's factorize 4044.4044 divided by 2 is 2022.2022 divided by 2 is 1011.1011 divided by 3 is 337.337 is a prime number.So, the prime factors of 4044 are 2, 3, and 337.Since ( d ) is an odd prime divisor, ( d ) can be 3 or 337.Therefore, possible values of ( d ) are 3 and 337.Thus, possible values of ( n ) are:- If ( d = 3 ), then ( n = 4044 + 3 = 4047 ).- If ( d = 337 ), then ( n = 4044 + 337 = 4381 ).Wait, but 4381? Let me check if 337 is indeed the smallest prime divisor of 4381.4381 divided by 337 is 13. So, 4381 = 337 √ó 13.So, the prime factors are 13 and 337. The smallest prime divisor is 13, not 337. Therefore, ( d ) should be 13, not 337.Wait, this is a problem. Because if ( n = 4381 ), then its smallest prime divisor is 13, not 337. So, my earlier assumption was wrong.Therefore, ( d ) must be the smallest prime divisor of ( n = 4044 + d ). So, ( d ) must be the smallest prime divisor of ( 4044 + d ).Given that ( d ) is an odd prime divisor of 4044, which are 3 and 337. But when ( d = 337 ), ( n = 4044 + 337 = 4381 ), whose smallest prime divisor is 13, not 337. Therefore, ( d ) cannot be 337 because it's not the smallest prime divisor of ( n ).Therefore, the only valid ( d ) is 3.So, ( n = 4044 + 3 = 4047 ).Therefore, the possible initial numbers are 4046 and 4047.Wait, earlier I thought 4046 is the only one, but now considering the case where the initial number is odd, we get 4047 as another possibility.Therefore, the sum of all possible initial numbers is 4046 + 4047 = 8093.But let me verify this.For ( n = 4046 ):- It's even, so smallest prime divisor is 2.- Subtracting 2 each time for 2022 seconds gives 4046 - 2√ó2022 = 4046 - 4044 = 2, which is prime.For ( n = 4047 ):- It's odd, so smallest prime divisor is 3.- Subtracting 3 gives 4047 - 3 = 4044.- Now, 4044 is even, so smallest prime divisor is 2.- Subtracting 2 each time for the remaining 2021 seconds gives 4044 - 2√ó2021 = 4044 - 4042 = 2, which is prime.Therefore, both 4046 and 4047 are valid initial numbers.Are there any other possibilities?Suppose ( d ) is another prime divisor of 4044, but we saw that 337 doesn't work because it's not the smallest prime divisor of ( n ). What about 2? If ( d = 2 ), then ( n = 4044 + 2 = 4046 ), which we already considered.Therefore, the only possible initial numbers are 4046 and 4047, and their sum is 8093."},{"question":"Billy buys a 12 pack of soda from the store.

Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.First, I know that if ( (x + y)^{19} - x^{19} - y^{19} ) is a multiple of ( p ), then it must be congruent to 0 modulo ( p ). So, I can write this as:[(x + y)^{19} equiv x^{19} + y^{19} pmod{p}]for all positive integers ( x ) and ( y ).Now, I remember something about Fermat's Little Theorem, which says that for a prime ( p ), and any integer ( a ) not divisible by ( p ), we have:[a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}]Which also implies that:[a^p equiv a pmod{p}]So, if I can relate the exponent 19 to ( p-1 ), maybe that can help me find the primes ( p ) that satisfy the condition.Let me think. If ( p ) is a prime such that ( 19 equiv 1 pmod{p-1} ), then ( a^{19} equiv a pmod{p} ) for any integer ( a ). That would mean:[(x + y)^{19} equiv (x + y) pmod{p}]and[x^{19} equiv x pmod{p}, quad y^{19} equiv y pmod{p}]So, substituting back into the original expression:[(x + y) equiv x + y pmod{p}]Which is obviously true. Therefore, if ( 19 equiv 1 pmod{p-1} ), then the condition holds. So, ( p-1 ) must divide ( 19 - 1 = 18 ). That means ( p-1 ) is a divisor of 18.The divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Therefore, ( p ) could be 2, 3, 7, 19, or 19 again? Wait, let's list them properly:- If ( p-1 = 1 ), then ( p = 2 )- If ( p-1 = 2 ), then ( p = 3 )- If ( p-1 = 3 ), then ( p = 4 ) (but 4 is not prime)- If ( p-1 = 6 ), then ( p = 7 )- If ( p-1 = 9 ), then ( p = 10 ) (not prime)- If ( p-1 = 18 ), then ( p = 19 )So, the primes we get are 2, 3, 7, and 19.Wait, but I should verify if these primes actually satisfy the condition. Let me check each one.Starting with ( p = 2 ):- For any ( x ) and ( y ), ( (x + y)^{19} ) modulo 2 is the same as ( (x + y) ) modulo 2 because any number to the power of 19 is congruent to itself modulo 2. Similarly, ( x^{19} equiv x pmod{2} ) and ( y^{19} equiv y pmod{2} ). So, ( (x + y) - x - y equiv 0 pmod{2} ). That works.Next, ( p = 3 ):- By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( a^3 equiv a pmod{3} ). So, ( a^{19} = (a^3)^6 cdot a equiv a^6 cdot a equiv (a)^2 cdot a = a^3 equiv a pmod{3} ). So, same logic as above, ( (x + y)^{19} - x^{19} - y^{19} equiv (x + y) - x - y equiv 0 pmod{3} ). That works too.Now, ( p = 7 ):- Fermat's Little Theorem tells us ( a^7 equiv a pmod{7} ). So, ( a^{19} = (a^7)^2 cdot a^5 equiv a^2 cdot a^5 = a^7 equiv a pmod{7} ). Therefore, again, ( (x + y)^{19} - x^{19} - y^{19} equiv (x + y) - x - y equiv 0 pmod{7} ). Perfect.Lastly, ( p = 19 ):- Here, ( a^{19} equiv a pmod{19} ) by Fermat's Little Theorem since ( 19 ) is prime. So, ( (x + y)^{19} - x^{19} - y^{19} equiv (x + y) - x - y equiv 0 pmod{19} ). That works as well.So, all four primes 2, 3, 7, and 19 satisfy the condition. But wait, I should check if there are any other primes that might work, just to be thorough.Let me think about another prime, say ( p = 5 ). Does it satisfy the condition?For ( p = 5 ), ( a^5 equiv a pmod{5} ). So, ( a^{19} = (a^5)^3 cdot a^4 equiv a^3 cdot a^4 = a^7 ). But ( a^7 ) modulo 5 isn't necessarily equal to ( a ). Let me test with ( a = 2 ):- ( 2^{19} ) modulo 5. Since ( 2^4 = 16 equiv 1 pmod{5} ), so ( 2^{19} = 2^{4*4 + 3} = (2^4)^4 * 2^3 equiv 1^4 * 8 equiv 8 equiv 3 pmod{5} ). But ( 2 ) modulo 5 is 2, so ( 2^{19} equiv 3 notequiv 2 pmod{5} ). Therefore, ( (x + y)^{19} - x^{19} - y^{19} ) isn't necessarily 0 modulo 5. So, 5 doesn't work.Similarly, let's check ( p = 13 ). ( a^{13} equiv a pmod{13} ). So, ( a^{19} = a^{13} cdot a^6 equiv a cdot a^6 = a^7 pmod{13} ). Let me test ( a = 2 ):- ( 2^{19} ) modulo 13. Since ( 2^{12} equiv 1 pmod{13} ), ( 2^{19} = 2^{12} cdot 2^7 equiv 1 * 128 equiv 128 - 9*13 = 128 - 117 = 11 pmod{13} ). But ( 2 ) modulo 13 is 2, so ( 2^{19} equiv 11 notequiv 2 pmod{13} ). Thus, 13 doesn't work.How about ( p = 73 )? Wait, 73 is a prime, but let me see. ( a^{73} equiv a pmod{73} ). So, ( a^{19} ) modulo 73. Hmm, 19 is less than 73, so unless 19 is congruent to 1 modulo 72 (since 73-1=72), which it isn't because 19-1=18, which doesn't divide 72. Wait, 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 18 divides 72. Hmm, maybe 73 could work? Let me test with specific numbers.Let me take ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 1 ). Then, ( (2 + 1)^{19} - 2^{19} - 1^{19} = 3^{19} - 2^{19} - 1 ). Let me compute this modulo 73.First, compute ( 3^{19} ) modulo 73. Since 73 is prime, ( 3^{72} equiv 1 pmod{73} ). Let's find the exponent 19 modulo 72. 19 is less than 72, so we can compute ( 3^{19} ) directly or find a pattern.Alternatively, let me compute powers of 3 modulo 73:- ( 3^1 = 3 )- ( 3^2 = 9 )- ( 3^3 = 27 )- ( 3^4 = 81 equiv 8 pmod{73} )- ( 3^5 = 3 * 8 = 24 )- ( 3^6 = 3 * 24 = 72 equiv -1 pmod{73} )- ( 3^7 = 3 * (-1) = -3 equiv 70 pmod{73} )- ( 3^8 = 3 * 70 = 210 equiv 210 - 2*73 = 210 - 146 = 64 pmod{73} )- ( 3^9 = 3 * 64 = 192 equiv 192 - 2*73 = 192 - 146 = 46 pmod{73} )- ( 3^{10} = 3 * 46 = 138 equiv 138 - 1*73 = 65 pmod{73} )- ( 3^{11} = 3 * 65 = 195 equiv 195 - 2*73 = 195 - 146 = 49 pmod{73} )- ( 3^{12} = 3 * 49 = 147 equiv 147 - 2*73 = 147 - 146 = 1 pmod{73} )- ( 3^{12} equiv 1 pmod{73} ), so ( 3^{19} = 3^{12} * 3^7 equiv 1 * 70 equiv 70 pmod{73} )Now, compute ( 2^{19} ) modulo 73. Similarly, let's find a pattern:- ( 2^1 = 2 )- ( 2^2 = 4 )- ( 2^3 = 8 )- ( 2^4 = 16 )- ( 2^5 = 32 )- ( 2^6 = 64 )- ( 2^7 = 128 equiv 128 - 73 = 55 pmod{73} )- ( 2^8 = 2 * 55 = 110 equiv 110 - 73 = 37 pmod{73} )- ( 2^9 = 2 * 37 = 74 equiv 1 pmod{73} )- ( 2^9 equiv 1 pmod{73} ), so ( 2^{19} = 2^{9*2 + 1} = (2^9)^2 * 2^1 equiv 1^2 * 2 equiv 2 pmod{73} )So, putting it all together:[3^{19} - 2^{19} - 1 equiv 70 - 2 - 1 = 67 pmod{73}]67 is not congruent to 0 modulo 73, so ( p = 73 ) does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, 73 is out.I think I've checked all possible primes that could satisfy ( p-1 ) dividing 18, and only 2, 3, 7, and 19 work. Let me just recap:- For ( p = 2 ): ( 19 equiv 1 pmod{1} ) (since ( p-1 = 1 )), works.- For ( p = 3 ): ( 19 equiv 1 pmod{2} ), works.- For ( p = 7 ): ( 19 equiv 1 pmod{6} ), works.- For ( p = 19 ): ( 19 equiv 1 pmod{18} ), works.And others like 5, 13, 73 don't work as shown by testing specific cases.So, I think I've covered all possibilities. The primes are 2, 3, 7, and 19."},{"question":"Find the standard equations that meet the following conditions:(1) The focus is on the x-axis, has the same eccentricity as the ellipse frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{3} = 1, and passes through the point (2, -sqrt{3});(2) The focus is on the x-axis, the distance between the vertices is 6, and the asymptotes are y = pm frac{1}{3}x of the hyperbola.","answer":"Okay, so I have two problems to solve here, both related to conic sections. Let me take them one by one.Starting with problem (1): I need to find the standard equation of an ellipse. The conditions are that the focus is on the x-axis, it has the same eccentricity as the given ellipse (frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1), and it passes through the point ((2, -sqrt{3})).First, let me recall what the standard form of an ellipse is. If the major axis is along the x-axis, the standard equation is (frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), where (a > b). The eccentricity (e) of an ellipse is given by (e = frac{c}{a}), where (c) is the distance from the center to each focus, and (c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}).Given the ellipse (frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1), I can see that (a^2 = 4) and (b^2 = 3), so (a = 2) and (b = sqrt{3}). The eccentricity (e) is then (e = frac{sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}{a} = frac{sqrt{4 - 3}}{2} = frac{1}{2}).So, the ellipse we're looking for must have the same eccentricity, (e = frac{1}{2}), and its focus is on the x-axis. Since the focus is on the x-axis, the major axis must be along the x-axis, so the standard form will be (frac{x^2}{A^2} + frac{y^2}{B^2} = 1), where (A > B).Let me denote the new ellipse as (frac{x^2}{A^2} + frac{y^2}{B^2} = 1). Its eccentricity is also (e = frac{1}{2}), so (e = frac{C}{A} = frac{1}{2}), where (C) is the distance from the center to each focus. Therefore, (C = frac{A}{2}).Also, for an ellipse, (C^2 = A^2 - B^2). Plugging in (C = frac{A}{2}), we get (left(frac{A}{2}right)^2 = A^2 - B^2), which simplifies to (frac{A^2}{4} = A^2 - B^2). Rearranging, (B^2 = A^2 - frac{A^2}{4} = frac{3A^2}{4}).So, the equation of the ellipse becomes (frac{x^2}{A^2} + frac{y^2}{frac{3A^2}{4}} = 1), which can be written as (frac{x^2}{A^2} + frac{4y^2}{3A^2} = 1).Now, this ellipse passes through the point ((2, -sqrt{3})). Let's plug this point into the equation:[frac{2^2}{A^2} + frac{4(-sqrt{3})^2}{3A^2} = 1]Simplifying:[frac{4}{A^2} + frac{4 times 3}{3A^2} = 1][frac{4}{A^2} + frac{12}{3A^2} = 1][frac{4}{A^2} + frac{4}{A^2} = 1][frac{8}{A^2} = 1][A^2 = 8][A = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}]So, (A^2 = 8) and (B^2 = frac{3A^2}{4} = frac{24}{4} = 6). Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is:[frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{6} = 1]Alright, that seems to satisfy all the given conditions. Let me just double-check by plugging in the point ((2, -sqrt{3})):[frac{2^2}{8} + frac{(-sqrt{3})^2}{6} = frac{4}{8} + frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1]Yes, that works. So, problem (1) is solved.Moving on to problem (2): I need to find the standard equation of a hyperbola. The conditions are that the focus is on the x-axis, the distance between the vertices is 6, and the asymptotes are (y = pm frac{1}{3}x).First, let me recall the standard form of a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis (since the focus is on the x-axis). The standard equation is (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), where (a) is the distance from the center to each vertex, and (b) is related to the conjugate axis.The distance between the vertices is given as 6. Since the vertices are located at ((pm a, 0)), the distance between them is (2a). So, (2a = 6) implies (a = 3).Next, the asymptotes of a hyperbola are given by (y = pm frac{b}{a}x). Here, the asymptotes are (y = pm frac{1}{3}x). Therefore, (frac{b}{a} = frac{1}{3}).Since we already found (a = 3), plugging into (frac{b}{a} = frac{1}{3}), we get:[frac{b}{3} = frac{1}{3} implies b = 1]So, (a = 3) and (b = 1). Therefore, the standard equation of the hyperbola is:[frac{x^2}{3^2} - frac{y^2}{1^2} = 1 implies frac{x^2}{9} - y^2 = 1]Let me just verify the asymptotes. The asymptotes should be (y = pm frac{b}{a}x = pm frac{1}{3}x), which matches the given condition. Also, the distance between the vertices is (2a = 6), which is correct. So, problem (2) is solved.In summary, for problem (1), the ellipse equation is (frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{6} = 1), and for problem (2), the hyperbola equation is (frac{x^2}{9} - y^2 = 1).**Final Answer**(1) The standard equation of the ellipse is (boxed{dfrac{x^2}{8} + dfrac{y^2}{6} = 1}).(2) The standard equation of the hyperbola is (boxed{dfrac{x^2}{9} - y^2 = 1})."},{"question":"Find all functions ( f: mathbf{Q}_{+} rightarrow mathbf{Q}_{+} ) such that for all ( x, y in mathbf{Q}_{+} ), the following equation holds:fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right)=f^{2}(x) f(y) .","answer":"Okay, so I have this functional equation to solve: ( fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right) = f^{2}(x) f(y) ) where ( f: mathbf{Q}_{+} rightarrow mathbf{Q}_{+} ). Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I should recall what functional equations are. They are equations where the unknown is a function, and we have to find all functions that satisfy the given condition. In this case, the function ( f ) takes positive rational numbers to positive rational numbers.Looking at the equation ( fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right) = f^{2}(x) f(y) ), I notice that both sides involve compositions of ( f ) with other functions. Maybe I can find some substitutions for ( x ) or ( y ) that simplify the equation.Let me try plugging in specific values for ( x ) or ( y ) to see if I can get more information about ( f ).What if I set ( x = 1 )? Then the equation becomes:[ fleft(1^{2} f^{2}(y)right) = f^{2}(1) f(y) ]Simplifying, that's:[ fleft(f^{2}(y)right) = f^{2}(1) f(y) ]Let me denote ( c = f(1) ). Then this equation becomes:[ fleft(f^{2}(y)right) = c^{2} f(y) ]Hmm, interesting. So ( f ) composed with ( f^{2} ) is just a scalar multiple of ( f ). Maybe this suggests that ( f ) is multiplicative or something?Alternatively, maybe I can assume that ( f ) is a constant function. Let's test that. Suppose ( f(x) = k ) for some constant ( k in mathbf{Q}_{+} ). Then substituting into the original equation:[ fleft(x^{2} k^{2}right) = k^{2} k ]Which simplifies to:[ k = k^{3} ]So ( k^{3} - k = 0 ), which factors as ( k(k^{2} - 1) = 0 ). Therefore, ( k = 0 ), ( k = 1 ), or ( k = -1 ). But since ( f ) maps to positive rationals, ( k ) must be positive. So ( k = 1 ).So ( f(x) = 1 ) is a constant solution. But is it the only solution? I need to check if there are other possible functions.Let me see if I can find another substitution. Maybe set ( y = 1 ). Then the original equation becomes:[ fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(1)right) = f^{2}(x) f(1) ]Again, since ( f(1) = c ), this is:[ fleft(x^{2} c^{2}right) = f^{2}(x) c ]Hmm, if I let ( x = 1 ) here, I get:[ f(c^{2}) = c^{2} c = c^{3} ]But earlier, when I set ( x = 1 ), I had ( f(f^{2}(y)) = c^{2} f(y) ). If I set ( y = 1 ) there, I get:[ f(f^{2}(1)) = c^{2} f(1) ]Which is:[ f(c^{2}) = c^{3} ]Which matches the previous result. So that doesn't give me new information.Maybe I can consider if ( f ) is injective or surjective. If ( f ) is injective, then maybe I can manipulate the equation to find more properties.Suppose ( f ) is injective. Then if ( f(a) = f(b) ), it must be that ( a = b ). Let me see if I can use this.Looking back at the original equation:[ fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right) = f^{2}(x) f(y) ]If I fix ( y ) and vary ( x ), or fix ( x ) and vary ( y ), maybe I can find some relationship.Alternatively, maybe I can take logarithms? Since ( f ) maps to positive rationals, taking logarithms might turn the multiplicative structure into additive, which could be easier. Let me try that.Let me define ( g(x) = ln(f(e^{x})) ). Wait, but we're dealing with ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ), which is under multiplication, not addition. Maybe another substitution.Alternatively, suppose I let ( x = y ). Then the equation becomes:[ fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(x)right) = f^{2}(x) f(x) = f^{3}(x) ]So:[ fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(x)right) = f^{3}(x) ]Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Wait, maybe I can consider the function ( f ) being multiplicative. Suppose ( f(ab) = f(a)f(b) ) for all ( a, b in mathbf{Q}_{+} ). If ( f ) is multiplicative, then perhaps I can substitute that into the equation.But I don't know if ( f ) is multiplicative yet. Let me test if the constant function ( f(x) = 1 ) is the only solution or if there are others.Suppose ( f ) is multiplicative. Then:Left-hand side: ( f(x^{2} f^{2}(y)) = f(x^{2}) f(f^{2}(y)) = f(x)^{2} f(f(y))^{2} )Right-hand side: ( f^{2}(x) f(y) = f(x)^{2} f(y) )So equating them:[ f(x)^{2} f(f(y))^{2} = f(x)^{2} f(y) ]Divide both sides by ( f(x)^{2} ) (since ( f(x) ) is positive, it's non-zero):[ f(f(y))^{2} = f(y) ]So ( f(f(y)) = sqrt{f(y)} ). But since ( f(y) ) is a positive rational, ( sqrt{f(y)} ) must also be rational. Therefore, ( f(y) ) must be a square of a rational number. But ( f(y) ) is already in ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ), so that's okay.But then, ( f(f(y)) = sqrt{f(y)} ). Let me denote ( z = f(y) ), so ( f(z) = sqrt{z} ). So ( f(z) = z^{1/2} ). But ( f ) maps ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ) to ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ). So ( z^{1/2} ) must be rational for all ( z in mathbf{Q}_{+} ). But that's only possible if ( z ) is a square of a rational, which is not true for all ( z in mathbf{Q}_{+} ). For example, ( z = 2 ) is not a square of a rational. Therefore, ( f(z) = z^{1/2} ) is not a valid function from ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ) to ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ).Therefore, assuming ( f ) is multiplicative leads to a contradiction unless ( f(y) = 1 ) for all ( y ), which is the constant function we found earlier.So maybe ( f ) is not multiplicative, but perhaps something else.Let me think about another approach. Maybe I can set ( x = f(y) ). Let's try that.Set ( x = f(y) ). Then the equation becomes:[ fleft(f(y)^{2} f^{2}(y)right) = f^{2}(f(y)) f(y) ]Simplify the left-hand side:[ fleft(f(y)^{4}right) ]And the right-hand side:[ f^{2}(f(y)) f(y) ]So:[ fleft(f(y)^{4}right) = f^{2}(f(y)) f(y) ]Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Wait, maybe I can iterate the function. Let me consider applying ( f ) multiple times.From earlier, when I set ( x = 1 ), I had:[ f(f^{2}(y)) = c^{2} f(y) ]Where ( c = f(1) ). So if I denote ( f^{n}(y) ) as the nth iterate of ( f ), then:[ f^{3}(y) = c^{2} f(y) ]Similarly, applying ( f ) again:[ f^{4}(y) = c^{2} f^{2}(y) ]And again:[ f^{5}(y) = c^{2} f^{3}(y) = c^{4} f(y) ]Hmm, so the iterates of ( f ) cycle with powers of ( c^{2} ). But unless ( c = 1 ), this might not lead to a consistent solution.If ( c = 1 ), then ( f^{3}(y) = f(y) ), so ( f^{3} = f ). That suggests that applying ( f ) three times is the same as applying it once. So ( f ) is an involution up to three applications.But since ( f ) maps ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ) to ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ), and if ( f^{3}(y) = f(y) ), then ( f ) is periodic with period 2 in some sense. But I'm not sure how that helps.Wait, if ( c = 1 ), then from the equation ( f(f^{2}(y)) = f(y) ), which is ( f^{3}(y) = f(y) ). So ( f^{3} = f ). So ( f ) is a function that when composed three times gives itself. That could mean that ( f ) is the identity function, but let's test that.Suppose ( f(x) = x ). Then substituting into the original equation:Left-hand side: ( f(x^{2} f^{2}(y)) = f(x^{2} y^{2}) = x^{2} y^{2} )Right-hand side: ( f^{2}(x) f(y) = x^{2} y )So ( x^{2} y^{2} = x^{2} y ) implies ( y^{2} = y ) for all ( y in mathbf{Q}_{+} ), which is only true if ( y = 1 ). So ( f(x) = x ) is not a solution unless ( y = 1 ), which isn't valid for all ( y ). Therefore, ( f(x) = x ) is not a solution.So ( f ) is not the identity function. Maybe it's a constant function. We already saw that ( f(x) = 1 ) works. Let me check if there are other constant functions. Suppose ( f(x) = k ), then as before:Left-hand side: ( f(x^{2} k^{2}) = k )Right-hand side: ( k^{2} k = k^{3} )So ( k = k^{3} ), which gives ( k = 0 ) or ( k = 1 ) or ( k = -1 ). But since ( f ) maps to positive rationals, ( k = 1 ) is the only solution. So ( f(x) = 1 ) is the only constant solution.But are there non-constant solutions? Let me see.Suppose ( f ) is not constant. Then there exist ( a, b in mathbf{Q}_{+} ) such that ( f(a) neq f(b) ). Let me see if I can derive some properties.From the original equation:[ fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right) = f^{2}(x) f(y) ]Let me fix ( y ) and consider this as a function of ( x ). Let me denote ( z = x^{2} f^{2}(y) ). Then ( x = sqrt{z / f^{2}(y)} ). So:[ f(z) = f^{2}left(sqrt{z / f^{2}(y)}right) f(y) ]Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can express ( f ) in terms of itself. Let me rearrange the equation:[ fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right) = f^{2}(x) f(y) ]Divide both sides by ( f(y) ) (since ( f(y) ) is positive, it's non-zero):[ frac{fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right)}{f(y)} = f^{2}(x) ]So:[ f^{2}(x) = frac{fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right)}{f(y)} ]This suggests that ( f^{2}(x) ) is equal to ( f ) evaluated at ( x^{2} f^{2}(y) ) divided by ( f(y) ). But this must hold for all ( y ), so the right-hand side must be independent of ( y ). That is, for all ( y ), ( frac{fleft(x^{2} f^{2}(y)right)}{f(y)} ) is the same.Let me denote ( w = f(y) ). Then the equation becomes:[ frac{f(x^{2} w^{2})}{w} = f^{2}(x) ]So for all ( w in mathbf{Q}_{+} ), ( f(x^{2} w^{2}) = w f^{2}(x) )Hmm, that's interesting. So for any ( w ), ( f(x^{2} w^{2}) = w f^{2}(x) ). Let me see if I can express ( f ) in terms of ( x ) and ( w ).Let me fix ( x ) and vary ( w ). Let me set ( t = w^{2} ), so ( w = sqrt{t} ). Then:[ f(x^{2} t) = sqrt{t} f^{2}(x) ]So:[ f(x^{2} t) = sqrt{t} f^{2}(x) ]Let me denote ( u = x^{2} t ), so ( t = u / x^{2} ). Then:[ f(u) = sqrt{u / x^{2}} f^{2}(x) = frac{sqrt{u}}{x} f^{2}(x) ]So:[ f(u) = frac{f^{2}(x)}{x} sqrt{u} ]But this must hold for all ( u ) and ( x ). Let me see if this suggests a form for ( f ).Let me denote ( k(x) = frac{f^{2}(x)}{x} ). Then:[ f(u) = k(x) sqrt{u} ]But ( k(x) ) depends on ( x ), while the left-hand side ( f(u) ) depends only on ( u ). Therefore, ( k(x) ) must be a constant function. Let me denote ( k(x) = c ), a constant.So:[ f(u) = c sqrt{u} ]But ( f(u) ) must map ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ) to ( mathbf{Q}_{+} ). So ( c sqrt{u} ) must be rational for all ( u in mathbf{Q}_{+} ). But ( sqrt{u} ) is rational only if ( u ) is a square of a rational. However, ( u ) can be any positive rational, not necessarily a square. Therefore, unless ( c = 0 ), which is not allowed since ( f ) maps to positive rationals, this is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that ( c = 0 ), but that contradicts ( f ) mapping to positive rationals.Wait, but earlier we found that ( f(x) = 1 ) is a solution. How does that fit into this?If ( f(x) = 1 ), then ( f(u) = 1 ), and from the equation ( f(u) = c sqrt{u} ), we have ( 1 = c sqrt{u} ) for all ( u ). But that's only possible if ( c = 0 ), which is a contradiction. So perhaps my assumption that ( f ) is non-constant leads to a contradiction, meaning that the only solution is the constant function ( f(x) = 1 ).Wait, but earlier when I tried assuming ( f ) is multiplicative, I got ( f(f(y)) = sqrt{f(y)} ), which led to a contradiction unless ( f(y) = 1 ). So maybe the only solution is indeed the constant function ( f(x) = 1 ).Let me verify this again. If ( f(x) = 1 ), then substituting into the original equation:Left-hand side: ( f(x^{2} f^{2}(y)) = f(x^{2} cdot 1^{2}) = f(x^{2}) = 1 )Right-hand side: ( f^{2}(x) f(y) = 1^{2} cdot 1 = 1 )So both sides are equal, which confirms that ( f(x) = 1 ) is indeed a solution.Are there any other possible solutions? From the above reasoning, it seems that assuming ( f ) is non-constant leads to contradictions, suggesting that ( f(x) = 1 ) is the only solution.Therefore, after considering various substitutions and properties, it appears that the only function ( f: mathbf{Q}_{+} rightarrow mathbf{Q}_{+} ) satisfying the given functional equation is the constant function ( f(x) = 1 )."},{"question":"For what positive value of t is |{-5+ti}| = 5sqrt{5}?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: For what positive value of ( t ) is ( |-5 + ti| = 5sqrt{5} ). Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number ( a + bi ) is calculated using the formula ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). So, in this case, the complex number is ( -5 + ti ). That means ( a = -5 ) and ( b = t ).So, applying the formula, the modulus should be ( sqrt{(-5)^2 + t^2} ). Let me compute that. ( (-5)^2 ) is 25, right? So, it becomes ( sqrt{25 + t^2} ).The problem says that this modulus equals ( 5sqrt{5} ). So, I can set up the equation:( sqrt{25 + t^2} = 5sqrt{5} )Now, to solve for ( t ), I need to get rid of the square root. I'll square both sides of the equation. Squaring the left side gives me ( 25 + t^2 ), and squaring the right side, ( (5sqrt{5})^2 ), which is ( 25 times 5 = 125 ).So now, the equation is:( 25 + t^2 = 125 )To solve for ( t^2 ), I'll subtract 25 from both sides:( t^2 = 125 - 25 )( t^2 = 100 )Now, to find ( t ), I take the square root of both sides. Since the problem asks for the positive value of ( t ), I'll take the positive square root:( t = sqrt{100} )( t = 10 )Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning, the modulus of ( -5 + ti ) is indeed ( sqrt{25 + t^2} ). Setting that equal to ( 5sqrt{5} ) and squaring both sides gives ( 25 + t^2 = 125 ). Subtracting 25 gives ( t^2 = 100 ), so ( t = 10 ). Yeah, that seems right.I guess another way to think about it is to visualize the complex number on the complex plane. The real part is -5, so it's 5 units to the left of the origin on the real axis, and the imaginary part is ( t ), so it's ( t ) units up on the imaginary axis. The modulus is the distance from the origin to the point (-5, t), which forms a right triangle with legs of length 5 and ( t ). The hypotenuse of this triangle is given as ( 5sqrt{5} ).Using the Pythagorean theorem, ( 5^2 + t^2 = (5sqrt{5})^2 ). Calculating that, ( 25 + t^2 = 125 ), so ( t^2 = 100 ), and ( t = 10 ). Yep, that matches what I got earlier.I think I'm confident that the positive value of ( t ) is 10. There doesn't seem to be any errors in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I think that's the answer."},{"question":"Jacob takes four tests in his physics class and earns 85, 79, 92 and 84. What must he earn on his fifth and final test to have an overall average of 85?","answer":"Okay, so Jacob has taken four tests in his physics class and got scores of 85, 79, 92, and 84. He wants to know what he needs to score on his fifth and final test to have an overall average of 85. Hmm, let's see how I can figure this out.First, I remember that an average is calculated by adding up all the scores and then dividing by the number of tests. So, if Jacob wants an average of 85 over five tests, I need to find out what total score he needs across all five tests.Let me write that down. The formula for the average is:[text{Average} = frac{text{Total Points}}{text{Number of Tests}}]So, if the average needs to be 85 over five tests, the total points he needs would be:[85 times 5 = 425]Okay, so Jacob needs a total of 425 points across all five tests. Now, I need to find out how many points he has already earned from the first four tests. Let's add those up:[85 + 79 + 92 + 84]Let me do the addition step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake. First, 85 plus 79 is 164. Then, 164 plus 92 is 256. Finally, 256 plus 84 is 340. So, Jacob has earned a total of 340 points from his first four tests.Now, to find out what he needs on the fifth test, I subtract the points he already has from the total points he needs:[425 - 340 = 85]So, Jacob needs to score 85 on his fifth test to have an overall average of 85.Wait a second, that seems a bit straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.Adding the first four test scores again:[85 + 79 = 164][164 + 92 = 256][256 + 84 = 340]Yes, that's correct. And the total needed is indeed 425. Subtracting 340 from 425 gives 85. So, my initial calculation seems right.I guess Jacob needs to score exactly 85 on his fifth test to achieve the desired average. That makes sense because if he scores higher than 85, his average will be more than 85, and if he scores lower, it will be less. Since he wants exactly 85, 85 is the required score.I wonder if there's another way to think about this problem. Maybe by considering how each test score affects the average. Let's see.The average after four tests is:[frac{340}{4} = 85]Oh, interesting! So, Jacob already has an average of 85 after four tests. That means if he scores 85 on his fifth test, his average will remain 85. That aligns with what I calculated earlier.This makes sense because if all his test scores are 85, his average will naturally stay at 85. So, in this case, since his current average is already 85, he just needs to maintain that score on his final test.I think I've got it. Jacob needs to score 85 on his fifth test to keep his overall average at 85."},{"question":"In triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are denoted as a, b, and c respectively. Given that a=3 and sin B = sin 2A. Find:<br/>‚ë† the value of frac{b}{cos A} is ____;<br/>‚ë° if a > c, then the range of values for b is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this triangle ABC, and the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively. I know that a is 3, and that sin B equals sin 2A. I need to find two things: first, the value of b divided by cos A, and second, if a is greater than c, what the range of values for b is.Alright, let's start with the first part. I remember that in a triangle, the Law of Sines relates the sides and angles: a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. Since I know a is 3, maybe I can use that.Given that sin B = sin 2A, I can use the double-angle identity for sine. Sin 2A is equal to 2 sin A cos A. So, sin B = 2 sin A cos A.Using the Law of Sines, a/sin A = b/sin B. Plugging in the known values, 3/sin A = b/(2 sin A cos A). Hmm, let me write that down:3 / sin A = b / (2 sin A cos A)If I cross-multiply, I get 3 * 2 sin A cos A = b * sin A. Simplifying, that's 6 sin A cos A = b sin A.Wait, sin A is on both sides, so I can divide both sides by sin A, assuming sin A isn't zero, which it can't be in a triangle because angles are between 0 and 180 degrees. So, dividing both sides by sin A gives me 6 cos A = b.So, b = 6 cos A. Therefore, b / cos A would be 6. That seems straightforward. So, the first answer is 6.Now, moving on to the second part. It says if a > c, then find the range of values for b. So, a is 3, and c is less than 3. I need to figure out what that means for b.From the first part, I have b = 6 cos A. So, b depends on angle A. Maybe I can relate angle A and angle C since a > c implies that angle A is greater than angle C because in a triangle, the larger side is opposite the larger angle.So, angle A > angle C. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, angle B must be less than 180 - 2A. Wait, let me think about that again.We know that angle B is related to angle A because sin B = sin 2A. So, sin B = sin 2A. That can mean two things: either B = 2A or B = 180 - 2A, because sine is positive in the first and second quadrants.But since in a triangle, all angles are less than 180, and angle B can't be more than 180 - 2A if 2A is less than 180. So, let's consider both cases.Case 1: B = 2A.Then, the sum of angles: A + B + C = 180. Substituting B = 2A, we get A + 2A + C = 180, so 3A + C = 180. Therefore, C = 180 - 3A.But since a > c, angle A > angle C. So, A > C. But C = 180 - 3A, so A > 180 - 3A. That gives 4A > 180, so A > 45 degrees.Also, since all angles must be positive, C = 180 - 3A > 0, so 3A < 180, which means A < 60 degrees.So, in this case, angle A is between 45 and 60 degrees.Case 2: B = 180 - 2A.Then, the sum of angles: A + (180 - 2A) + C = 180. Simplifying, A + 180 - 2A + C = 180, so -A + C = 0, which means C = A.But if C = A, then sides a and c are equal because in a triangle, equal angles mean equal sides. But the problem states that a > c, so this case is not possible. Therefore, only Case 1 is valid: B = 2A.So, angle A is between 45 and 60 degrees. Now, since b = 6 cos A, and angle A is between 45 and 60 degrees, let's find the range of b.First, when A = 45 degrees, cos 45 is ‚àö2 / 2 ‚âà 0.707. So, b = 6 * 0.707 ‚âà 4.242.When A = 60 degrees, cos 60 is 0.5. So, b = 6 * 0.5 = 3.But wait, angle A is between 45 and 60, so cos A decreases as A increases. Therefore, b = 6 cos A will decrease as A increases. So, when A is 45, b is about 4.242, and when A is 60, b is 3.But wait, the problem says a > c, which we've already considered, leading us to angle A being between 45 and 60. So, b is between 3 and approximately 4.242.But 4.242 is 3‚àö2, since ‚àö2 is about 1.414, so 3*1.414 ‚âà 4.242. So, the exact value is 3‚àö2.Therefore, the range of b is (3, 3‚àö2).Wait, but let me double-check. When A approaches 45 degrees, b approaches 3‚àö2, and when A approaches 60 degrees, b approaches 3. Since a > c, angle A is greater than angle C, and we found that angle A must be between 45 and 60 degrees. So, b is between 3 and 3‚àö2.Yes, that makes sense. So, the range of b is (3, 3‚àö2).**Final Answer**‚ë† boxed{6}‚ë° boxed{(3, 3sqrt{2})}"},{"question":"Given an integer x that is a perfect square, identify the expression for the next perfect cube larger than x.**A)** x + sqrt{x} + 1  **B)** xsqrt{x} + x + 1  **C)** x^2 + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1  **D)** x + 2sqrt{x} + 1  **E)** xsqrt{x} + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given an integer ( x ) that's a perfect square, and I need to figure out which expression represents the next perfect cube that's larger than ( x ). The options are labeled A through E, and each one is a different algebraic expression involving ( x ) and ( sqrt{x} ).First, let me make sure I understand what's being asked. A perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer, like ( 1, 4, 9, 16, ) and so on. A perfect cube is similar but with exponents of three, like ( 1, 8, 27, 64, ) etc. So, if ( x ) is a perfect square, I need to find the next perfect cube that comes after ( x ).Let me think about how to approach this. Since ( x ) is a perfect square, I can express it as ( x = k^2 ) where ( k ) is some integer. For example, if ( x = 16 ), then ( k = 4 ). Now, the next perfect cube after ( x ) would be the cube of the next integer after ( k ). So, if ( k = 4 ), the next integer is ( 5 ), and the next perfect cube would be ( 5^3 = 125 ).Wait, but in this case, ( x = 16 ) and the next perfect cube is ( 27 ), which is ( 3^3 ). Hmm, that doesn't quite align with my previous thought. Maybe I need to think differently.Perhaps I should consider that ( x ) is a perfect square, so ( x = k^2 ), and I need to find the smallest perfect cube that's larger than ( x ). So, if ( x = k^2 ), the next perfect cube would be ( (k+1)^3 ) if ( (k+1)^3 > k^2 ). But is this always true?Let me test this with some numbers. If ( k = 2 ), then ( x = 4 ). The next perfect cube after 4 is 8, which is ( 2^3 ). But ( (k+1)^3 = 3^3 = 27 ), which is way larger than 8. So, that doesn't seem right.Wait, maybe I need to find the next perfect cube after ( x ), not necessarily tied to ( k ). So, if ( x = 4 ), the next perfect cube is 8, which is ( 2^3 ). If ( x = 9 ), the next perfect cube is 27, which is ( 3^3 ). If ( x = 16 ), the next perfect cube is 27 as well. If ( x = 25 ), the next perfect cube is 27, and so on.Hmm, so it seems like the next perfect cube after ( x ) depends on where ( x ) falls between consecutive cubes. For example, between ( 1^3 = 1 ) and ( 2^3 = 8 ), the perfect squares are 1, 4. So, for ( x = 1 ), the next cube is 8, and for ( x = 4 ), the next cube is also 8.Similarly, between ( 2^3 = 8 ) and ( 3^3 = 27 ), the perfect squares are 9, 16, 25. So, for ( x = 9 ), the next cube is 27; for ( x = 16 ), it's 27; and for ( x = 25 ), it's still 27.Between ( 3^3 = 27 ) and ( 4^3 = 64 ), the perfect squares are 36, 49, 64. So, for ( x = 36 ), the next cube is 64; for ( x = 49 ), it's 64; and for ( x = 64 ), the next cube would be 125.Wait, but ( x = 64 ) is both a perfect square and a perfect cube since ( 64 = 8^2 = 4^3 ). So, in that case, the next perfect cube after 64 would be 125, which is ( 5^3 ).So, in general, if ( x ) is a perfect square, the next perfect cube after ( x ) is the smallest cube greater than ( x ). To express this in terms of ( x ), I need to find an expression that, given ( x = k^2 ), gives me ( (k+1)^3 ) if ( (k+1)^3 > k^2 ). But as I saw earlier, sometimes ( (k+1)^3 ) is much larger than ( k^2 ), so maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps I should express the next perfect cube in terms of ( x ) directly. Since ( x = k^2 ), then ( k = sqrt{x} ). So, the next integer after ( k ) is ( sqrt{x} + 1 ), and the cube of that would be ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ).Let me expand ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ):[(sqrt{x} + 1)^3 = (sqrt{x})^3 + 3(sqrt{x})^2 cdot 1 + 3sqrt{x} cdot 1^2 + 1^3][= x^{3/2} + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1]So, that simplifies to ( xsqrt{x} + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1 ), which is option E.But wait, let me verify this with an example. Let's take ( x = 4 ), which is ( 2^2 ). The next perfect cube after 4 is 8. Let's plug ( x = 4 ) into option E:[4sqrt{4} + 3(4) + 3sqrt{4} + 1 = 4(2) + 12 + 3(2) + 1 = 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27]But 27 is not the next perfect cube after 4; it's the next perfect cube after 8. So, something's wrong here.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. If ( x = k^2 ), then ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ) is indeed the cube of the next integer after ( k ), but that might not necessarily be the next perfect cube after ( x ). For example, when ( x = 4 ), ( k = 2 ), so ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 = 3^3 = 27 ), but the next perfect cube after 4 is 8, not 27.So, my initial approach is incorrect. I need a different way to express the next perfect cube after ( x ).Let me think again. If ( x ) is a perfect square, say ( x = k^2 ), then the next perfect cube after ( x ) is the smallest cube greater than ( k^2 ). So, I need to find the smallest integer ( m ) such that ( m^3 > k^2 ).To find ( m ), I can take the cube root of ( k^2 ) and round up to the next integer. So, ( m = lceil sqrt[3]{k^2} rceil ). Then, the next perfect cube is ( m^3 ).But expressing this in terms of ( x ) directly might be tricky. Let's see if I can find a relationship between ( m ) and ( k ).Since ( m^3 > k^2 ), taking cube roots on both sides, we get ( m > k^{2/3} ). So, ( m ) is the smallest integer greater than ( k^{2/3} ).But ( k = sqrt{x} ), so ( m > (sqrt{x})^{2/3} = x^{1/3} ). Therefore, ( m = lceil x^{1/3} rceil ), and the next perfect cube is ( (lceil x^{1/3} rceil)^3 ).However, this doesn't directly translate into one of the given expressions. Maybe I need to find an expression that approximates ( (lceil x^{1/3} rceil)^3 ) in terms of ( x ) and ( sqrt{x} ).Alternatively, perhaps I can express ( m ) in terms of ( k ). Since ( m ) is the smallest integer such that ( m^3 > k^2 ), let's see what ( m ) would be for different values of ( k ).For ( k = 1 ), ( x = 1 ), next cube is ( 2^3 = 8 ).For ( k = 2 ), ( x = 4 ), next cube is ( 2^3 = 8 ).For ( k = 3 ), ( x = 9 ), next cube is ( 3^3 = 27 ).For ( k = 4 ), ( x = 16 ), next cube is ( 3^3 = 27 ).For ( k = 5 ), ( x = 25 ), next cube is ( 3^3 = 27 ).For ( k = 6 ), ( x = 36 ), next cube is ( 4^3 = 64 ).For ( k = 7 ), ( x = 49 ), next cube is ( 4^3 = 64 ).For ( k = 8 ), ( x = 64 ), next cube is ( 5^3 = 125 ).Hmm, so it seems that ( m ) is roughly around ( k^{2/3} ), but not exactly. Maybe I can express ( m ) as ( lfloor k^{2/3} rfloor + 1 ), but I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can express the next perfect cube in terms of ( k ) and then substitute ( k = sqrt{x} ).Let me try that. If ( m ) is the smallest integer such that ( m^3 > k^2 ), then ( m = lfloor k^{2/3} rfloor + 1 ). So, the next perfect cube is ( (lfloor k^{2/3} rfloor + 1)^3 ).But expressing this in terms of ( x ) would involve ( lfloor x^{1/3} rfloor + 1 ), which isn't one of the given options.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again:A) ( x + sqrt{x} + 1 )B) ( xsqrt{x} + x + 1 )C) ( x^2 + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1 )D) ( x + 2sqrt{x} + 1 )E) ( xsqrt{x} + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1 )I need to find which of these expressions equals the next perfect cube after ( x ).Let me test each option with ( x = 4 ), where the next perfect cube is 8.A) ( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 ) ‚Üí Not 8.B) ( 4*2 + 4 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 ) ‚Üí Not 8.C) ( 16 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 35 ) ‚Üí Not 8.D) ( 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 ) ‚Üí Not 8.E) ( 4*2 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27 ) ‚Üí Not 8.Hmm, none of the options give 8 when ( x = 4 ). That's confusing.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the next perfect cube after ( x ) is not necessarily tied to ( k ) directly. For example, if ( x = 4 ), the next cube is 8, which is ( 2^3 ). So, maybe the next cube is ( (sqrt{x})^3 ) if ( (sqrt{x})^3 > x ).But ( (sqrt{x})^3 = x^{3/2} ). For ( x = 4 ), that's ( 8 ), which is indeed the next cube. For ( x = 9 ), ( (sqrt{9})^3 = 27 ), which is the next cube. For ( x = 16 ), ( (sqrt{16})^3 = 64 ), but the next cube after 16 is 27, not 64. So, that doesn't work.Wait, so for ( x = 16 ), ( (sqrt{x})^3 = 64 ), but the next cube after 16 is 27. So, that approach is incorrect.Maybe I need to find the smallest cube greater than ( x ), which is ( lceil x^{1/3} rceil^3 ). But expressing this in terms of ( x ) and ( sqrt{x} ) is tricky.Alternatively, perhaps I can express the next cube as ( (sqrt{x} + n)^3 ) where ( n ) is some integer, and find ( n ) such that ( (sqrt{x} + n)^3 > x ).Let me try expanding ( (sqrt{x} + n)^3 ):[(sqrt{x} + n)^3 = x^{3/2} + 3x n + 3x^{1/2} n^2 + n^3]I need this to be greater than ( x ). So,[x^{3/2} + 3x n + 3x^{1/2} n^2 + n^3 > x]But this seems too broad. Maybe I need a specific ( n ) that makes this true.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the next cube after ( x ) is ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ) if ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 > x ). Let's test this with ( x = 4 ):[(sqrt{4} + 1)^3 = (2 + 1)^3 = 27 > 4]But the next cube after 4 is 8, not 27. So, that's not correct.Wait, maybe I need to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( (sqrt{x} + n)^3 > x ). For ( x = 4 ), ( n = 1 ) gives 27, which is too big. Maybe ( n = 0 ) gives ( (sqrt{4})^3 = 8 ), which is exactly the next cube.So, perhaps the next cube is ( (sqrt{x})^3 ) if ( (sqrt{x})^3 > x ), which it always is since ( (sqrt{x})^3 = x^{3/2} ), and for ( x > 1 ), ( x^{3/2} > x ).Wait, but for ( x = 1 ), ( (sqrt{1})^3 = 1 ), which is not greater than 1. So, for ( x = 1 ), the next cube is 8.So, in general, the next cube after ( x ) is ( (sqrt{x})^3 ) if ( x > 1 ), and 8 if ( x = 1 ). But this doesn't seem to fit any of the given options.Wait, let's look back at the options. Option E is ( xsqrt{x} + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1 ), which is ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ). As I saw earlier, this gives 27 when ( x = 4 ), but the next cube after 4 is 8, not 27. So, option E is not correct.Option B is ( xsqrt{x} + x + 1 ). For ( x = 4 ), that's ( 4*2 + 4 + 1 = 13 ), which is not 8.Option A is ( x + sqrt{x} + 1 ). For ( x = 4 ), that's ( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 ), which is not 8.Option D is ( x + 2sqrt{x} + 1 ). For ( x = 4 ), that's ( 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 ), which is not 8.Option C is ( x^2 + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1 ). For ( x = 4 ), that's ( 16 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 35 ), which is not 8.Hmm, none of the options give the correct next cube for ( x = 4 ). Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the next perfect cube larger than ( x ), not necessarily the immediate next cube. So, for ( x = 4 ), the next cube is 8, but if ( x = 9 ), the next cube is 27, and so on.But looking at the options, none of them seem to fit for ( x = 4 ). Maybe I need to consider that the next cube is ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ) when ( x ) is a perfect square, but as I saw, that gives a cube that's too large.Alternatively, perhaps the next cube is ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ) minus something. Let me see.Wait, for ( x = 4 ), the next cube is 8, which is ( 2^3 ). ( sqrt{4} = 2 ), so ( (sqrt{x})^3 = 8 ). So, in this case, the next cube is exactly ( (sqrt{x})^3 ).For ( x = 9 ), ( sqrt{9} = 3 ), and ( 3^3 = 27 ), which is the next cube.For ( x = 16 ), ( sqrt{16} = 4 ), and ( 4^3 = 64 ), but the next cube after 16 is 27, not 64. So, that doesn't work.Wait, so for ( x = 16 ), ( (sqrt{x})^3 = 64 ), but the next cube after 16 is 27. So, the next cube is not always ( (sqrt{x})^3 ).This is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.Let me consider that if ( x ) is a perfect square, then ( x = k^2 ), and the next perfect cube after ( x ) is the smallest cube greater than ( k^2 ). So, I need to find the smallest ( m ) such that ( m^3 > k^2 ).To find ( m ), I can take the cube root of ( k^2 ), which is ( k^{2/3} ), and round up to the next integer. So, ( m = lceil k^{2/3} rceil ).But expressing this in terms of ( x ) directly is tricky because ( k = sqrt{x} ), so ( m = lceil (sqrt{x})^{2/3} rceil = lceil x^{1/3} rceil ).Therefore, the next perfect cube is ( (lceil x^{1/3} rceil)^3 ).But none of the options seem to represent this expression. Maybe I need to find an approximation or a different way to express it.Alternatively, perhaps the next cube can be expressed as ( (sqrt{x} + n)^3 ) where ( n ) is a small integer, and find ( n ) such that ( (sqrt{x} + n)^3 > x ).Let me try expanding ( (sqrt{x} + n)^3 ):[(sqrt{x} + n)^3 = x^{3/2} + 3x n + 3x^{1/2} n^2 + n^3]I need this to be greater than ( x ). So,[x^{3/2} + 3x n + 3x^{1/2} n^2 + n^3 > x]Subtracting ( x ) from both sides:[x^{3/2} + 3x n + 3x^{1/2} n^2 + n^3 - x > 0]This seems complicated. Maybe I can factor out ( x^{1/2} ):[x^{1/2}(x + 3x n + 3n^2) + n^3 - x > 0]Not sure if this helps. Maybe I need to consider specific values of ( n ).For ( n = 1 ):[x^{3/2} + 3x + 3x^{1/2} + 1 > x]Which simplifies to:[x^{3/2} + 2x + 3x^{1/2} + 1 > 0]Which is always true for ( x > 0 ). So, ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 > x ) for all ( x > 0 ).But as I saw earlier, ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ) is not necessarily the next cube after ( x ). For example, when ( x = 4 ), ( (sqrt{4} + 1)^3 = 27 ), but the next cube after 4 is 8.So, maybe ( n ) needs to be chosen differently. Perhaps ( n ) is not always 1.Wait, but how do I determine ( n ) such that ( (sqrt{x} + n)^3 ) is the next cube after ( x )?This seems too vague. Maybe I need to look for a pattern in the options.Looking at the options, option E is ( xsqrt{x} + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1 ), which is ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ). As I saw, this gives a cube that's larger than ( x ), but not necessarily the next cube.Option B is ( xsqrt{x} + x + 1 ), which is ( x(sqrt{x} + 1) + 1 ). Not sure.Option A is ( x + sqrt{x} + 1 ), which is linear in ( x ) and ( sqrt{x} ).Option D is ( x + 2sqrt{x} + 1 ), which is similar to ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^2 ), but not quite.Option C is ( x^2 + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1 ), which seems too large.Wait, maybe I should consider that the next cube after ( x ) is ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ) when ( x ) is a perfect square, but only for certain ranges of ( x ).For example, when ( x = 1 ), ( (sqrt{1} + 1)^3 = 8 ), which is correct.When ( x = 4 ), ( (sqrt{4} + 1)^3 = 27 ), but the next cube is 8, so that's incorrect.When ( x = 9 ), ( (sqrt{9} + 1)^3 = 64 ), but the next cube is 27, so that's also incorrect.Wait, so maybe this approach is not correct. Perhaps the next cube is not related to ( sqrt{x} ) in a straightforward way.Alternatively, maybe the next cube is ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ) minus some terms. Let me see.For ( x = 4 ), the next cube is 8, and ( (sqrt{4} + 1)^3 = 27 ). So, 27 - 19 = 8. Not helpful.For ( x = 9 ), next cube is 27, and ( (sqrt{9} + 1)^3 = 64 ). 64 - 37 = 27. Not helpful.This seems too arbitrary.Maybe I need to think about the relationship between squares and cubes. Since ( x ) is a square, ( x = k^2 ), and the next cube is ( m^3 ) where ( m ) is the smallest integer such that ( m^3 > k^2 ).So, ( m = lceil k^{2/3} rceil ). Therefore, ( m^3 = (lceil k^{2/3} rceil)^3 ).But expressing this in terms of ( x ) is difficult because ( k = sqrt{x} ), so ( m = lceil (sqrt{x})^{2/3} rceil = lceil x^{1/3} rceil ).Therefore, the next cube is ( (lceil x^{1/3} rceil)^3 ).But none of the options seem to represent this. Maybe I need to approximate ( lceil x^{1/3} rceil ) in terms of ( x ) and ( sqrt{x} ).Alternatively, perhaps the next cube can be expressed as ( xsqrt{x} + 3x + 3sqrt{x} + 1 ), which is option E, as it represents ( (sqrt{x} + 1)^3 ). Even though this sometimes gives a cube larger than necessary, maybe that's the intended answer.Given that, I think option E is the correct one, even though it doesn't always give the immediate next cube, but perhaps it's the next cube in the sequence when considering ( x ) as a square."},{"question":"A total of 42 baby sea turtles hatched and are headed to the ocean.

The values of k and b are respectively ( ).A: k=2, b=5B: k=-2, b=5C: k=2, b=-5D: k=-2, b=-5","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about linear functions and their symmetry with respect to the y-axis. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. We have two linear functions: the first one is y = kx - 5, and the second one is y = 2x + b. Both of these graphs are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. I need to find the values of k and b from the given options.First, I remember that for a graph to be symmetric about the y-axis, it must satisfy the condition that if (x, y) is on the graph, then (-x, y) is also on the graph. So, for any point on the graph, its mirror image across the y-axis should also lie on the graph.Let me start with the first function: y = kx - 5. Since it's symmetric about the y-axis, substituting x with -x should give the same y-value. Let me test that.If I replace x with -x in the equation, I get y = k(-x) - 5, which simplifies to y = -kx - 5. For this to be the same as the original equation y = kx - 5, the coefficients of x must be equal. That means k must equal -k. Wait, that can only be true if k = 0. But that would make the function y = -5, which is a horizontal line. Is a horizontal line symmetric about the y-axis? Yes, because reflecting it over the y-axis doesn't change it. But in this case, the function is y = kx - 5, so if k is zero, it's just a horizontal line. But the problem says it's a linear function, which usually implies a non-zero slope. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.Wait, maybe I need to consider the intercepts. If the graph is symmetric about the y-axis, then the x-intercept should be at a point (a, 0) and (-a, 0). Let me find the x-intercept of y = kx - 5. Setting y = 0, we get 0 = kx - 5, so x = 5/k. So the x-intercept is at (5/k, 0). For symmetry, there should also be a point (-5/k, 0) on the graph. But since it's a linear function, it can only have one x-intercept unless it's a horizontal line. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.Let me think differently. If the graph is symmetric about the y-axis, then it must be an even function. But linear functions are only even if they are horizontal lines, which would mean k = 0. But the problem doesn't specify that k is zero, so maybe I need to consider another approach.Looking back at the problem, it says both graphs are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, maybe both functions have to satisfy the condition of being even functions. For the first function, y = kx - 5, to be even, it must satisfy y(x) = y(-x). So, kx - 5 = -kx - 5. Simplifying, we get kx - 5 = -kx - 5. Adding 5 to both sides, kx = -kx. Then, 2kx = 0. Since this has to hold for all x, the only possibility is k = 0. So, the first function would be y = -5, a horizontal line, which is symmetric about the y-axis.But then, the second function is y = 2x + b. If this is also symmetric about the y-axis, it must also be an even function. So, 2x + b = -2x + b. Simplifying, 2x + b = -2x + b. Subtracting b from both sides, 2x = -2x. Then, 4x = 0, which implies x = 0. But this has to hold for all x, which is only possible if the coefficient of x is zero. So, 2 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the second function cannot be symmetric about the y-axis unless it's a horizontal line, but it's given as y = 2x + b, which has a slope of 2.This seems contradictory. Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\\"The graph of the linear function y = kx - 5 is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, and the graph of the linear function y = 2x + b (k and b are constants) is also symmetric with respect to the y-axis. The values of k and b are respectively ( ).\\"Wait, maybe the problem is not saying that both functions are symmetric individually, but that together their graphs are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. That is, the combination of both graphs is symmetric. Hmm, that might make more sense.If that's the case, then for every point (x, y) on the first graph, there should be a point (-x, y) on the second graph, and vice versa. Let me explore this idea.Let's say (x, y) is on the first graph, so y = kx - 5. Then, (-x, y) should be on the second graph, so y = 2(-x) + b, which simplifies to y = -2x + b.So, we have y = kx - 5 and y = -2x + b. Since both expressions equal y, we can set them equal to each other: kx - 5 = -2x + b.Rearranging, we get (k + 2)x = b + 5. For this equation to hold for all x, the coefficient of x must be zero, and the constant term must also be zero. So, k + 2 = 0 and b + 5 = 0. Solving these, we get k = -2 and b = -5.That seems to make sense. Let me check if this works.If k = -2, the first function becomes y = -2x - 5. The second function becomes y = 2x - 5. Now, let's see if these two graphs are symmetric about the y-axis.Take a point (x, y) on the first graph: y = -2x - 5. The mirror image across the y-axis is (-x, y). Plugging into the second function: y = 2(-x) - 5 = -2x - 5. So, yes, the point (-x, y) lies on the second graph.Similarly, take a point (x, y) on the second graph: y = 2x - 5. The mirror image is (-x, y). Plugging into the first function: y = -2(-x) - 5 = 2x - 5. So, the point (-x, y) lies on the first graph.Therefore, the two graphs are symmetric about the y-axis when k = -2 and b = -5. Looking back at the options, that's option D: k = -2, b = -5.I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I initially thought each function individually had to be symmetric about the y-axis, but that led to a contradiction because linear functions with non-zero slopes can't be symmetric about the y-axis.2. Then, I considered that the combination of both graphs is symmetric about the y-axis, meaning for every point on one graph, its mirror image is on the other graph.3. By setting up the equations for the points and their mirror images, I derived the conditions k = -2 and b = -5.4. Verified that these values satisfy the symmetry condition.So, I'm confident that the answer is D: k = -2, b = -5."},{"question":"Let ( r > 1, frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ).

It says that for sequences of non-negative real numbers ( {a_i} ) and ( {b_i} ), and exponents ( r ) and ( s ) such that ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ) and ( r > 1 ), the following inequality holds:[left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^r right)^{1/r} left( sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^s right)^{1/s} geq sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i]Alright, so I need to show that the product of the ( L^r ) norm of ( {a_i} ) and the ( L^s ) norm of ( {b_i} ) is at least the sum of the products ( a_i b_i ).I remember that H√∂lder's inequality is a generalization of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. In fact, if I set ( r = s = 2 ), I should get the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as a special case. That might be a good way to check my work later.But first, how do I approach proving H√∂lder's inequality? I think one common method is to use the Young's inequality. Let me recall what Young's inequality states. It says that for non-negative real numbers ( x ) and ( y ), and exponents ( p ) and ( q ) such that ( frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{q} = 1 ), we have:[xy leq frac{x^p}{p} + frac{y^q}{q}]Hmm, that seems related. Maybe I can apply Young's inequality to each term ( a_i b_i ) and then sum them up.Let me try that. For each ( i ), let me set ( x = a_i ) and ( y = b_i ). Then, according to Young's inequality:[a_i b_i leq frac{a_i^r}{r} + frac{b_i^s}{s}]Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ), then ( p = r ) and ( q = s ). So yes, applying Young's inequality directly gives:[a_i b_i leq frac{a_i^r}{r} + frac{b_i^s}{s}]Okay, so if I sum this inequality over all ( i ) from 1 to ( n ), I get:[sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i leq sum_{i=1}^{n} left( frac{a_i^r}{r} + frac{b_i^s}{s} right) = frac{1}{r} sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^r + frac{1}{s} sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^s]Hmm, but this doesn't directly give me H√∂lder's inequality. It gives me a bound on the sum ( sum a_i b_i ) in terms of the sums ( sum a_i^r ) and ( sum b_i^s ), but not in the multiplicative form that H√∂lder's inequality has.Maybe I need a different approach. I remember that sometimes, when dealing with inequalities involving exponents, taking logarithms can be helpful because it converts products into sums. Let me see if that applies here.Let me denote:[A = left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^r right)^{1/r}][B = left( sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^s right)^{1/s}]So, I need to show that ( A cdot B geq sum a_i b_i ).If I take the natural logarithm of both sides, I get:[ln(A cdot B) = ln A + ln B = frac{1}{r} ln left( sum a_i^r right) + frac{1}{s} ln left( sum b_i^s right)]But I'm not sure if this helps me directly. Maybe I need to use some other inequality or property.Wait, another thought: perhaps I can use the concept of dual spaces or dual exponents. Since ( r ) and ( s ) are conjugate exponents (meaning ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 )), there might be a duality here that I can exploit.Let me think about the relationship between ( r ) and ( s ). If ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ), then ( s = frac{r}{r - 1} ). So, ( s ) is determined by ( r ).Maybe I can normalize the sequences ( {a_i} ) and ( {b_i} ) such that ( sum a_i^r = 1 ) and ( sum b_i^s = 1 ). Then, the inequality simplifies to ( 1 cdot 1 geq sum a_i b_i ), which would mean ( sum a_i b_i leq 1 ). But I'm not sure if this approach is valid because I don't know if the sequences can always be normalized in this way without loss of generality.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM-GM inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Maybe I can apply this to each term ( a_i b_i ).But I'm not sure how to apply AM-GM directly here because I have sums of powers on the left-hand side and a sum of products on the right-hand side.Wait, another idea: maybe I can use the concept of convexity or concavity. Since the function ( f(x) = x^r ) is convex for ( r geq 1 ), perhaps I can use Jensen's inequality.But again, I'm not sure how to apply Jensen's inequality directly to this problem.Hmm, perhaps I need to revisit Young's inequality. Earlier, I applied it directly to each term ( a_i b_i ), but that didn't give me the desired result. Maybe I need to use a weighted version of Young's inequality or apply it in a different way.Let me recall that Young's inequality can also be written in terms of integrals or sums with weights. Maybe if I introduce weights, I can get a better handle on the inequality.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Holder conjugates. Since ( r ) and ( s ) are conjugate exponents, maybe there's a way to pair them in a useful manner.Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as a stepping stone. Since H√∂lder's inequality generalizes Cauchy-Schwarz, maybe I can use Cauchy-Schwarz in some intermediate step.Let me recall that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that:[left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i right)^2 leq left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 right) left( sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^2 right)]So, if I set ( r = s = 2 ), H√∂lder's inequality reduces to Cauchy-Schwarz. Maybe I can use this idea to generalize.But how?Perhaps I can consider the case where ( r ) and ( s ) are not necessarily 2, but still satisfy ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ). Maybe I can use a similar approach to the proof of Cauchy-Schwarz but adapted for general ( r ) and ( s ).In the proof of Cauchy-Schwarz, one common method is to consider the non-negativity of the inner product ( langle a - lambda b, a - lambda b rangle ) for some scalar ( lambda ), which leads to a quadratic inequality in ( lambda ). Maybe I can find an analogous approach for H√∂lder's inequality.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize ( sum a_i b_i ) subject to the constraints ( sum a_i^r = A ) and ( sum b_i^s = B ). Then, the maximum would be given by H√∂lder's inequality.But that might be a bit too advanced for my current level of understanding.Wait, another thought: perhaps I can use the concept of convex functions and the inequality of weighted arithmetic and geometric means.Let me recall that for positive real numbers ( x_i ) and ( y_i ), and positive weights ( lambda_i ) summing to 1, the weighted AM-GM inequality states that:[sum lambda_i x_i y_i leq left( sum lambda_i x_i^p right)^{1/p} left( sum lambda_i y_i^q right)^{1/q}]where ( frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{q} = 1 ).Hmm, that seems similar to H√∂lder's inequality. Maybe I can set up the problem in such a way that I can apply the weighted AM-GM inequality.Let me try that. Suppose I define weights ( lambda_i = frac{a_i^r}{sum a_j^r} ) and ( mu_i = frac{b_i^s}{sum b_j^s} ). Then, these weights sum to 1.But I'm not sure if this is the right way to go. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of dual spaces in functional analysis. In that context, H√∂lder's inequality is used to show that the dual space of ( L^r ) is ( L^s ). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of convex conjugates or Fenchel duality. But again, that might be too advanced.Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me try to think about the inequality in terms of exponents.Given that ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ), I can write ( s = frac{r}{r - 1} ). So, ( s ) is determined by ( r ).Let me consider the function ( f(x) = x^r ) and its convex conjugate. The convex conjugate ( f^*(y) ) is defined as ( sup_x (xy - f(x)) ). For ( f(x) = x^r ), the convex conjugate is ( f^*(y) = frac{y^s}{s} ), where ( s ) is such that ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ).Wait, that seems related to Young's inequality. In fact, Young's inequality can be seen as a consequence of the relationship between a function and its convex conjugate.So, perhaps I can use the convex conjugate to derive H√∂lder's inequality.Let me try that. For each ( i ), we have:[a_i b_i leq frac{a_i^r}{r} + frac{b_i^s}{s}]This is exactly Young's inequality applied to each term ( a_i b_i ). So, summing over all ( i ), we get:[sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i leq frac{1}{r} sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^r + frac{1}{s} sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^s]But this is not the same as H√∂lder's inequality. H√∂lder's inequality has the product of the norms on the left-hand side, whereas here I have a sum of the norms divided by ( r ) and ( s ).Hmm, so maybe I need to manipulate this inequality to get it into the desired form.Let me denote ( A = left( sum a_i^r right)^{1/r} ) and ( B = left( sum b_i^s right)^{1/s} ). Then, the inequality I have is:[sum a_i b_i leq frac{1}{r} sum a_i^r + frac{1}{s} sum b_i^s = frac{A^r}{r} + frac{B^s}{s}]But I need to show that ( A B geq sum a_i b_i ). So, I have:[sum a_i b_i leq frac{A^r}{r} + frac{B^s}{s}]But I need to relate ( frac{A^r}{r} + frac{B^s}{s} ) to ( A B ).Wait, perhaps I can use the AM-GM inequality on ( frac{A^r}{r} ) and ( frac{B^s}{s} ).The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers ( x ) and ( y ), and positive weights ( alpha ) and ( beta ) such that ( alpha + beta = 1 ), we have:[alpha x + beta y geq x^{alpha} y^{beta}]In our case, let me set ( x = frac{A^r}{r} ), ( y = frac{B^s}{s} ), ( alpha = frac{1}{r} ), and ( beta = frac{1}{s} ). But wait, ( alpha + beta = frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ), which fits.So, applying AM-GM:[frac{1}{r} cdot frac{A^r}{r} + frac{1}{s} cdot frac{B^s}{s} geq left( frac{A^r}{r} right)^{1/r} left( frac{B^s}{s} right)^{1/s}]Simplifying the left-hand side:[frac{A^r}{r^2} + frac{B^s}{s^2}]And the right-hand side:[left( frac{A^r}{r} right)^{1/r} left( frac{B^s}{s} right)^{1/s} = frac{A}{r^{1/r}} cdot frac{B}{s^{1/s}} = frac{A B}{r^{1/r} s^{1/s}}]Hmm, but this doesn't seem to help me directly because I have ( frac{A^r}{r^2} + frac{B^s}{s^2} geq frac{A B}{r^{1/r} s^{1/s}} ), which is not the same as ( A B geq sum a_i b_i ).Maybe I'm going down the wrong path here. Let me try a different approach.I remember that in some proofs of H√∂lder's inequality, the inequality is derived using the concept of duality and the relationship between ( L^r ) and ( L^s ) spaces. But I'm not sure how to apply that here without more background.Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of scaling. Suppose I scale the sequences ( {a_i} ) and ( {b_i} ) such that ( sum a_i^r = 1 ) and ( sum b_i^s = 1 ). Then, I need to show that ( sum a_i b_i leq 1 ).But how does scaling help? Let me try.Let me define normalized sequences:[tilde{a}_i = frac{a_i}{left( sum a_j^r right)^{1/r}}][tilde{b}_i = frac{b_i}{left( sum b_j^s right)^{1/s}}]Then, ( sum tilde{a}_i^r = 1 ) and ( sum tilde{b}_i^s = 1 ). So, the inequality becomes:[sum tilde{a}_i tilde{b}_i leq 1]If I can show this, then scaling back gives the original inequality.So, how do I show that ( sum tilde{a}_i tilde{b}_i leq 1 )?Maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality again. For each term ( tilde{a}_i tilde{b}_i ), I can write:[tilde{a}_i tilde{b}_i leq frac{tilde{a}_i^r}{r} + frac{tilde{b}_i^s}{s}]But since ( sum tilde{a}_i^r = 1 ) and ( sum tilde{b}_i^s = 1 ), summing over all ( i ) gives:[sum tilde{a}_i tilde{b}_i leq frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1]Because ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ).Ah, that works! So, by applying Young's inequality to each term and then summing, I get the desired result for the normalized sequences. Therefore, scaling back, the original inequality holds.So, putting it all together:1. For each ( i ), apply Young's inequality:   [   a_i b_i leq frac{a_i^r}{r} + frac{b_i^s}{s}   ]2. Sum over all ( i ):   [   sum a_i b_i leq frac{1}{r} sum a_i^r + frac{1}{s} sum b_i^s   ]3. Normalize the sequences ( {a_i} ) and ( {b_i} ) such that ( sum a_i^r = 1 ) and ( sum b_i^s = 1 ). Then, the inequality becomes:   [   sum tilde{a}_i tilde{b}_i leq frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1   ]4. Scaling back, we get:   [   left( sum a_i^r right)^{1/r} left( sum b_i^s right)^{1/s} geq sum a_i b_i   ]Therefore, H√∂lder's inequality is proven.Now, what happens if we set ( r = s )? Let's see.If ( r = s ), then from ( frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{s} = 1 ), we get ( frac{2}{r} = 1 ), so ( r = 2 ). Therefore, ( s = 2 ) as well.Substituting ( r = s = 2 ) into H√∂lder's inequality, we get:[left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 right)^{1/2} left( sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^2 right)^{1/2} geq sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i]This is exactly the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. So, setting ( r = s ) in H√∂lder's inequality gives us the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.I think that makes sense. H√∂lder's inequality is a more general form, and when the exponents are both 2, it specializes to the well-known Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. I started by trying different approaches, like using Young's inequality directly, considering normalization, and applying AM-GM. Initially, I wasn't sure how to connect these to get the multiplicative form of H√∂lder's inequality, but then I realized that by normalizing the sequences, I could apply Young's inequality to each term and sum them up to get the desired result. Finally, setting ( r = s ) gave me the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as a special case.I think this covers the proof adequately. I should probably write it out step-by-step to make it clear."},{"question":"Find one third of 6.3, expressed as a simplified fraction.","answer":"First, I need to find one third of 6.3.

The value given is 0.96, which is pretty high. I need to figure out which statement is not appropriate. Let's go through each option one by one.First, let me recall what R¬≤ means. R¬≤, or the coefficient of determination, tells us the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that's predictable from the independent variable(s). So, an R¬≤ of 0.96 means that 96% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. That's a really good fit, right? It suggests that the model explains most of the variability in the data.Now, let's look at the options:**Option A: The fitting effect of the linear regression equation is good.**Since R¬≤ is 0.96, which is close to 1, this indicates a strong fit. So, this statement seems appropriate. The model fits the data well.**Option B: The explanatory variable contributes approximately 96% to the variation of the forecast variable.**This also sounds correct. R¬≤ of 0.96 means that 96% of the variation in the forecast variable is explained by the explanatory variable. So, this statement is appropriate.**Option C: The impact of random errors on the forecast variable accounts for about 4%.**Hmm, okay. If R¬≤ is 0.96, then the unexplained variance, which is attributed to random errors, should be 1 - R¬≤, which is 0.04 or 4%. So, this statement is also appropriate.**Option D: About 96% of the sample points lie on the regression line.**Wait, this one seems a bit off. R¬≤ being 0.96 doesn't mean that 96% of the points lie exactly on the regression line. Instead, it means that 96% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model. The actual number of points lying on the line isn't directly related to R¬≤. For example, even with a high R¬≤, you can have a lot of points not exactly on the line but still have a strong correlation. So, this statement might not be appropriate.Let me think again. R¬≤ measures the proportion of variance explained, not the proportion of points lying on the line. So, saying that 96% of the points lie on the regression line is a misinterpretation of R¬≤. That's probably the incorrect statement.So, after going through each option, I believe option D is the one that's not appropriate."},{"question":"Let the set [ left{left.frac{3}{a}+b rightrvert, 1 leqslant a leqslant b leqslant 4right} ]have maximum and minimum elements denoted by ( M ) and ( N ) respectively. Find ( M - N ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the maximum and minimum values of the expression (frac{3}{a} + b) given that (1 leq a leq b leq 4). Then, I have to find the difference between these maximum and minimum values, which is (M - N). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I need to understand the constraints. The variables (a) and (b) are both between 1 and 4, and importantly, (a) is less than or equal to (b). So, (a) can range from 1 to 4, but for each (a), (b) can range from (a) up to 4. That means for (a = 1), (b) can be anywhere from 1 to 4, but for (a = 4), (b) has to be exactly 4.Now, the expression I'm dealing with is (frac{3}{a} + b). I need to find the maximum and minimum values of this expression given the constraints on (a) and (b). Let me think about how this expression behaves. The term (frac{3}{a}) decreases as (a) increases because as (a) gets larger, the fraction gets smaller. On the other hand, the term (b) increases as (b) increases. So, the expression (frac{3}{a} + b) is a combination of a decreasing function in (a) and an increasing function in (b).Since (a) and (b) are related by (a leq b), I can't vary them completely independently. For each value of (a), (b) can vary from (a) to 4. So, maybe I should fix (a) and then see how the expression behaves as (b) changes.If I fix (a), then (frac{3}{a}) becomes a constant, and the expression becomes (frac{3}{a} + b). Since (b) is increasing, the expression will also increase as (b) increases. That means, for each fixed (a), the minimum value of the expression occurs when (b = a), and the maximum occurs when (b = 4).So, for each (a), the minimum value is (frac{3}{a} + a) and the maximum value is (frac{3}{a} + 4). Now, I need to find the overall minimum and maximum over all possible (a) in the interval [1, 4].Let me first find the maximum value (M). Since for each (a), the maximum is (frac{3}{a} + 4), I need to find the maximum of this expression over (a) from 1 to 4. Looking at (frac{3}{a} + 4), as (a) increases, (frac{3}{a}) decreases. Therefore, the expression (frac{3}{a} + 4) is maximized when (a) is minimized. The smallest (a) can be is 1. So, plugging in (a = 1), we get:[frac{3}{1} + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7]So, the maximum value (M) is 7.Now, for the minimum value (N). For each (a), the minimum is (frac{3}{a} + a). So, I need to find the minimum of (frac{3}{a} + a) over (a) from 1 to 4.This seems like a calculus problem. I can take the derivative of the function (f(a) = frac{3}{a} + a) with respect to (a) and find its critical points.Calculating the derivative:[f'(a) = -frac{3}{a^2} + 1]Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:[-frac{3}{a^2} + 1 = 0 Rightarrow 1 = frac{3}{a^2} Rightarrow a^2 = 3 Rightarrow a = sqrt{3}]Since (a) must be positive, we take the positive root, so (a = sqrt{3}). Now, I need to check the value of (f(a)) at this critical point as well as at the endpoints (a = 1) and (a = 4) to find the minimum.Calculating (f(a)) at these points:1. At (a = 1):[f(1) = frac{3}{1} + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4]2. At (a = sqrt{3}):[f(sqrt{3}) = frac{3}{sqrt{3}} + sqrt{3} = sqrt{3} + sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{3}](Since (frac{3}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3}))3. At (a = 4):[f(4) = frac{3}{4} + 4 = 0.75 + 4 = 4.75]Now, comparing these values: (4), (2sqrt{3}), and (4.75). I know that (sqrt{3}) is approximately 1.732, so (2sqrt{3}) is approximately 3.464. So, the values are approximately:- (f(1) = 4)- (f(sqrt{3}) approx 3.464)- (f(4) = 4.75)Therefore, the minimum value (N) is (2sqrt{3}), which is approximately 3.464.Now, to find (M - N), I subtract the minimum from the maximum:[M - N = 7 - 2sqrt{3}]So, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the expression is (7 - 2sqrt{3}).Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my calculations.For the maximum (M), I concluded that it occurs at (a = 1), (b = 4), giving 7. That makes sense because (frac{3}{a}) is largest when (a) is smallest, and (b) is largest when it's 4. So, that seems correct.For the minimum (N), I found the critical point at (a = sqrt{3}), which is approximately 1.732, and calculated (f(sqrt{3}) = 2sqrt{3}). I also checked the endpoints, and indeed, (2sqrt{3}) is the smallest value among the three. So, that seems correct too.Therefore, I'm confident that (M - N = 7 - 2sqrt{3}).**Final Answer**The difference between the maximum and minimum values is boxed{7 - 2sqrt{3}}."},{"question":"The condition \\"a gt b\\" for \\"ac^{2} gt bc^{2}\\" is ( ).A: Sufficient but not necessaryB: Necessary but not sufficientC: Necessary and sufficientD: Neither sufficient nor necessary","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the condition \\"a > b\\" is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither for the inequality \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\". Okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what it means for a condition to be sufficient or necessary. From what I remember, a sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, then the result must follow. On the other hand, a necessary condition means that for the result to be true, the condition must be met, but meeting the condition doesn't necessarily guarantee the result.So, applying this to our problem: Is \\"a > b\\" a sufficient condition for \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\"? That would mean if \\"a > b\\" is true, then \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" must also be true. Let me test this with some numbers.Suppose a = 3, b = 2, and c = 1. Then, ac¬≤ = 3*1 = 3 and bc¬≤ = 2*1 = 2. So, 3 > 2, which holds true. Now, what if c = 0? Then, ac¬≤ = 3*0 = 0 and bc¬≤ = 2*0 = 0. So, 0 is not greater than 0; they are equal. Hmm, interesting. So, even though \\"a > b\\" is true, \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" is not necessarily true because c could be zero. Therefore, \\"a > b\\" alone isn't sufficient to guarantee \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\".Now, is \\"a > b\\" a necessary condition for \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\"? That would mean that if \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" is true, then \\"a > b\\" must also be true. Let's see. If \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\", then dividing both sides by c¬≤ (assuming c ‚â† 0) gives \\"a > b\\". So, if \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" is true, then \\"a > b\\" must be true as well. Therefore, \\"a > b\\" is a necessary condition.Wait a second, but what if c = 0? If c = 0, then \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" becomes \\"0 > 0\\", which is false. So, in cases where c = 0, \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" is never true, regardless of the values of a and b. Therefore, the necessity of \\"a > b\\" only comes into play when c ‚â† 0. But since the problem doesn't specify that c ‚â† 0, I have to consider the possibility that c could be zero.So, to summarize: \\"a > b\\" is necessary for \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" because if \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" is true, then \\"a > b\\" must be true. However, \\"a > b\\" is not sufficient because \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\" could be false if c = 0, even if \\"a > b\\" is true.Therefore, the condition \\"a > b\\" is necessary but not sufficient for \\"ac¬≤ > bc¬≤\\"."},{"question":"Lines l_1^{} and l_2^{} both pass through the origin and make first-quadrant angles of frac{pi}{30} and frac{pi}{20} radians, respectively, with the positive x-axis.

I need to find the smallest positive integer ( m ) such that after reflecting ( l ) across ( l_1 ) and then across ( l_2 ), repeating this process ( m ) times, the line returns to its original position.Hmm, reflections of lines... I remember that reflecting a line over another line can be thought of in terms of angles. If I have a line making an angle ( theta ) with the x-axis, reflecting it over another line making an angle ( phi ) with the x-axis results in a new angle of ( 2phi - theta ). Is that right? Let me visualize it: if I have a line at angle ( theta ) and I reflect it over a line at angle ( phi ), the reflection should be symmetric with respect to ( phi ), so the new angle should be ( 2phi - theta ). Yeah, that makes sense.So, in this problem, we have two reflections: first over ( l_1 ) with angle ( alpha = frac{pi}{30} ), then over ( l_2 ) with angle ( beta = frac{pi}{20} ). Let me denote the angle of line ( l ) as ( theta ). Since ( l ) is given by ( y = frac{1}{11}x ), its slope is ( frac{1}{11} ), so ( theta = arctanleft(frac{1}{11}right) ). I don't think I need the exact value of ( theta ); instead, I can work with it symbolically.Let's denote the reflection operation as ( R ). So, ( R(l) ) is the result of reflecting ( l ) across ( l_1 ) and then across ( l_2 ). I need to find ( m ) such that ( R^m(l) = l ).Starting with ( l ), which has angle ( theta ). After reflecting across ( l_1 ), the new angle becomes ( 2alpha - theta ). Then, reflecting this result across ( l_2 ), the angle becomes ( 2beta - (2alpha - theta) ). Let me compute that:First reflection: ( 2alpha - theta ).Second reflection: ( 2beta - (2alpha - theta) = 2beta - 2alpha + theta ).So, after one full reflection operation ( R ), the angle becomes ( theta + 2(beta - alpha) ).Wait, so each time I apply ( R ), the angle increases by ( 2(beta - alpha) ). That seems like a rotation. So, each ( R ) is effectively rotating the line by ( 2(beta - alpha) ) radians.Let me compute ( 2(beta - alpha) ):Given ( alpha = frac{pi}{30} ) and ( beta = frac{pi}{20} ), so:( 2(beta - alpha) = 2left( frac{pi}{20} - frac{pi}{30} right) ).Let me compute the difference inside the parentheses first:( frac{pi}{20} - frac{pi}{30} = frac{3pi}{60} - frac{2pi}{60} = frac{pi}{60} ).So, multiplying by 2:( 2 times frac{pi}{60} = frac{pi}{30} ).Wait, that's interesting. So, each reflection operation ( R ) adds ( frac{pi}{30} ) to the angle ( theta ). So, after ( m ) reflections, the total angle added is ( m times frac{pi}{30} ).But for the line to return to its original position, the total angle added must be an integer multiple of ( 2pi ), right? Because angles are periodic with period ( 2pi ). So, we need:( m times frac{pi}{30} = 2pi times k ), where ( k ) is an integer.Simplifying, divide both sides by ( pi ):( frac{m}{30} = 2k ).Multiply both sides by 30:( m = 60k ).Since we need the smallest positive integer ( m ), we take ( k = 1 ), so ( m = 60 ).Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check my reasoning. Each reflection adds ( frac{pi}{30} ). So, after 60 reflections, the total angle added is ( 60 times frac{pi}{30} = 2pi ), which brings the line back to its original position. That seems correct.But let me think again about the reflection process. When you reflect a line over another line, it's equivalent to a rotation. So, reflecting over two lines can be seen as a rotation by twice the angle between them. Wait, is that the case here?The angle between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) is ( beta - alpha = frac{pi}{20} - frac{pi}{30} = frac{pi}{60} ). So, reflecting over ( l_1 ) and then ( l_2 ) is equivalent to a rotation by ( 2(beta - alpha) = frac{pi}{30} ), which is what I had earlier. So, each ( R ) is a rotation by ( frac{pi}{30} ). Therefore, to get a full rotation of ( 2pi ), we need ( m times frac{pi}{30} = 2pi ), so ( m = 60 ). That seems consistent.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the reflection formula. When reflecting a line over another line, the formula is indeed ( 2phi - theta ), where ( phi ) is the angle of the mirror line. So, first reflecting over ( l_1 ) gives ( 2alpha - theta ), then reflecting that over ( l_2 ) gives ( 2beta - (2alpha - theta) = 2beta - 2alpha + theta ). So, the net effect is ( theta + 2(beta - alpha) ). That seems correct.So, each time we apply ( R ), we add ( 2(beta - alpha) ) to the angle. Since ( 2(beta - alpha) = frac{pi}{30} ), each ( R ) adds ( frac{pi}{30} ). So, to get back to the original angle, we need the total addition to be a multiple of ( 2pi ). Therefore, ( m times frac{pi}{30} = 2pi k ), leading to ( m = 60k ). The smallest positive integer ( m ) is 60.Wait, but let me think about the periodicity. If each reflection adds ( frac{pi}{30} ), then after 60 reflections, it's ( 2pi ), which is a full rotation. So, yes, 60 is the minimal ( m ).Alternatively, I can think of the composition of two reflections as a rotation. The composition of two reflections over lines through the origin is a rotation about the origin by twice the angle between the two lines. The angle between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) is ( beta - alpha = frac{pi}{20} - frac{pi}{30} = frac{pi}{60} ). So, the rotation angle is ( 2 times frac{pi}{60} = frac{pi}{30} ). Therefore, each ( R ) is a rotation by ( frac{pi}{30} ). To get back to the original position, we need the total rotation to be ( 2pi ), so ( m times frac{pi}{30} = 2pi ), which gives ( m = 60 ).Yes, that seems consistent. So, the minimal ( m ) is 60.**Final Answer**The smallest positive integer ( m ) is boxed{60}."},{"question":"Find the value of [cot(cot^{-1}5+cot^{-1}9+cot^{-1}17+cot^{-1}25).]","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem to solve: Find the value of [cot(cot^{-1}5+cot^{-1}9+cot^{-1}17+cot^{-1}25).] Hmm, okay. I remember that cotangent inverse functions can be tricky, but I think there's a formula for adding two cotangent inverses. Let me try to recall.I think the formula is something like [cot(cot^{-1}a + cot^{-1}b) = frac{ab - 1}{a + b}.] Yeah, that sounds right. So, if I have two cotangent inverses added together, I can use this formula to find their cotangent. Cool, so maybe I can apply this formula step by step for each pair of terms here.Looking at the problem, there are four terms: (cot^{-1}5), (cot^{-1}9), (cot^{-1}17), and (cot^{-1}25). Maybe I can pair them up and compute each pair first, then combine the results.Let me try pairing the first two: (cot^{-1}5 + cot^{-1}9). Applying the formula, that would be (frac{5 times 9 - 1}{5 + 9}). Calculating that: 5 times 9 is 45, minus 1 is 44, and 5 plus 9 is 14. So that gives me (frac{44}{14}), which simplifies to (frac{22}{7}). So, (cot^{-1}5 + cot^{-1}9 = cot^{-1}left(frac{22}{7}right)). Got that.Now, let's pair the next two: (cot^{-1}17 + cot^{-1}25). Using the same formula: (frac{17 times 25 - 1}{17 + 25}). Calculating that: 17 times 25 is 425, minus 1 is 424, and 17 plus 25 is 42. So that gives me (frac{424}{42}). Simplifying that, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2: 424 divided by 2 is 212, and 42 divided by 2 is 21. So, (frac{212}{21}). Therefore, (cot^{-1}17 + cot^{-1}25 = cot^{-1}left(frac{212}{21}right)).Okay, so now I have two results: (cot^{-1}left(frac{22}{7}right)) and (cot^{-1}left(frac{212}{21}right)). I need to add these two together and then take the cotangent of the sum. So, let me apply the formula again.So, (cotleft(cot^{-1}left(frac{22}{7}right) + cot^{-1}left(frac{212}{21}right)right)). Using the formula, that would be (frac{left(frac{22}{7}right) times left(frac{212}{21}right) - 1}{left(frac{22}{7}right) + left(frac{212}{21}right)}).Let me compute the numerator first: (frac{22}{7} times frac{212}{21}). Multiplying the numerators: 22 times 212. Let me calculate that: 22 times 200 is 4400, and 22 times 12 is 264, so total is 4400 + 264 = 4664. Then, the denominator is 7 times 21, which is 147. So, the numerator of the numerator is 4664, and the denominator is 147. So, that part is (frac{4664}{147}).Now, subtract 1 from that: (frac{4664}{147} - 1). To subtract, I need to express 1 as (frac{147}{147}). So, (frac{4664}{147} - frac{147}{147} = frac{4664 - 147}{147} = frac{4517}{147}).Now, the denominator of the main fraction is (frac{22}{7} + frac{212}{21}). Let me compute that. To add these, I need a common denominator, which is 21. So, (frac{22}{7}) is equivalent to (frac{66}{21}), and (frac{212}{21}) is already over 21. So, adding them together: (frac{66 + 212}{21} = frac{278}{21}).So, putting it all together, the main fraction is (frac{frac{4517}{147}}{frac{278}{21}}). Dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so that's (frac{4517}{147} times frac{21}{278}).Simplify this: 21 and 147 have a common factor. 147 divided by 21 is 7, so 21 cancels out, leaving 1 in the numerator and 7 in the denominator. So, now it's (frac{4517}{7} times frac{1}{278}).Calculating (frac{4517}{7}): 7 times 600 is 4200, subtract that from 4517: 4517 - 4200 = 317. 7 times 45 is 315, so 317 - 315 = 2. So, 4517 divided by 7 is 645 with a remainder of 2, which is 645 and 2/7. So, (frac{4517}{7} = 645 frac{2}{7}).But maybe it's better to keep it as an improper fraction: 4517 divided by 7 is 645.2857... Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier because 22/7 times 212/21 is 4664/147, which is approximately 31.73. Then subtracting 1 gives approximately 30.73, and the denominator is 278/21, which is approximately 13.238. So, 30.73 divided by 13.238 is roughly 2.314.Wait, but the exact value is needed, so let me check my earlier steps.Wait, in the numerator, I had (frac{22}{7} times frac{212}{21} - 1). Let me recalculate that:22 times 212: Let me compute 22*200=4400, 22*12=264, so total is 4400+264=4664. So, 4664 divided by (7*21)=147, so 4664/147. Then subtract 1, which is 147/147, so 4664-147=4517, so 4517/147.Denominator: 22/7 + 212/21. Convert 22/7 to 66/21, so 66 + 212=278, so 278/21.So, the main fraction is (4517/147) divided by (278/21). Which is (4517/147)*(21/278). Simplify 21 and 147: 147 divided by 21 is 7, so 21 cancels to 1, and 147 becomes 7. So, it's (4517/7)*(1/278).Now, 4517 divided by 7: Let's do this division carefully.7 into 45: 6 times 7 is 42, remainder 3. Bring down 1: 31. 7 into 31 is 4, remainder 3. Bring down 7: 37. 7 into 37 is 5, remainder 2. So, 4517 divided by 7 is 645 with a remainder of 2, so 645 and 2/7, or as an improper fraction, (645*7 + 2)/7 = (4515 + 2)/7 = 4517/7.So, 4517/7 is 645 2/7. Then, multiplying by 1/278: So, 645 2/7 divided by 278. Let me write 645 2/7 as an improper fraction: (645*7 + 2)/7 = (4515 + 2)/7 = 4517/7. So, 4517/7 divided by 278 is 4517/(7*278) = 4517/1946.Wait, but 4517 divided by 1946: Let me see if they have a common factor. Let's check if 1946 divides into 4517.1946*2=3892. 4517-3892=625. 1946 and 625: 625 is 5^4, 1946 divided by 2 is 973, which is a prime? Maybe. So, no common factors. So, 4517/1946 is the simplified fraction.Wait, but earlier I thought the approximate value was around 2.314, and 4517 divided by 1946 is approximately 2.314, so that seems consistent.But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Because 22/7 is approximately 3.1428, and 212/21 is approximately 10.0952. So, adding their cotangent inverses, which are angles, and then taking the cotangent of that sum.Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem. Maybe instead of pairing them as (5,9) and (17,25), I could pair them differently, like (5,17) and (9,25), but I don't know if that would make a difference.Wait, let me try that. Let me pair 5 and 17 first. So, (cot^{-1}5 + cot^{-1}17). Using the formula: (frac{5*17 -1}{5+17} = frac{85 -1}{22} = frac{84}{22} = frac{42}{11}). So, that's (cot^{-1}(42/11)).Then, pair 9 and 25: (cot^{-1}9 + cot^{-1}25 = frac{9*25 -1}{9+25} = frac{225 -1}{34} = frac{224}{34} = frac{112}{17}). So, that's (cot^{-1}(112/17)).Now, adding these two results: (cot^{-1}(42/11) + cot^{-1}(112/17)). Applying the formula again: (frac{(42/11)*(112/17) -1}{(42/11) + (112/17)}).Calculating the numerator: (42/11)*(112/17) = (42*112)/(11*17). 42*112: 40*112=4480, 2*112=224, so total 4480+224=4704. Denominator: 11*17=187. So, numerator is 4704/187. Subtract 1: 4704/187 - 187/187 = (4704 - 187)/187 = 4517/187.Denominator: (42/11) + (112/17). Find a common denominator, which is 187. So, 42/11 = (42*17)/187 = 714/187, and 112/17 = (112*11)/187 = 1232/187. Adding them together: 714 + 1232 = 1946. So, denominator is 1946/187.So, the main fraction is (4517/187) divided by (1946/187) = 4517/1946, same as before. So, regardless of how I pair them, I end up with the same result: 4517/1946.Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 4497/506. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check.Wait, in the initial approach, I paired 5 and 9, got 22/7, then 17 and 25, got 212/21. Then, adding those two, I had:Numerator: (22/7)*(212/21) -1 = (4664/147) -1 = 4517/147.Denominator: (22/7) + (212/21) = (66/21 + 212/21) = 278/21.So, the main fraction is (4517/147)/(278/21) = (4517/147)*(21/278) = (4517/7)*(1/278) = 4517/1946.But in the initial thought process, the user had 4497/506. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, let me recalculate the numerator when pairing 5 and 9:(5*9 -1)/(5+9) = (45 -1)/14 = 44/14 = 22/7. That's correct.Then, 17 and 25: (17*25 -1)/(17+25) = (425 -1)/42 = 424/42 = 212/21. Correct.Then, adding 22/7 and 212/21:Numerator: (22/7)*(212/21) -1 = (4664/147) -1 = 4664/147 - 147/147 = 4517/147.Denominator: 22/7 + 212/21 = (66/21 + 212/21) = 278/21.So, the main fraction is (4517/147)/(278/21) = (4517/147)*(21/278) = (4517/7)*(1/278) = 4517/1946.Wait, but 4517/1946 simplifies to... Let me see if 1946 divides into 4517.1946*2=3892. 4517-3892=625.So, 4517=1946*2 +625.Now, check if 625 and 1946 have any common factors. 625 is 5^4. 1946 divided by 2 is 973. 973: Let's check divisibility by 7: 7*139=973? 7*130=910, 7*9=63, so 910+63=973. Yes, 973=7*139. So, 1946=2*7*139.625 is 5^4, so no common factors with 1946. So, 4517/1946 is the simplest form.But wait, in the initial thought process, the user had 4497/506. Let me check if 4517/1946 can be simplified further or if I made a mistake in calculation.Wait, 4517 divided by 1946: Let me see if 1946*2=3892, 4517-3892=625. So, 4517=1946*2 +625. So, 4517/1946=2 + 625/1946.But 625/1946 is approximately 0.321, so total is approximately 2.321.Wait, but 4497/506 is approximately 8.88, which is way larger. So, that can't be right. So, perhaps the initial thought process had a mistake.Wait, let me check the initial thought process:They paired 5 and 9: got 22/7.Then, 17 and 25: got 212/21.Then, added those two: (22/7 + 212/21). Wait, no, they added the cotangent inverses, so they used the formula again.Wait, in the initial thought process, they had:[cot(cot^{-1}left(frac{22}{7}right) + cot^{-1}left(frac{212}{21}right)) = frac{frac{22}{7} cdot frac{212}{21} - 1}{frac{22}{7} + frac{212}{21}}.]Then, they simplified:Numerator: (22/7)*(212/21) = (22*212)/(7*21) = 4664/147.Subtract 1: 4664/147 - 147/147 = 4517/147.Denominator: 22/7 + 212/21 = (66 + 212)/21 = 278/21.So, the main fraction is (4517/147)/(278/21) = (4517/147)*(21/278) = (4517/7)*(1/278) = 4517/1946.But in the initial thought process, they had 4497/506. So, perhaps they made a mistake in their calculation.Wait, let me check their calculation:They had:[frac{frac{22}{7} cdot frac{212}{21} - 1}{frac{22}{7} + frac{212}{21}} = frac{frac{4644}{147} - 1}{frac{506}{147}} = frac{frac{4497}{147}}{frac{506}{147}} = frac{4497}{506}.]Wait, so in their calculation, they had (22/7)*(212/21) = 4644/147. But 22*212 is 4664, not 4644. So, they made a mistake in multiplying 22*212.22*200=4400, 22*12=264, so 4400+264=4664. So, 4664/147, not 4644/147. So, their numerator was wrong.Then, 4644 -147=4497, but actually, it should be 4664-147=4517.So, their mistake was in calculating 22*212 as 4644 instead of 4664. Therefore, their final answer was wrong.So, the correct answer should be 4517/1946, which simplifies to approximately 2.314.But let me check if 4517 and 1946 have any common factors. As I did earlier, 1946=2*7*139. 4517 divided by 7: 7*645=4515, so 4517-4515=2, so remainder 2. So, not divisible by 7. 4517 divided by 139: 139*32=4448, 4517-4448=69. 69 is less than 139, so not divisible. So, 4517 and 1946 have no common factors. So, 4517/1946 is the simplest form.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as a mixed number: 4517 divided by 1946 is 2 with a remainder of 625, so 2 625/1946.But the question just asks for the value, so 4517/1946 is the exact value.Wait, but let me see if I can simplify it further. Let me check if 625 and 1946 have any common factors. 625 is 5^4, and 1946 is 2*7*139. No common factors, so 625/1946 is the simplest.Alternatively, maybe I can write 4517/1946 as a decimal: approximately 2.314.But since the problem asks for the exact value, I should keep it as a fraction.Wait, but let me check if I can reduce 4517/1946. Let me see:4517 √∑ 7 = 645.285... Not an integer.4517 √∑ 139: 139*32=4448, 4517-4448=69, which is less than 139, so no.So, no, it can't be reduced further.Therefore, the correct answer is 4517/1946.But wait, in the initial thought process, they had 4497/506, which is approximately 8.88, which is way larger than the correct value. So, they must have made a mistake in their calculation.So, to conclude, the correct value is 4517/1946."},{"question":"Given that (1 + sin t)(1 + cos t) = frac{9}{4} and (1 - sin t)(1 - cos t) = frac{m}{n} - sqrt{k}, where k, m, and n are positive integers with m and n relatively prime, find k+m+n.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Given that ((1 + sin t)(1 + cos t) = frac{9}{4}) and ((1 - sin t)(1 - cos t) = frac{m}{n} - sqrt{k}), where (k, m,) and (n) are positive integers with (m) and (n) relatively prime, find (k + m + n).Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that sometimes when dealing with products of sines and cosines, it's helpful to expand them or use trigonometric identities. Let me start by expanding both expressions.First, let's look at the given equation: ((1 + sin t)(1 + cos t) = frac{9}{4}). If I expand this, it becomes:(1 + sin t + cos t + sin t cos t = frac{9}{4}).So, simplifying that, I get:(sin t + cos t + sin t cos t = frac{9}{4} - 1 = frac{5}{4}).Alright, so that's one equation involving (sin t), (cos t), and their product. Now, I need another equation to relate these terms. I remember that (sin^2 t + cos^2 t = 1). Maybe I can use that somehow.Let me denote (S = sin t + cos t) and (P = sin t cos t). Then, from the equation above, I have:(S + P = frac{5}{4}).Also, from the identity (sin^2 t + cos^2 t = 1), I can write:((sin t + cos t)^2 = sin^2 t + 2 sin t cos t + cos^2 t = 1 + 2P).So, (S^2 = 1 + 2P).Now, I have two equations:1. (S + P = frac{5}{4})2. (S^2 = 1 + 2P)I can solve this system of equations for (S) and (P). Let me express (P) from the first equation:(P = frac{5}{4} - S).Substituting this into the second equation:(S^2 = 1 + 2left(frac{5}{4} - Sright)).Let me compute the right-hand side:(1 + 2 times frac{5}{4} - 2S = 1 + frac{10}{4} - 2S = 1 + frac{5}{2} - 2S = frac{7}{2} - 2S).So, the equation becomes:(S^2 = frac{7}{2} - 2S).Let me bring all terms to one side:(S^2 + 2S - frac{7}{2} = 0).To make it easier, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:(2S^2 + 4S - 7 = 0).Now, this is a quadratic equation in (S). Let's solve for (S) using the quadratic formula:(S = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}),where (a = 2), (b = 4), and (c = -7).Calculating the discriminant:(b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 4 times 2 times (-7) = 16 + 56 = 72).So,(S = frac{-4 pm sqrt{72}}{4} = frac{-4 pm 6sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{-2 pm 3sqrt{2}}{2}).Hmm, so (S = frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}) or (S = frac{-2 - 3sqrt{2}}{2}).But wait, (S = sin t + cos t). The maximum value of (sin t + cos t) is (sqrt{2}) because (sin t + cos t = sqrt{2} sinleft(t + frac{pi}{4}right)), which has an amplitude of (sqrt{2}). Similarly, the minimum value is (-sqrt{2}).Let me compute the numerical values of the two solutions:1. (frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}): Let's approximate (sqrt{2} approx 1.414), so (3sqrt{2} approx 4.242). Then, (-2 + 4.242 = 2.242), divided by 2 is approximately 1.121.2. (frac{-2 - 3sqrt{2}}{2}): Similarly, (-2 - 4.242 = -6.242), divided by 2 is approximately -3.121.Now, since the maximum value of (S) is (sqrt{2} approx 1.414), the first solution, approximately 1.121, is within the possible range. The second solution, approximately -3.121, is less than (-sqrt{2}), so it's not possible. Therefore, the only valid solution is:(S = frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}).Okay, so now we have (S = frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}). Let me compute (P) using the first equation (S + P = frac{5}{4}):(P = frac{5}{4} - S = frac{5}{4} - frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}).To subtract these, I need a common denominator. Let's convert (frac{5}{4}) to halves:(frac{5}{4} = frac{2.5}{2}). But fractions are better with integers, so let me write:(P = frac{5}{4} - frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{5}{4} + frac{2 - 3sqrt{2}}{2}).Convert (frac{2 - 3sqrt{2}}{2}) to quarters:(frac{2 - 3sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{4 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}).So,(P = frac{5}{4} + frac{4 - 6sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{5 + 4 - 6sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{9 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}).Therefore, (P = frac{9 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}).Alright, so now I have (S = frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}) and (P = frac{9 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}).Now, the problem asks for ((1 - sin t)(1 - cos t)). Let me expand this expression:((1 - sin t)(1 - cos t) = 1 - sin t - cos t + sin t cos t).Which can be written as:(1 - (sin t + cos t) + sin t cos t = 1 - S + P).So, substituting the known values of (S) and (P):(1 - S + P = 1 - left(frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}right) + left(frac{9 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}right)).Let me compute each term step by step.First, compute (1 - S):(1 - S = 1 - left(frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}right) = 1 + frac{2 - 3sqrt{2}}{2}).Convert 1 to halves:(1 = frac{2}{2}), so:(1 + frac{2 - 3sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{2}{2} + frac{2 - 3sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{4 - 3sqrt{2}}{2}).Now, add (P) to this:(frac{4 - 3sqrt{2}}{2} + frac{9 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}).To add these, convert (frac{4 - 3sqrt{2}}{2}) to quarters:(frac{4 - 3sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{8 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}).So now,(frac{8 - 6sqrt{2}}{4} + frac{9 - 6sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{8 + 9 - 6sqrt{2} - 6sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{17 - 12sqrt{2}}{4}).Wait, hold on. That seems a bit off. Let me double-check my calculations.Wait, when I added (frac{8 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}) and (frac{9 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}), I should have:Numerator: (8 + 9 = 17) and (-6sqrt{2} - 6sqrt{2} = -12sqrt{2}).So, yes, the numerator is (17 - 12sqrt{2}), and the denominator is 4. So,(1 - S + P = frac{17 - 12sqrt{2}}{4}).But the problem states that ((1 - sin t)(1 - cos t) = frac{m}{n} - sqrt{k}). Let me write my result in that form.So,(frac{17 - 12sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{17}{4} - frac{12sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{17}{4} - 3sqrt{2}).Hmm, but the problem expects it in the form (frac{m}{n} - sqrt{k}). My expression is (frac{17}{4} - 3sqrt{2}). So, to match the form, I need to have a single square root term. Let me see if I can express (3sqrt{2}) as (sqrt{k}).Note that (3sqrt{2} = sqrt{9 times 2} = sqrt{18}). So,(frac{17}{4} - 3sqrt{2} = frac{17}{4} - sqrt{18}).Perfect! So, now, comparing this to (frac{m}{n} - sqrt{k}), we have:(frac{m}{n} = frac{17}{4}) and (sqrt{k} = sqrt{18}).Therefore, (m = 17), (n = 4), and (k = 18).Now, the problem states that (m) and (n) are relatively prime. Let me check if 17 and 4 are coprime. Yes, 17 is a prime number and doesn't divide 4, so they are coprime.So, (k = 18), (m = 17), (n = 4). Therefore, (k + m + n = 18 + 17 + 4 = 39).Wait, before I conclude, let me just verify all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Expanded ((1 + sin t)(1 + cos t)) correctly to get (1 + sin t + cos t + sin t cos t = frac{9}{4}).2. Subtracted 1 to get (sin t + cos t + sin t cos t = frac{5}{4}).3. Let (S = sin t + cos t) and (P = sin t cos t), so (S + P = frac{5}{4}).4. Used the identity ((sin t + cos t)^2 = 1 + 2sin t cos t) to get (S^2 = 1 + 2P).5. Substituted (P = frac{5}{4} - S) into the equation to get (S^2 = 1 + 2(frac{5}{4} - S)), leading to (2S^2 + 4S - 7 = 0).6. Solved the quadratic equation and found (S = frac{-2 + 3sqrt{2}}{2}) as the valid solution.7. Calculated (P = frac{9 - 6sqrt{2}}{4}).8. Expanded ((1 - sin t)(1 - cos t)) to get (1 - S + P).9. Substituted (S) and (P) to compute (1 - S + P = frac{17 - 12sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{17}{4} - 3sqrt{2} = frac{17}{4} - sqrt{18}).10. Identified (k = 18), (m = 17), (n = 4), so (k + m + n = 39).Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in my calculations or reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 39.**Final Answer**boxed{39}"},{"question":"Given the line y=k(x+ sqrt {2}) and the hyperbola frac {x^{2}}{4}-y^{2}=1, determine the number of different values k can have such that the line and hyperbola intersect at exactly one point.- A: 1- B: 2- C: 3- D: 4","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of different values of ( k ) such that the line ( y = k(x + sqrt{2}) ) intersects the hyperbola ( frac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1 ) at exactly one point. The options are A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that to find the points of intersection between a line and a hyperbola, I can substitute the expression for ( y ) from the line into the hyperbola equation. That should give me a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ). If the line intersects the hyperbola at exactly one point, that quadratic equation should have exactly one solution. In other words, the discriminant of the quadratic equation should be zero.So, let's start by substituting ( y = k(x + sqrt{2}) ) into the hyperbola equation:[frac{x^2}{4} - [k(x + sqrt{2})]^2 = 1]Let me expand that:[frac{x^2}{4} - k^2(x + sqrt{2})^2 = 1]Expanding ( (x + sqrt{2})^2 ):[(x + sqrt{2})^2 = x^2 + 2sqrt{2}x + 2]So, substituting back:[frac{x^2}{4} - k^2(x^2 + 2sqrt{2}x + 2) = 1]Now, distribute the ( k^2 ):[frac{x^2}{4} - k^2x^2 - 2sqrt{2}k^2x - 2k^2 = 1]To make this easier, let's multiply every term by 4 to eliminate the fraction:[x^2 - 4k^2x^2 - 8sqrt{2}k^2x - 8k^2 = 4]Now, combine like terms:The ( x^2 ) terms: ( x^2 - 4k^2x^2 = (1 - 4k^2)x^2 )The ( x ) term: ( -8sqrt{2}k^2x )The constant terms: ( -8k^2 - 4 )So, the equation becomes:[(1 - 4k^2)x^2 - 8sqrt{2}k^2x - (8k^2 + 4) = 0]This is a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ): ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), where:- ( a = 1 - 4k^2 )- ( b = -8sqrt{2}k^2 )- ( c = -(8k^2 + 4) )For this quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant ( D ) is given by:[D = b^2 - 4ac]So, let's compute the discriminant:[D = (-8sqrt{2}k^2)^2 - 4(1 - 4k^2)(-(8k^2 + 4))]First, compute ( (-8sqrt{2}k^2)^2 ):[(-8sqrt{2}k^2)^2 = (8sqrt{2}k^2)^2 = (8)^2 times (sqrt{2})^2 times (k^2)^2 = 64 times 2 times k^4 = 128k^4]Next, compute ( 4(1 - 4k^2)(-(8k^2 + 4)) ):First, simplify the expression inside:[4(1 - 4k^2)(-8k^2 - 4) = 4 times (1 - 4k^2) times (-1)(8k^2 + 4) = -4(1 - 4k^2)(8k^2 + 4)]Let me compute ( (1 - 4k^2)(8k^2 + 4) ):[(1)(8k^2) + (1)(4) - (4k^2)(8k^2) - (4k^2)(4) = 8k^2 + 4 - 32k^4 - 16k^2]Combine like terms:[8k^2 - 16k^2 = -8k^2][-32k^4][+4]So, altogether:[-32k^4 - 8k^2 + 4]Multiply by -4:[-4(-32k^4 - 8k^2 + 4) = 128k^4 + 32k^2 - 16]So, now, the discriminant ( D ) is:[D = 128k^4 - (128k^4 + 32k^2 - 16)]Wait, no. Wait, the discriminant is:[D = 128k^4 - 4ac]But we computed ( 4ac ) as ( 128k^4 + 32k^2 - 16 ). So,[D = 128k^4 - (128k^4 + 32k^2 - 16) = 128k^4 - 128k^4 - 32k^2 + 16 = -32k^2 + 16]So, ( D = -32k^2 + 16 )Set discriminant equal to zero for exactly one solution:[-32k^2 + 16 = 0]Solve for ( k^2 ):[-32k^2 = -16][k^2 = frac{-16}{-32} = frac{1}{2}][k = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2}]Wait, so that gives two values of ( k ). But the options include up to 4. Hmm, maybe I missed something.Wait, let me go back. When I substituted ( y = k(x + sqrt{2}) ) into the hyperbola, I got a quadratic in ( x ). But what if the coefficient ( a ) of ( x^2 ) is zero? That would make the equation linear, which would also result in exactly one solution.So, let's check when ( a = 0 ):[1 - 4k^2 = 0][4k^2 = 1][k^2 = frac{1}{4}][k = pm frac{1}{2}]So, when ( k = pm frac{1}{2} ), the equation becomes linear, which would intersect the hyperbola at exactly one point. So, that's two more values of ( k ).Therefore, in total, we have four values of ( k ): ( pm frac{1}{2} ) and ( pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).Wait, but let me verify if these are all distinct. ( frac{1}{2} ) is approximately 0.5, and ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) is approximately 0.707, so they are distinct. So, four different values.But wait, let me double-check my discriminant calculation because earlier I thought it was two, but now it's four.Wait, when I set ( D = 0 ), I got ( k = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). Then, when ( a = 0 ), I got ( k = pm frac{1}{2} ). So, total four values.But let me think again: when ( a = 0 ), the equation becomes linear, which would intersect the hyperbola at exactly one point. But is that always the case? Because sometimes, a line can be parallel to an asymptote and not intersect, but in this case, since it's a linear equation after substitution, it should intersect at exactly one point.Wait, but let me check for ( k = frac{1}{2} ). Substitute back into the line equation: ( y = frac{1}{2}(x + sqrt{2}) ). Does this line intersect the hyperbola at exactly one point?Let me substitute ( k = frac{1}{2} ) into the original equation:[frac{x^2}{4} - left(frac{1}{2}(x + sqrt{2})right)^2 = 1]Compute ( left(frac{1}{2}(x + sqrt{2})right)^2 = frac{1}{4}(x^2 + 2sqrt{2}x + 2) )So, the equation becomes:[frac{x^2}{4} - frac{1}{4}x^2 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x - frac{1}{2} = 1]Simplify:[left(frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{4}right)x^2 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x - frac{1}{2} - 1 = 0][0x^2 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x - frac{3}{2} = 0][-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x - frac{3}{2} = 0][-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x = frac{3}{2}][x = frac{3}{2} times left(-frac{2}{sqrt{2}}right) = -frac{3}{sqrt{2}} = -frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}]So, yes, it gives exactly one solution for ( x ), which means one point of intersection. Similarly, for ( k = -frac{1}{2} ), it would also give one solution.Therefore, in total, we have four values of ( k ): ( pm frac{1}{2} ) and ( pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).Wait, but let me check if ( k = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) and ( k = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) are valid. Let's substitute ( k = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) into the discriminant equation:We had ( D = -32k^2 + 16 ). Plugging ( k = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ):[D = -32 left(frac{2}{4}right) + 16 = -32 times frac{1}{2} + 16 = -16 + 16 = 0]So, yes, discriminant is zero, meaning one solution.Similarly for ( k = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), since ( k^2 ) is same, discriminant is zero.Therefore, total four values: ( pm frac{1}{2} ) and ( pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).But wait, the options are A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4. So, the answer should be D:4.But let me think again: is there any possibility that some of these values might not actually result in a single intersection point? For example, maybe for some ( k ), the line is tangent to the hyperbola, and for others, it's parallel to an asymptote but still intersects once.Wait, in this case, when ( a = 0 ), the line is not necessarily parallel to an asymptote. The asymptotes of the hyperbola ( frac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1 ) are ( y = pm frac{x}{2} ). So, the slopes of the asymptotes are ( pm frac{1}{2} ).Wait, so when ( k = pm frac{1}{2} ), the line ( y = k(x + sqrt{2}) ) has the same slope as the asymptotes. But asymptotes themselves don't intersect the hyperbola, but lines with the same slope can intersect the hyperbola at one point if they are not the asymptotes themselves.Wait, but in our earlier substitution, when ( k = pm frac{1}{2} ), we got exactly one solution, meaning the line intersects the hyperbola at one point. So, these are valid.On the other hand, when ( k = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), the discriminant is zero, meaning the line is tangent to the hyperbola, so it touches at exactly one point.Therefore, all four values are valid, giving four different ( k ) values.But wait, let me check if ( k = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) is indeed a tangent. Let's substitute ( k = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) into the line equation and see if it touches the hyperbola at one point.Line: ( y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(x + sqrt{2}) )Substitute into hyperbola:[frac{x^2}{4} - left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(x + sqrt{2})right)^2 = 1]Compute ( left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(x + sqrt{2})right)^2 = frac{2}{4}(x + sqrt{2})^2 = frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2sqrt{2}x + 2) )So, the equation becomes:[frac{x^2}{4} - frac{1}{2}x^2 - sqrt{2}x - 1 = 1]Simplify:[left(frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{2}right)x^2 - sqrt{2}x - 1 - 1 = 0][-frac{1}{4}x^2 - sqrt{2}x - 2 = 0]Multiply by -4 to eliminate fractions:[x^2 + 4sqrt{2}x + 8 = 0]Compute discriminant:[D = (4sqrt{2})^2 - 4 times 1 times 8 = 32 - 32 = 0]So, discriminant is zero, meaning exactly one solution. Therefore, it's a tangent.Similarly, for ( k = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), the same would apply.Therefore, in total, we have four distinct values of ( k ): ( pm frac{1}{2} ) and ( pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).So, the answer should be D:4."},{"question":"The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence {a_n} is denoted as S_n. Given that S_3=a_2+5a_1 and a_7=2, then a_5=„ÄÄ„ÄÄ()A: dfrac{1}{2}B: -dfrac{1}{2}C: 2D: -2","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me read it again: The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence {a_n} is denoted as S_n. Given that S_3 = a_2 + 5a_1 and a_7 = 2, then a_5 is... and there are four options: A is 1/2, B is -1/2, C is 2, D is -2.Alright, so I need to find a_5. Let me recall what I know about geometric sequences. A geometric sequence has a common ratio, let's call it q, so each term is the previous term multiplied by q. So, a_n = a_1 * q^(n-1). The sum of the first n terms, S_n, is given by S_n = a_1*(1 - q^n)/(1 - q) if q ‚â† 1.Given that, let's parse the problem. First, S_3 = a_2 + 5a_1. So, S_3 is the sum of the first three terms, which would be a_1 + a_2 + a_3. But according to the problem, this sum equals a_2 + 5a_1. So, let me write that down:S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + 5a_1.Hmm, so if I subtract a_2 from both sides, I get a_1 + a_3 = 5a_1. That simplifies to a_3 = 4a_1. Since this is a geometric sequence, a_3 = a_1 * q^2. So, a_1 * q^2 = 4a_1. If I divide both sides by a_1 (assuming a_1 ‚â† 0, which it can't be in a geometric sequence), I get q^2 = 4. So, q is either 2 or -2.Alright, so the common ratio q is either 2 or -2. Now, the other condition given is a_7 = 2. Let's write that out: a_7 = a_1 * q^(6) = 2. So, a_1 = 2 / q^6.Now, since q^2 is 4, q^6 is (q^2)^3 = 4^3 = 64. So, a_1 = 2 / 64 = 1/32. So, the first term is 1/32.Now, we need to find a_5. Let's recall that a_5 = a_1 * q^(4). Since q^2 is 4, q^4 is (q^2)^2 = 4^2 = 16. So, a_5 = (1/32) * 16 = 16/32 = 1/2.Wait, but hold on, q could be either 2 or -2. If q is -2, then q^4 is still 16, because (-2)^4 is 16. So, regardless of whether q is 2 or -2, a_5 is 1/2. So, the answer should be A: 1/2.But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, S_3 = a_2 + 5a_1. I expanded S_3 as a_1 + a_2 + a_3 and set that equal to a_2 + 5a_1. Subtracting a_2 from both sides gives a_1 + a_3 = 5a_1, so a_3 = 4a_1. Since a_3 = a_1*q^2, that gives q^2 = 4. So, q is 2 or -2.Then, a_7 = a_1*q^6 = 2. Since q^6 is (q^2)^3 = 4^3 = 64, so a_1 = 2/64 = 1/32. Then, a_5 = a_1*q^4. Since q^4 is (q^2)^2 = 16, so a_5 = (1/32)*16 = 1/2. That seems correct.Wait, but in the initial step, when I set S_3 = a_2 + 5a_1, I wrote S_3 as a_1 + a_2 + a_3. Let me confirm that. Yes, because S_n is the sum of the first n terms, so S_3 is a_1 + a_2 + a_3. So, that part is correct.Another thing to check: when I solved for a_1, I assumed a_1 ‚â† 0, which is valid because in a geometric sequence, the first term can't be zero. Also, when I calculated a_5, I used q^4, which is correct because a_5 is the fifth term, so exponent is 4.Wait, but let me think about the common ratio. If q is negative, does that affect anything else? For example, when I calculated a_1, I used q^6, which is positive regardless of q being 2 or -2, so that's fine. Similarly, q^4 is positive as well. So, whether q is 2 or -2, a_5 is positive 1/2.So, yeah, I think my reasoning is solid. The answer should be A: 1/2.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Brenda starts with 7 Skittles.

I need to find the range of the independent variable x. Hmm, okay, let me think about what that means. The independent variable is x, and I guess the range of x would be all the possible values that x can take such that the function is defined, right?Alright, so since this is a square root function, I remember that the expression inside the square root has to be greater than or equal to zero. Because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, that means 4 minus 2x has to be greater than or equal to zero.Let me write that down: 4 - 2x ‚â• 0. Now, I need to solve this inequality for x. Okay, so first, I can subtract 4 from both sides. That would give me -2x ‚â• -4. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 4 minus 2x is greater than or equal to zero. If I subtract 4 from both sides, I get -2x ‚â• -4. Yeah, that seems correct.Now, I need to solve for x. So, I have -2x ‚â• -4. To isolate x, I should divide both sides by -2. But wait, I remember that when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, dividing both sides by -2 would change the ‚â• to ‚â§.Let me do that: (-2x)/(-2) ‚â§ (-4)/(-2). Simplifying that, I get x ‚â§ 2. Okay, so x has to be less than or equal to 2. That means the range of x is all real numbers less than or equal to 2.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If x is 2, then 4 minus 2 times 2 is 4 minus 4, which is 0. The square root of 0 is 0, which is fine. If x is less than 2, say x is 1, then 4 minus 2 times 1 is 2, and the square root of 2 is a real number. If x is 3, which is greater than 2, then 4 minus 2 times 3 is 4 minus 6, which is -2. The square root of -2 isn't a real number, so x can't be 3. That makes sense.So, putting it all together, the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative, which leads to x being less than or equal to 2. Therefore, the range of the independent variable x in the function y equals the square root of (4 minus 2x) is all real numbers x such that x is less than or equal to 2.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that the expression under the square root must be non-negative, setting up the inequality, solving for x, and remembering to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number. Yeah, that all checks out."},{"question":"A sphere is circumscribed around a regular triangular prism, the height of which is twice the side of the base. How does its volume compare to the volume of the prism?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a sphere circumscribed around a regular triangular prism. The prism has a height that's twice the side length of its base. I need to compare the volume of the sphere to the volume of the prism. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the prism. A regular triangular prism has two congruent equilateral triangles as its bases, and three rectangles connecting the corresponding sides. The height of the prism is the distance between these two triangular bases. The problem says the height is twice the side of the base, so if the side length of the triangle is, say, 'a', then the height 'h' of the prism is 2a.Now, I need to find the volume of both the sphere and the prism. Let me start with the prism because that seems straightforward.The volume of a prism is generally the area of the base times the height. Since the base is an equilateral triangle with side length 'a', I can calculate its area. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (‚àö3/4) * a¬≤. So, the area of the base is (‚àö3/4) * a¬≤. Then, the volume of the prism should be this area multiplied by the height, which is 2a. So, Volume_prism = (‚àö3/4) * a¬≤ * 2a = (‚àö3/2) * a¬≥.Alright, that's the prism's volume. Now, onto the sphere. The sphere is circumscribed around the prism, meaning the prism is inscribed in the sphere. So, all the vertices of the prism lie on the surface of the sphere. To find the volume of the sphere, I need its radius. Once I have the radius, I can use the formula Volume_sphere = (4/3)œÄR¬≥.To find the radius of the sphere, I need to figure out the distance from the center of the sphere to any of the prism's vertices. Since the prism is regular and symmetric, the center of the sphere should coincide with the centroid of the prism.Let me think about the geometry here. The prism has two triangular bases and three rectangular faces. The centroid of the prism is located at the midpoint along the height of the prism. So, if the height is 2a, the centroid is at a distance of 'a' from each base.Now, considering one of the vertices of the prism, it's located at a corner of one of the triangular bases. The distance from the centroid to this vertex will be the radius of the sphere. To find this distance, I can model it in a coordinate system.Let me place the prism in a coordinate system such that the centroid is at the origin (0, 0, 0). Then, the two triangular bases are located at z = a and z = -a. Wait, actually, since the height is 2a, the distance from the centroid to each base is 'a', so the bases are at z = a and z = -a.Now, let me consider one of the vertices of the upper base (z = a). Let's pick a vertex with coordinates (x, y, a). Since it's an equilateral triangle, the coordinates can be determined based on the side length 'a'.In an equilateral triangle, the coordinates of the vertices can be set as follows for simplicity: one vertex at (0, 0, a), another at (a, 0, a), and the third at (a/2, (‚àö3/2)a, a). Similarly, the lower base at z = -a will have vertices at (0, 0, -a), (a, 0, -a), and (a/2, (‚àö3/2)a, -a).Wait, actually, if I place the centroid at the origin, the coordinates might be slightly different because the centroid of the triangular base isn't at (0, 0, a) but rather shifted. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my coordinate system.Let me recall that the centroid of an equilateral triangle is at a distance of (a‚àö3)/3 from each vertex. So, if I place the centroid of the upper base at (0, 0, a), then the vertices would be located at (a/2, (‚àö3/6)a, a), (-a/2, (‚àö3/6)a, a), and (0, -(‚àö3/3)a, a). Similarly, the lower base would be at (0, 0, -a) with vertices at (a/2, (‚àö3/6)a, -a), (-a/2, (‚àö3/6)a, -a), and (0, -(‚àö3/3)a, -a).Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should use a different approach. Instead of placing the centroid at the origin, perhaps I can calculate the distance from the centroid of the prism to one of its vertices using geometric properties.The centroid of the prism is equidistant from all its vertices. So, if I can find the distance from the centroid to one vertex, that will be the radius R of the sphere.Let me consider a vertex of the prism. Let's say the prism has side length 'a' and height '2a'. The centroid is located at the midpoint of the height, so it's at a distance of 'a' from each base.Now, in the base, which is an equilateral triangle, the centroid is located at a distance of (a‚àö3)/3 from each vertex. So, in the base, the distance from the centroid to a vertex is (a‚àö3)/3.Therefore, the distance from the centroid of the prism to a vertex can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. The centroid is 'a' units away along the height and (a‚àö3)/3 units away in the base. So, the radius R is the square root of (a¬≤ + ( (a‚àö3)/3 )¬≤).Calculating that: R = ‚àö[a¬≤ + ( (a‚àö3)/3 )¬≤] = ‚àö[a¬≤ + ( (3a¬≤)/9 )] = ‚àö[a¬≤ + (a¬≤/3)] = ‚àö[(4a¬≤)/3] = (2a)/‚àö3.So, the radius R of the sphere is (2a)/‚àö3.Now, the volume of the sphere is (4/3)œÄR¬≥. Plugging in R = (2a)/‚àö3:Volume_sphere = (4/3)œÄ * ( (2a)/‚àö3 )¬≥ = (4/3)œÄ * (8a¬≥)/(3‚àö3) = (32œÄa¬≥)/(9‚àö3).Wait, let me double-check that calculation. (2a/‚àö3) cubed is (8a¬≥)/(3‚àö3). Then, multiplying by (4/3)œÄ gives (32œÄa¬≥)/(9‚àö3). Yeah, that seems right.Now, the volume of the prism was (‚àö3/2)a¬≥. So, to find the ratio of the sphere's volume to the prism's volume, I can divide Volume_sphere by Volume_prism:Ratio = (32œÄa¬≥)/(9‚àö3) √∑ (‚àö3/2 a¬≥) = (32œÄ)/(9‚àö3) * (2/‚àö3) = (64œÄ)/(9*3) = (64œÄ)/27.Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Dividing by (‚àö3/2) is the same as multiplying by 2/‚àö3. So, (32œÄ)/(9‚àö3) * (2/‚àö3) = (64œÄ)/(9*3) because ‚àö3 * ‚àö3 is 3. So, yes, 64œÄ/27.So, the volume of the sphere is (64œÄ/27) times the volume of the prism. That means the sphere's volume is approximately 7.36 times the prism's volume, but since the question asks for the ratio, it's better to leave it in terms of œÄ.Wait, but let me just confirm if my radius calculation was correct. I considered the distance from the centroid of the prism to a vertex as the radius. The centroid is at the midpoint of the height, so it's 'a' units from each base. In the base, the centroid is (a‚àö3)/3 from each vertex. So, the distance from the centroid of the prism to a vertex is ‚àö(a¬≤ + (a‚àö3/3)¬≤) = ‚àö(a¬≤ + a¬≤/3) = ‚àö(4a¬≤/3) = 2a/‚àö3. That seems correct.And then the volume of the sphere is (4/3)œÄ*(2a/‚àö3)¬≥. Let me compute that again: (2a/‚àö3)¬≥ is 8a¬≥/(3‚àö3). Multiply by (4/3)œÄ: (32œÄa¬≥)/(9‚àö3). Then, the prism's volume is (‚àö3/2)a¬≥. So, the ratio is (32œÄa¬≥)/(9‚àö3) divided by (‚àö3/2)a¬≥, which simplifies to (32œÄ)/(9‚àö3) * (2/‚àö3) = (64œÄ)/(27). Yep, that's consistent.So, the volume of the sphere is (64œÄ)/27 times the volume of the prism. So, the sphere is larger than the prism by that factor.I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:1. Volume of prism: (‚àö3/2)a¬≥.2. Radius of sphere: 2a/‚àö3.3. Volume of sphere: (4/3)œÄ*(2a/‚àö3)¬≥ = (32œÄa¬≥)/(9‚àö3).4. Ratio: Volume_sphere / Volume_prism = (32œÄ)/(9‚àö3) * (2/‚àö3) = 64œÄ/27.Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the sphere's volume is 64œÄ/27 times the prism's volume."},{"question":"A train usually travels at a certain speed and crosses a pole in 7 seconds. The length of the train is 140 meters.

Since Adelaide bought 30 ducks, Ephraim must have bought half of that, which is 15 ducks.Next, Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton. If Ephraim bought 15 ducks, then Kolton bought 15 + 45 = 60 ducks.Now, I'll calculate the total number of ducks bought by all three students: 30 (Adelaide) + 15 (Ephraim) + 60 (Kolton) = 105 ducks.The problem states that the total number of ducks must be divisible by 9.

The coordinates are given as OA = (1, -3), OB = (2, -1), and OC = (k+1, k-2). The question is asking for the value of k such that points A, B, and C cannot form a triangle. The options are A: -2, B: 1/2, C: 1, D: -1.Okay, so first, I need to recall when three points cannot form a triangle. I think that happens when the three points are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. So, if points A, B, and C are collinear, they can't form a triangle because all three would be on the same line, making the area of the triangle zero.So, to check if three points are collinear, I can use the concept of vectors. If vectors AB and AC are scalar multiples of each other, then the points are collinear. Alternatively, I can use the slope method: if the slope between A and B is the same as the slope between B and C, then they are collinear.Let me try both methods to see which one is easier.First, let's find the vectors AB and AC.Vector AB is OB - OA, which is (2 - 1, -1 - (-3)) = (1, 2).Vector AC is OC - OA, which is (k+1 - 1, k-2 - (-3)) = (k, k + 1).So, vector AB is (1, 2) and vector AC is (k, k + 1).For these vectors to be collinear, AC must be a scalar multiple of AB. That means there exists some scalar t such that:(k, k + 1) = t*(1, 2)Which gives us two equations:1. k = t*1 => t = k2. k + 1 = t*2Substituting t from the first equation into the second equation:k + 1 = 2kSubtract k from both sides:1 = kSo, k = 1.Hmm, that seems straightforward. So, k should be 1 for the points to be collinear, meaning they can't form a triangle.Let me double-check using the slope method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, find the slope between A and B.Slope AB = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (-1 - (-3))/(2 - 1) = (2)/1 = 2.Now, find the slope between B and C.Coordinates of C are (k+1, k-2). So, slope BC = (k - 2 - (-1))/(k + 1 - 2) = (k - 1)/(k - 1).Wait, that's interesting. So, slope BC = (k - 1)/(k - 1). If k ‚â† 1, this simplifies to 1. But if k = 1, then both numerator and denominator are zero, which is undefined.So, if k ‚â† 1, slope BC is 1, which is different from slope AB, which is 2. Therefore, the points are not collinear unless k = 1.But when k = 1, slope BC is undefined because both numerator and denominator are zero. That means point C coincides with point B when k = 1, right?Wait, let me check that.If k = 1, then OC = (1 + 1, 1 - 2) = (2, -1), which is exactly the same as point B. So, points A, B, and C would actually be points A, B, and B, which are not three distinct points, hence they can't form a triangle.So, both methods lead me to k = 1.But wait, in the first method, I found k = 1 by setting vectors AC and AB as scalar multiples, and in the second method, I saw that when k = 1, point C coincides with point B, making them not form a triangle.Therefore, the correct answer should be k = 1, which is option C.I think that makes sense. Let me just visualize it to be sure.If k = 1, then point C is at (2, -1), which is the same as point B. So, points A, B, and C would be A(1, -3), B(2, -1), and C(2, -1). So, effectively, we have two distinct points, A and B, and C is just another name for B. Therefore, they can't form a triangle because a triangle requires three non-collinear, distinct points.Alternatively, if k ‚â† 1, then point C is different from B, and since the slopes between A-B and B-C are different, the points are not collinear, so they can form a triangle.Hence, the value of k that makes points A, B, and C unable to form a triangle is k = 1.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"a merchant marks his goods up by 20 % and then offers a discount of 5 % on the marked price . what % profit does the merchant make after the discount ?","answer":"First, I need to determine the marked price by increasing the cost price by 20%.Next, I'll calculate the discount amount based on the marked price.After that, I'll find the selling price by subtracting the discount from the marked price.Finally, I'll calculate the profit percentage by comparing the profit to the original cost price."},{"question":"Given that |overrightarrow{a}| = 1, |overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{2}, and overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b}, find |overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}| as follows:A: sqrt{2}B: sqrt{3}C: 2D: 2sqrt{2}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the magnitude of the vector sum of two vectors, a and b.

The options provided are A: sqrt(2), B: sqrt(3), C: 2, and D: 2 sqrt(2). Alright, let's start by recalling what it means for two vectors to be perpendicular. If two vectors are perpendicular, that means they form a right angle with each other, which also implies that their dot product is zero. So, vector a dotted with vector b equals zero. That's a key point because when we're dealing with vector addition, especially when finding the magnitude of the resultant vector, the dot product comes into play.Now, the formula for the magnitude of the sum of two vectors is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of their magnitudes plus twice their dot product. In mathematical terms, it's |a + b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2(a ¬∑ b)). Since we know that a and b are perpendicular, their dot product is zero, which simplifies the formula to |a + b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2).Given that |a| is 1 and |b| is sqrt(2), let's plug those values into the formula. So, |a|^2 is 1 squared, which is 1, and |b|^2 is (sqrt(2)) squared, which is 2. Adding those together gives us 1 + 2 = 3. Taking the square root of 3 gives us sqrt(3). Wait, let me double-check that. If I have a right triangle where one leg is length 1 and the other leg is length sqrt(2), then the hypotenuse should be sqrt(1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2) = sqrt(1 + 2) = sqrt(3). That makes sense because in a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies, and since the vectors are perpendicular, the triangle formed by them is a right triangle.So, putting it all together, the magnitude of the vector sum a + b is sqrt(3), which corresponds to option B. I think that's solid. The key steps were recognizing that perpendicular vectors have a dot product of zero, applying the formula for the magnitude of the sum of two vectors, and simplifying using the given magnitudes.

Let me try to figure it out step by step. The hyperbola is centered at the origin, and its focus is on the x-axis. That means it's a standard hyperbola opening left and right, right? So its equation should be something like (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1). Now, one of its asymptotes forms an angle Œ± with the x-axis, and Œ± is between œÄ/4 and œÄ/3. I need to find the range of the hyperbola's eccentricity. Hmm, eccentricity... I remember that for hyperbolas, eccentricity e is greater than 1, and it's defined as (e = frac{c}{a}), where c is the distance from the center to each focus, and a is the distance from the center to each vertex.But how does the angle Œ± come into play? Well, the asymptotes of a hyperbola are the lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches. For a standard hyperbola like this, the asymptotes are given by the equations (y = pm frac{b}{a}x). So, the slope of the asymptote is (frac{b}{a}). Since one of the asymptotes forms an angle Œ± with the x-axis, that means the slope is equal to the tangent of Œ±. So, (tan alpha = frac{b}{a}). That makes sense. So, if I can find the range of (tan alpha), I can find the range of (frac{b}{a}), and from there, maybe find the range of the eccentricity.Given that Œ± is between œÄ/4 and œÄ/3, let me compute the tangent of those angles. I know that (tan frac{pi}{4} = 1) and (tan frac{pi}{3} = sqrt{3}). So, since Œ± is between œÄ/4 and œÄ/3, (tan alpha) must be between 1 and (sqrt{3}). Therefore, (1 < frac{b}{a} < sqrt{3}).Okay, so now I have (1 < frac{b}{a} < sqrt{3}). I need to relate this to the eccentricity e. I remember that for hyperbolas, (c^2 = a^2 + b^2). So, (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}). Therefore, (e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a} = sqrt{1 + left(frac{b}{a}right)^2}).So, if I let (k = frac{b}{a}), then (e = sqrt{1 + k^2}). Since (1 < k < sqrt{3}), let's substitute those values into the equation for e.First, when (k = 1), (e = sqrt{1 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}). When (k = sqrt{3}), (e = sqrt{1 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2). But wait, since k is between 1 and (sqrt{3}), not including the endpoints, does that mean e is between (sqrt{2}) and 2? Let me think. If k is greater than 1, then (k^2) is greater than 1, so (1 + k^2) is greater than 2, so e is greater than (sqrt{2}). Similarly, since k is less than (sqrt{3}), (k^2) is less than 3, so (1 + k^2) is less than 4, so e is less than 2. Therefore, the eccentricity e must be between (sqrt{2}) and 2. So, the range is ((sqrt{2}, 2)). Looking back at the options, that's option B.Wait, let me double-check. If Œ± is between œÄ/4 and œÄ/3, then the slope of the asymptote is between 1 and (sqrt{3}), so (frac{b}{a}) is between 1 and (sqrt{3}). Then, (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}), so (c) is between (sqrt{2}a) and (2a). Therefore, (e = frac{c}{a}) is between (sqrt{2}) and 2. Yep, that seems right.I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing the relationship between the angle Œ±, the slope of the asymptote, and then connecting that to the eccentricity through the standard hyperbola relationships. So, I feel confident that the answer is B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"How many three-digit prime numbers can be formed by choosing three different digits from the set {1, 3, 7, 9}, using one of them as the hundreds digit, another as the tens digit, and the remaining one as the units digit?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many three-digit prime numbers can be formed by choosing three different digits from the set {1, 3, 7, 9}. Each digit has to be used exactly once, with one as the hundreds digit, another as the tens digit, and the last one as the units digit. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First off, I know that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, for a three-digit number to be prime, it shouldn't be divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. That means I need to check each possible three-digit number formed by these digits to see if it's prime.Now, the set of digits I can use is {1, 3, 7, 9}. Since I need to form three-digit numbers, I have to choose three different digits from this set. That means I can't repeat any digit in a single number. So, for example, 113 wouldn't be allowed because the digit '1' is repeated.Let me figure out how many such three-digit numbers I can form. Since there are four digits and I need to choose three without repetition, the number of permutations is 4P3, which is 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 = 24. So, there are 24 possible three-digit numbers I can make with these digits. But not all of them will be prime, so I need to check each one.Before I go into checking each number, maybe I can eliminate some possibilities based on divisibility rules. For example, if a number ends with an even digit, it's divisible by 2 and hence not prime (except for 2 itself, but since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, that's irrelevant here). Similarly, if a number ends with 5, it's divisible by 5 and hence not prime. But in our set, the digits are 1, 3, 7, and 9, none of which are even or 5, so actually, none of the numbers we form will be divisible by 2 or 5. That's good news because it means all 24 numbers are candidates for being prime.Wait, but actually, that's not entirely true. Even though the digits themselves aren't even or 5, the number as a whole could still be divisible by other numbers. For example, 111 is divisible by 3, but in our case, we can't have repeating digits, so 111 isn't an option. But still, other numbers might be divisible by 3, 7, 11, etc.Another divisibility rule I remember is for 3: if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. So, let's check the sum of our digits: 1 + 3 + 7 + 9 = 20. Wait, but we're only using three digits at a time, so the sum will vary depending on which three digits we choose. Let me calculate the possible sums.If I choose 1, 3, 7: sum is 11If I choose 1, 3, 9: sum is 13If I choose 1, 7, 9: sum is 17If I choose 3, 7, 9: sum is 19Hmm, all these sums are not divisible by 3, so none of the numbers formed will be divisible by 3. That's another helpful elimination.What about divisibility by 7? That's a bit trickier, but I might have to check each number individually for that. Similarly, for 11, the rule is that if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero), then the number is divisible by 11. Let's see if any of our numbers might fall into that category.But since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, the rule simplifies a bit. For a number ABC (where A, B, C are digits), the difference (A + C) - B should be a multiple of 11. Let's see if any of our numbers satisfy that.For example, take 137: (1 + 7) - 3 = 5, which isn't a multiple of 11. 139: (1 + 9) - 3 = 7, not a multiple. 173: (1 + 3) - 7 = -3, not a multiple. 179: (1 + 9) - 7 = 3, not a multiple. 193: (1 + 3) - 9 = -5, not a multiple. 197: (1 + 7) - 9 = -1, not a multiple.Similarly, checking 317: (3 + 7) - 1 = 9, not a multiple. 319: (3 + 9) - 1 = 11, which is a multiple of 11. Oh, so 319 is divisible by 11. That means 319 is not prime. Interesting, so I can eliminate 319 from my list.Continuing this way might help me eliminate a few more numbers, but it's going to be time-consuming. Maybe I should just list out all 24 permutations and then check each one for primality.Let me list all the permutations of the digits {1, 3, 7, 9} taken three at a time:1. 1372. 1393. 1734. 1795. 1936. 1977. 3178. 3199. 37110. 37911. 39112. 39713. 71314. 71915. 73116. 73917. 79118. 79319. 91320. 91721. 93122. 937Wait, that's only 22 numbers. Did I miss two? Let me recount. Oh, I see, when I listed them, I only went up to 22. Maybe because some permutations are duplicates or something? Wait, no, each permutation is unique. Let me check again.Actually, 4P3 is 24, so I must have missed two. Let me see:From the set {1,3,7,9}, the permutations of three digits are:Starting with 1:137, 139, 173, 179, 193, 197Starting with 3:317, 319, 371, 379, 391, 397Starting with 7:713, 719, 731, 739, 791, 793Starting with 9:913, 917, 931, 937, 971, 973Wait, in my initial list, I only went up to 937, which is 22 numbers. So, I missed 971 and 973. Let me add those:23. 97124. 973Okay, now I have all 24 permutations. Good.Now, I need to check each of these 24 numbers to see if they're prime. Let's go through them one by one.1. 137: I think this is a prime number. Let me check. It doesn't end with an even digit or 5, so not divisible by 2 or 5. Let's see if it's divisible by 3: 1+3+7=11, which isn't divisible by 3. Next, check divisibility by 7: 137 √∑ 7 is approximately 19.57, not an integer.

So, 973 is divisible by 7, hence not prime.Okay, so after checking all 24 permutations, I found that some of them are not prime because they're divisible by smaller primes like 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Specifically, the non-prime numbers I found are: 319, 371, 391, 713, 731, 791, 793, 913, 917, 931, 973.Let me count how many primes I have left. From the initial 24, I eliminated 11 numbers as non-prime. So, 24 - 11 = 13 primes? Wait, let me recount the primes I identified:1. 1372. 1393. 1734. 1795. 1936. 1977. 3178. 3799. 39710. 71911. 73912. 93713. 971Yes, that's 13 primes. Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 22, but that seems incorrect because I only found 13 primes. Did I make a mistake somewhere?Wait, no, I think I miscounted earlier. Let me go back to my initial list of 24 numbers and see which ones are prime:From the list:1. 137 - prime2. 139 - prime3. 173 - prime4. 179 - prime5. 193 - prime6. 197 - prime7. 317 - prime8. 319 - not prime9. 371 - not prime10. 379 - prime11. 391 - not prime12. 397 - prime13. 713 - not prime14. 719 - prime15. 731 - not prime16. 739 - prime17. 791 - not prime18. 793 - not prime19. 913 - not prime20. 917 - not prime21. 931 - not prime22. 937 - prime23. 971 - prime24. 973 - not primeSo, counting the primes:1. 1372. 1393. 1734. 1795. 1936. 1977. 3178. 3799. 39710. 71911. 73912. 93713. 971That's 13 primes. So, my initial thought of 22 was wrong. It seems the correct number is 13.Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the user mentioned that the assistant concluded 22, but upon re-examining, it's clear that only 13 are primes. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial thought process.Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the non-primes. Let me list the non-primes again:8. 3199. 37111. 39113. 71315. 73117. 79118. 79319. 91320. 91721. 93124. 973That's 11 non-primes, so 24 - 11 = 13 primes. So, the correct answer should be 13.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user's assistant concluded 22, but that seems incorrect. Maybe the user's assistant made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I missed some primes.Let me double-check the numbers I marked as non-prime to ensure they're indeed not prime.8. 319: Divisible by 11 (319 √∑11=29), correct.9. 371: Divisible by 7 (371 √∑7=53), correct.11. 391: Divisible by 17 (391 √∑17=23), correct.13. 713: Divisible by 23 (713 √∑23=31), correct.15. 731: Divisible by 17 (731 √∑17=43), correct.17. 791: Divisible by 7 (791 √∑7=113), correct.18. 793: Divisible by 13 (793 √∑13=61), correct.19. 913: Divisible by 11 (913 √∑11=83), correct.20. 917: Divisible by 7 (917 √∑7=131), correct.21. 931: Divisible by 7 (931 √∑7=133), correct.24. 973: Divisible by 7 (973 √∑7=139), correct.All these non-primes are correctly identified. So, the primes are indeed 13 in number.Wait, but I just realized something. When I listed the permutations, I included numbers like 971 and 973, which are valid three-digit numbers, but when I initially thought of the problem, I might have considered that the hundreds digit can't be 1 because it's the smallest digit, but no, in the problem statement, it's allowed as long as it's different from the other digits. So, numbers like 137 are valid.But wait, in my initial list, I had 24 numbers, but when I counted the primes, I got 13. However, I think I might have missed some primes because when I listed the primes, I only got 13, but I recall that some sources say there are 22 such primes. Maybe I made a mistake in my checking.Let me go back and check each number again to ensure I didn't miss any primes.Starting from the top:1. 137 - prime2. 139 - prime3. 173 - prime4. 179 - prime5. 193 - prime6. 197 - prime7. 317 - prime8. 319 - not prime9. 371 - not prime10. 379 - prime11. 391 - not prime12. 397 - prime13. 713 - not prime14. 719 - prime15. 731 - not prime16. 739 - prime17. 791 - not prime18. 793 - not prime19. 913 - not prime20. 917 - not prime21. 931 - not prime22. 937 - prime23. 971 - prime24. 973 - not primeYes, that's 13 primes. So, I think the correct answer is 13, not 22. Maybe the initial assistant made a mistake in counting or in checking the primality of some numbers.Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for leading zeros, but in this case, since we're using digits {1,3,7,9}, there are no zeros, so that's not an issue.Wait, another thought: maybe the problem allows for digits to be repeated, but the user specified \\"choosing three different digits,\\" so repetition isn't allowed. So, my initial approach was correct.Therefore, I conclude that there are 13 three-digit prime numbers that can be formed using the digits {1,3,7,9} without repetition."},{"question":"If two numbers differ only in their _______, then we say one number is the opposite number of the other.","answer":"Okay, so I have this math problem here: \\"If two numbers differ only in their _______, then we say one number is the opposite number of the other.\\" I need to figure out what word fits in the blank. Hmm, let's think about what opposite numbers mean.I remember that opposite numbers are numbers that are the same distance from zero on the number line but in opposite directions. For example, 5 and -5 are opposites because they are both five units away from zero but one is positive and the other is negative. So, what's different between them? Their signs. One is positive, and the other is negative.Wait, is there anything else that could be different? Like, maybe their magnitudes? No, because their magnitudes are the same; that's why they're called opposites. It's not about their size or value, but rather their direction from zero. So, it must be their signs that are different.Let me double-check. If I take another pair, like 3 and -3, they are opposites. They have the same absolute value but different signs. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the only thing that differs between them is their sign. Therefore, the blank should be filled with \\"sign.\\"I don't think it's anything else like \\"value\\" because their values are essentially the same in magnitude. It's specifically about their sign. So, I'm pretty confident the answer is \\"sign.\\""},{"question":"Inside a large triangle with a perimeter of 120, several line segments were drawn, dividing it into nine smaller triangles, as shown in the figure. It turned out that the perimeters of all nine smaller triangles are equal. What can their perimeters be? List all possible options.The perimeter of a shape is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a large triangle with a perimeter of 120, and inside it, there are several line segments drawn that divide it into nine smaller triangles. The key thing is that all nine of these smaller triangles have equal perimeters. I need to figure out what those perimeters can be.First, I need to visualize this. There's a big triangle, and it's been split into nine smaller triangles. I'm assuming these smaller triangles are all similar or maybe congruent? But the problem doesn't specify that, just that their perimeters are equal. So, they might not be congruent, but their perimeters are the same.Since the large triangle has a perimeter of 120, and it's divided into nine smaller triangles, I wonder how the perimeters of the smaller triangles relate to the large one. If I think about perimeters, they add up the lengths of all sides. So, when we divide the large triangle into smaller ones, some of the sides of the smaller triangles are internal, meaning they are shared between two smaller triangles, and some are on the edge, contributing to the large triangle's perimeter.Let me denote the perimeter of each small triangle as P. Since there are nine small triangles, the total sum of all their perimeters would be 9P. However, this total includes both the internal sides and the external sides of the large triangle.Now, the perimeter of the large triangle is 120, which is the sum of its three sides. When we divide it into smaller triangles, the internal sides are counted twice in the total perimeter of the small triangles because each internal side is shared by two small triangles. So, if I let S be the total length of all internal sides, then the total perimeter of all small triangles would be 120 (the perimeter of the large triangle) plus 2S (since each internal side is counted twice). Therefore, 9P = 120 + 2S.But I don't know what S is. Maybe I can find another relationship. Since the large triangle is divided into nine smaller triangles, perhaps the number of internal sides can be determined based on the number of divisions. If there are nine small triangles, how many internal sides are there?In a triangulation, the number of edges can be related to the number of triangles. For a planar graph, Euler's formula states that V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. In this case, F would be 10 (the nine small triangles plus the outer face). But I'm not sure if this is the right approach.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the fact that each internal side is shared by two small triangles, so the total number of internal sides would be (9P - 120)/2. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Wait, maybe there's a simpler way. If all nine small triangles have equal perimeters, then perhaps the large triangle is divided in such a way that each side of the large triangle is divided into three equal parts. So, each side of the large triangle is 120 divided by 3, which is 40. But that might not necessarily be the case.Alternatively, if the large triangle is divided into nine smaller triangles by drawing lines parallel to the sides, creating a grid of smaller triangles. In that case, each side of the large triangle would be divided into three equal segments, and the smaller triangles would be similar to the large one. If that's the case, then the ratio of similarity would be 1:3, so the perimeter of each small triangle would be 120 divided by 3, which is 40.But I'm not sure if the division is necessarily by parallel lines. The problem doesn't specify that. It just says several line segments were drawn, dividing it into nine smaller triangles. So, it could be any kind of division, not necessarily parallel.However, since all nine small triangles have equal perimeters, the division must be such that each small triangle has sides that contribute equally to the perimeter. Maybe the large triangle is divided into three smaller triangles along each side, creating a grid of nine triangles.Let me think about this. If I divide each side of the large triangle into three equal parts, and then connect these division points with lines parallel to the sides, I would end up with nine smaller triangles, each similar to the large one. In this case, each small triangle would have a perimeter of 40, as I thought earlier.But is this the only possibility? What if the division isn't parallel? Could the perimeters still be equal?If the division isn't parallel, the small triangles might not be similar, but their perimeters could still be equal if the lengths of their sides are arranged in such a way that the sum of their sides is the same for each triangle.But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, the problem states that the perimeters are equal, which suggests a symmetrical division. The most straightforward symmetrical division would be dividing each side into three equal parts and drawing lines parallel to the sides, resulting in nine smaller triangles each with a perimeter of 40.Therefore, I think the perimeter of each small triangle must be 40."},{"question":"Six years ago, John was four times as old as his sister Emma.

What is the minimum number of games that must be played so that among any three teams, there are two that have already played against each other?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a national football championship with 20 teams. The question is asking for the minimum number of games that must be played so that among any three teams, there are two that have already played against each other. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.First, let me understand the requirement. We need to ensure that in any group of three teams, at least two have played each other. So, this is a kind of connectivity condition in the tournament. If I think of the teams as nodes in a graph, and each game as an edge between two nodes, then the condition is that there are no three nodes that are all disconnected from each other. In graph theory terms, this means the graph doesn't contain an independent set of size three.An independent set is a set of vertices with no edges connecting them. So, we need to make sure that our graph doesn't have any such set of three vertices. This property is related to something called the Ramsey number. Specifically, the Ramsey number R(3, n) tells us the minimum number of vertices needed so that any graph or its complement contains a particular structure. But I'm not sure if Ramsey numbers are directly applicable here, or if there's another way to approach this.Maybe I can think about it in terms of graph density. If the graph is dense enough, it won't have large independent sets. So, perhaps I need to calculate the minimum number of edges required to ensure that the graph doesn't have an independent set of size three.I remember that Tur√°n's theorem might be useful here. Tur√°n's theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. But wait, we're dealing with independent sets, not complete subgraphs. However, there's a connection because the complement of a graph with no independent set of size three would have no triangle (a complete subgraph of size three). So, maybe Tur√°n's theorem can help indirectly.Tur√°n's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph without a (r+1)-clique is given by a certain formula. In our case, if we consider the complement graph, which should have no triangle, then Tur√°n's theorem would give us the maximum number of edges the complement graph can have. Subtracting that from the total number of possible edges would give us the minimum number of edges needed in the original graph to ensure no independent set of size three.Let me write that down. The total number of possible edges in a graph with 20 teams is C(20, 2) = 190. If the complement graph has no triangle, then according to Tur√°n's theorem, the maximum number of edges it can have is given by:[ text{Tur√°n number} = left(1 - frac{1}{r}right) frac{n^2}{2} ]For our case, since we're avoiding a triangle, which is a 3-clique, r would be 2. So, plugging in n = 20 and r = 2:[ text{Tur√°n number} = left(1 - frac{1}{2}right) frac{20^2}{2} = frac{1}{2} times frac{400}{2} = frac{1}{2} times 200 = 100 ]So, the complement graph can have at most 100 edges without containing a triangle. Therefore, the original graph must have at least 190 - 100 = 90 edges to ensure that the complement doesn't have a triangle, which in turn means the original graph doesn't have an independent set of size three.Wait, let me make sure I got that right. If the complement graph has no triangle, then the original graph has no independent set of size three. Yes, that makes sense because an independent set in the original graph corresponds to a clique in the complement graph. So, if the complement graph has no triangle (which is a 3-clique), then the original graph has no independent set of size three.Therefore, the minimum number of edges required in the original graph is 90. So, the minimum number of games that must be played is 90.But just to double-check, let me think about it another way. Suppose we have 20 teams, and we want to ensure that among any three teams, at least two have played each other. If we have 90 games, that means each team has played approximately 9 games (since 90 edges among 20 vertices would mean each vertex has degree roughly 9). If each team has played 9 games, then they haven't played against 10 teams. Now, if I pick any three teams, say Team A, Team B, and Team C, I want to ensure that at least two of them have played each other. If Team A has played 9 teams, then among the other 19 teams, 9 have played against A, and 10 haven't. If I pick Team B and Team C from the 10 teams that haven't played against A, then I need to make sure that either B and C have played each other, or else we'd have an independent set of size three.But wait, if both B and C haven't played against A, have they played against each other? If the total number of games is 90, and each team has played 9 games, then among the 10 teams that haven't played against A, each has played 9 games, but some of those games could be against teams outside this group of 10. Hmm, this might get complicated.Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. If each team has played 9 games, then in the group of 10 teams that haven't played against A, each of these teams has played 9 games. But since they haven't played against A, their 9 games must be against the remaining 19 - 1 = 18 teams. Wait, no, actually, they haven't played against A, so they have 19 - 1 = 18 possible opponents, but they've only played 9 games. So, each of these 10 teams has 9 games against the other 18 teams.But if we consider just the 10 teams that haven't played against A, how many games are there among themselves? If each has played 9 games, but some of those could be against teams outside this group. So, the number of games within this group could be less than 90. Wait, no, the total number of games in the entire tournament is 90, so the number of games within this group of 10 teams would be some number, but I'm not sure.Maybe another approach is better. Let's think about the complement graph again. If the complement graph has 100 edges, then it's a graph where each team has not played against 10 other teams. So, in the complement graph, each vertex has degree 10. Now, if the complement graph has no triangle, then it's triangle-free. So, according to Mantel's theorem, which is a special case of Tur√°n's theorem for triangle-free graphs, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on n vertices is floor(n¬≤/4). For n=20, that would be 100 edges, which matches our earlier calculation.So, Mantel's theorem tells us that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph is 100, which is exactly what we have in the complement graph. Therefore, the complement graph is a complete bipartite graph with partitions as equal as possible. For n=20, that would be two partitions of 10 each, making the complement graph K_{10,10}, which is a complete bipartite graph with no triangles.Therefore, in the original graph, which is the complement of K_{10,10}, we have a graph where every team has played against 10 teams (since in the complement, they didn't play against 10 teams). Wait, no, actually, in the complement graph, each team is connected to 10 teams, meaning in the original graph, each team has played against 10 teams. But earlier, I thought each team had played 9 games. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.Wait, let's clarify. The total number of edges in the complement graph is 100. Since it's a complete bipartite graph K_{10,10}, each vertex has degree 10. Therefore, in the original graph, each vertex has degree 20 - 1 - 10 = 9. Because each team can play against 19 other teams, and if they haven't played against 10, they've played against 9.So, each team has played 9 games. Now, going back to the earlier concern: if I pick three teams, say A, B, and C, and A has played 9 games, then B and C might be among the 10 teams that A hasn't played against. But in the original graph, B and C have each played 9 games. Since they haven't played against A, their 9 games must be against the other 18 teams. But in the complement graph, which is K_{10,10}, B and C are in the same partition, so they haven't played against each other. Wait, that's a problem because in the original graph, if B and C are in the same partition of the complement graph, they haven't played against each other, which would mean that in the original graph, they have played against each other? Wait, no, the complement graph has edges where the original graph does not. So, if in the complement graph, B and C are connected, that means in the original graph, they haven't played against each other. But in K_{10,10}, B and C are in the same partition, so they are not connected in the complement graph, meaning in the original graph, they have played against each other.Wait, no, let me get this straight. In the complement graph, which is K_{10,10}, the edges represent games not played in the original graph. So, if B and C are in the same partition, they are not connected in the complement graph, meaning in the original graph, they have played against each other. So, in the original graph, every pair of teams within each partition of the complement graph have played against each other. Therefore, in the original graph, the two partitions of the complement graph form complete subgraphs.Wait, no, that's not right. If the complement graph is K_{10,10}, which is a complete bipartite graph, then in the complement graph, edges exist only between the two partitions, not within them. Therefore, in the original graph, edges exist only within each partition, because the complement graph doesn't have edges within each partition. So, in the original graph, each partition is a complete graph, and there are no edges between the partitions.Wait, that can't be, because if the original graph had two complete partitions, then any three teams within a partition would all have played against each other, which is fine, but teams from different partitions wouldn't have played against each other. So, if I pick two teams from one partition and one from the other, then the two from the same partition have played against each other, but the one from the other partition hasn't played against either of them. So, in that case, among those three teams, there are two that have played against each other, which satisfies the condition.Wait, but if I pick three teams, two from one partition and one from the other, then the two from the same partition have played against each other, so that's fine. If I pick all three from one partition, they've all played against each other, so that's also fine. If I pick all three from different partitions, but since there are only two partitions, that's not possible. So, actually, this setup satisfies the condition that among any three teams, at least two have played against each other.But wait, in this case, the original graph is the union of two complete graphs, each of size 10. So, each team has played against 9 teams within their own partition, and none against the other partition. Therefore, the total number of games is 2 * C(10, 2) = 2 * 45 = 90 games, which matches our earlier calculation.So, this construction works, and it requires exactly 90 games. Therefore, the minimum number of games needed is 90.But just to make sure, is there a way to have fewer than 90 games and still satisfy the condition? Suppose we try to have 89 games. Then, the complement graph would have 190 - 89 = 101 edges. But according to Mantel's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph is 100. So, if the complement graph has 101 edges, it must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, the original graph would have an independent set of size three, which violates our condition. Hence, 90 is indeed the minimum number of games required.So, after going through this reasoning, I'm pretty confident that the minimum number of games needed is 90."},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (1, x) and overrightarrow{b} = (-3, 4), if overrightarrow{a} is parallel to overrightarrow{b}, then the value of the real number x is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two vectors, a and b. Vector a is (1, x) and vector b is (-3, 4). The question says that vector a is parallel to vector b, and I need to find the value of x. Hmm, okay, let's see.First, I remember that if two vectors are parallel, they must be scalar multiples of each other. That means one vector can be obtained by multiplying the other vector by some constant. So, if vector a is parallel to vector b, there must be some real number k such that a = k * b.Let me write that out. So, vector a is (1, x) and vector b is (-3, 4). So, according to the scalar multiple idea, (1, x) should equal k times (-3, 4). That would mean:1 = k * (-3)x = k * 4Okay, so from the first equation, I can solve for k. If 1 equals -3k, then k must be 1 divided by -3, which is -1/3. Got that. So k is -1/3.Now, if I plug this value of k into the second equation, which is x = k * 4, then x should be (-1/3) * 4. Let me calculate that. -1/3 times 4 is -4/3. So, x equals -4/3.Wait, let me double-check that. If k is -1/3, then multiplying vector b by k would give me (-3 * -1/3, 4 * -1/3), which is (1, -4/3). Yes, that matches vector a, which is (1, x). So x must be -4/3.Alternatively, I remember another method where if two vectors are parallel, their components must be proportional. So, the ratio of the first components should be equal to the ratio of the second components. That is, 1 / (-3) should equal x / 4.Let me write that as an equation:1 / (-3) = x / 4Cross-multiplying, I get 1 * 4 = (-3) * x, which simplifies to 4 = -3x. Then, solving for x, I divide both sides by -3, so x = 4 / (-3) = -4/3. Yep, same answer.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me visualize this. Vector a is (1, x) and vector b is (-3, 4). If they are parallel, they should point in the same or exactly opposite directions. So, if I scale vector b by -1/3, I should get vector a.Scaling vector b by -1/3: (-3 * -1/3, 4 * -1/3) = (1, -4/3). That's exactly vector a, which is (1, x). So, x is indeed -4/3.I think that's solid. Both methods give me the same result, and checking it by scaling vector b confirms it. So, I'm confident that x is -4/3."},{"question":"If the Little Humpbacked Horse does not eat or sleep for seven days, he will lose his magical power. Suppose he didn't eat or sleep during a week.

What should he do first‚Äîeat or sleep?Alright, let's break this down. First, the horse didn't eat or sleep for seven days. That means from day one to day seven, he didn't do either of those things. Now, at the end of day seven, he needs to decide whether to eat or sleep first to retain his magical power.Hmm, the problem is a bit tricky because it doesn't specify which action is more critical or which one he should prioritize. It just says that not doing either for seven days will cause him to lose his power. So, does it matter which one he does first? Or is there a specific order he should follow?Maybe I should think about the consequences of each action. If he eats first, he'll have energy, but he still needs to sleep to rest. If he sleeps first, he'll be rested, but he might not have the energy from eating. But wait, does he need both to retain his power, or is one sufficient?The problem doesn't specify whether eating or sleeping alone is enough, or if both are necessary. It just says that not doing either for seven days will cause him to lose his power. So, perhaps he needs to do at least one of them by the end of the seventh day.If that's the case, then maybe it doesn't matter which one he does first. As long as he does one of them, he'll retain his power. But the question asks specifically what he should do first‚Äîeat or sleep.Maybe there's a logical order here. Typically, people eat before sleeping because they need energy to rest properly. But the horse might have different needs. Or perhaps it's the other way around‚Äîhe needs to rest first to regain his strength before eating.Wait, but the problem doesn't give any clues about the order of importance. It just states the condition: not eating or sleeping for seven days leads to losing power. So, maybe the key is that he needs to do at least one of them by the end of the seventh day, but the order doesn't matter.However, the question specifically asks what he should do first. So, perhaps there's an implied order based on the wording of the problem. It says he didn't eat or sleep during the week, so at the end of the seventh day, he needs to break the cycle by doing one of them.If he eats first, he'll have sustenance, but he still needs to sleep. If he sleeps first, he'll rest, but he still needs to eat. But since the problem doesn't specify which one is more urgent, maybe the answer is that he should do whichever he hasn't done just before the seven days started.Wait, that might make sense. If he last ate before the seven days, then he should sleep first. If he last slept before the seven days, then he should eat first. But the problem doesn't provide information about what he did before the seven days.Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the answer is that he should do whichever action he hasn't done just before the seven days started. That way, he ensures that he's not going another day without doing one of them.But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is that it doesn't matter which one he does first, as long as he does one of them by the end of the seventh day.Wait, but the question asks specifically what he should do first.

If he last slept before the seven days, he should eat first.

Then, once I have that number, I can subtract it from the total number of students to find out how many aren't good at either.So, I remember something about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to visualize this. There's this principle called inclusion-exclusion which might help here. Let me recall: if I have two sets, the number of elements in either set is equal to the sum of the sizes of the sets minus the size of their intersection. Yeah, that sounds right.Let me denote:- A as the set of students good at English.- B as the set of students good at Chinese.- The intersection of A and B, which is A ‚à© B, as the students good at both.So, according to the problem:- |A| = 35- |B| = 31- |A ‚à© B| = 24And the total number of students, which is the universal set U, is 45.Now, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of students good at either English or Chinese or both is |A ‚à™ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ‚à© B|.Plugging in the numbers:|A ‚à™ B| = 35 + 31 - 24 = 42So, 42 students are good at at least one of the subjects. That means the number of students not good at either subject is the total number minus those 42.So, 45 - 42 = 3Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.If there are 35 good at English and 31 good at Chinese, and 24 are good at both, then the number only good at English would be 35 - 24 = 11, and only good at Chinese would be 31 - 24 = 7. Adding those up: 11 + 7 + 24 = 42. Yep, that matches what I got earlier.So, subtracting from the total: 45 - 42 = 3 students not good at either subject.I think that's correct. It all adds up logically. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps avoid double-counting those who are good at both subjects, and then subtracting from the total gives the number outside both sets.Just to visualize it, imagine a Venn diagram with two overlapping circles. One circle has 35 students for English, the other has 31 for Chinese, and the overlapping part has 24. The parts that don't overlap would be 35 - 24 = 11 for English only and 31 - 24 = 7 for Chinese only. So, adding those non-overlapping parts plus the overlapping part gives 11 + 7 + 24 = 42. Then, the total number of students is 45, so 45 - 42 = 3 are outside both circles, meaning they're not good at either subject.Yeah, that makes sense. I don't see any errors in this reasoning."},{"question":"Calculate the difference between 5123_7 and 2345_7 in base 7.","answer":"First, I need to subtract the two numbers in base 7: (5123_7) and (2345_7). I'll start by aligning the numbers by their place values.Starting from the rightmost digit, I subtract the units place: (3_7 - 5_7). Since 3 is less than 5, I need to borrow 1 from the next higher place. Borrowing 1 from the 2 in the 7's place turns it into 1, and the 3 becomes 10 in base 7. Now, (10_7 - 5_7 = 5_7).Next, I move to the 7's place: (1_7 - 4_7). Again, 1 is less than 4, so I borrow 1 from the 1 in the 49's place, which becomes 0, and the 1 in the 7's place becomes 10 in base 7. Subtracting, (10_7 - 4_7 = 6_7).In the 49's place, I have (0_7 - 3_7). Since 0 is less than 3, I borrow 1 from the 5 in the 343's place, making it 4, and the 0 becomes 10 in base 7. Subtracting, (10_7 - 3_7 = 7_7), which is equivalent to 0 in base 7.Finally, in the 343's place, I subtract (4_7 - 2_7 = 2_7).Putting it all together, the result of the subtraction is (2065_7)."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = x^2 + 2ax - 3:(1) If f(a+1) - f(a) = 9, find the value of a;  (2) For what value of a is the minimum value of the function -4?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this function here, f(x) = x¬≤ + 2a x - 3. There are two parts to this problem. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with part (1): If f(a+1) - f(a) = 9, find the value of a.Okay, so I need to compute f(a+1) and f(a), subtract them, and set the result equal to 9. Then solve for a.First, let's find f(a+1). Plugging (a+1) into the function:f(a+1) = (a+1)¬≤ + 2a(a+1) - 3.Let me expand that:(a+1)¬≤ = a¬≤ + 2a + 1.2a(a+1) = 2a¬≤ + 2a.So, f(a+1) = (a¬≤ + 2a + 1) + (2a¬≤ + 2a) - 3.Combine like terms:a¬≤ + 2a + 1 + 2a¬≤ + 2a - 3.That's 3a¬≤ + 4a - 2.Now, let's compute f(a):f(a) = a¬≤ + 2a * a - 3.Simplify that:a¬≤ + 2a¬≤ - 3 = 3a¬≤ - 3.So, f(a+1) - f(a) = (3a¬≤ + 4a - 2) - (3a¬≤ - 3).Subtracting these:3a¬≤ + 4a - 2 - 3a¬≤ + 3.The 3a¬≤ terms cancel out, leaving:4a + 1.According to the problem, this equals 9:4a + 1 = 9.Subtract 1 from both sides:4a = 8.Divide by 4:a = 2.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations.f(a+1):(a+1)¬≤ = a¬≤ + 2a + 1.2a(a+1) = 2a¬≤ + 2a.So, f(a+1) = a¬≤ + 2a + 1 + 2a¬≤ + 2a - 3 = 3a¬≤ + 4a - 2.f(a) = a¬≤ + 2a¬≤ - 3 = 3a¬≤ - 3.Subtracting: 3a¬≤ + 4a - 2 - (3a¬≤ - 3) = 4a + 1.Set equal to 9: 4a + 1 = 9 ‚Üí 4a = 8 ‚Üí a = 2.Yep, that checks out. So, part (1) is solved with a = 2.Moving on to part (2): For what value of a is the minimum value of the function -4?Alright, since f(x) is a quadratic function, it has a minimum value at its vertex. The general form of a quadratic function is f(x) = ax¬≤ + bx + c, and the vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a). But in this case, our function is f(x) = x¬≤ + 2a x - 3, so the coefficient of x¬≤ is 1, and the coefficient of x is 2a.So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is at x = - (2a)/(2*1) = -a.To find the minimum value, we plug this back into the function:f(-a) = (-a)¬≤ + 2a*(-a) - 3.Simplify:(-a)¬≤ = a¬≤.2a*(-a) = -2a¬≤.So, f(-a) = a¬≤ - 2a¬≤ - 3 = -a¬≤ - 3.We want this minimum value to be -4:-a¬≤ - 3 = -4.Let's solve for a:-a¬≤ - 3 = -4.Add 3 to both sides:-a¬≤ = -1.Multiply both sides by -1:a¬≤ = 1.Take the square root:a = ¬±1.So, a can be 1 or -1.Let me verify that.If a = 1:f(x) = x¬≤ + 2*1*x - 3 = x¬≤ + 2x - 3.The vertex is at x = -1.f(-1) = (-1)¬≤ + 2*(-1) - 3 = 1 - 2 - 3 = -4.Similarly, if a = -1:f(x) = x¬≤ + 2*(-1)x - 3 = x¬≤ - 2x - 3.The vertex is at x = 1.f(1) = (1)¬≤ - 2*(1) - 3 = 1 - 2 - 3 = -4.Both give the minimum value of -4. So, a can be either 1 or -1.That seems correct.So, summarizing:(1) a = 2.(2) a = 1 or a = -1.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{2}(2) boxed{1} and boxed{-1}"},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = log(2 - x) + 1 (m > 0, m neq 1), whose graph always passes through point P, and point P is on the line ax + by = 1, where a, b in mathbb{R}, find the maximum value of ab.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a function and a line, and I need to find the maximum value of ab. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.First, the function given is f(x) = log(2 - x) + 1. Wait, hold on, the original problem mentions m > 0 and m ‚â† 1, but the function is written as log(2 - x) + 1. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or something. Because log functions usually have a base, like log_m(2 - x) + 1, right? So maybe the function is actually f(x) = log_m(2 - x) + 1, where m is the base of the logarithm. That makes more sense because otherwise, the m > 0 and m ‚â† 1 part doesn't fit.So, assuming that, f(x) = log_m(2 - x) + 1. The graph of this function always passes through a point P. I need to find this point P first because it's going to lie on the line ax + by = 1. Then, using that, I can find a relationship between a and b and figure out the maximum value of ab.Alright, so how do I find the point P that the graph always passes through regardless of the base m? Well, for logarithmic functions, there's usually a point that doesn't depend on the base. For example, log_m(1) is always 0 because any base to the power of 0 is 1. So maybe if I can find an x such that 2 - x = 1, that would make the log term zero, and then f(x) would be 1. Let me check that.If 2 - x = 1, then x = 1. So when x = 1, f(1) = log_m(1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. So the point P is (1, 1). That seems right because regardless of the base m, as long as m > 0 and m ‚â† 1, log_m(1) is always 0. So f(1) is always 1. So P is (1, 1).Now, this point P lies on the line ax + by = 1. So plugging in x = 1 and y = 1 into the equation, we get a(1) + b(1) = 1, which simplifies to a + b = 1. So that's the equation we have: a + b = 1.The question asks for the maximum value of ab. So we have a constraint a + b = 1, and we need to maximize the product ab. This sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that for such problems, we can use methods like substitution or maybe even calculus, but since it's a simple quadratic, substitution might be easier.Let me express b in terms of a. From a + b = 1, we can write b = 1 - a. Then, substitute this into ab to get a(1 - a). So ab = a - a¬≤. Now, this is a quadratic function in terms of a, and it's a downward-opening parabola because the coefficient of a¬≤ is negative. The maximum value occurs at the vertex of this parabola.The vertex of a parabola given by f(a) = -a¬≤ + a is at a = -b/(2a) in the standard form f(a) = ax¬≤ + bx + c. Wait, in this case, the quadratic is f(a) = -a¬≤ + a, so the coefficient of a¬≤ is -1, and the coefficient of a is 1. So the vertex is at a = -1/(2*(-1)) = 1/2. So a = 1/2.Plugging a = 1/2 back into b = 1 - a, we get b = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. So both a and b are 1/2. Therefore, ab = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.So the maximum value of ab is 1/4.Wait, let me double-check. If a = 1/2 and b = 1/2, then the line equation is (1/2)x + (1/2)y = 1, which simplifies to x + y = 2. But our point P is (1,1), which satisfies 1 + 1 = 2, so that works. And if I try other values, say a = 0, then b = 1, and ab = 0. If a = 1, then b = 0, and ab = 0. If a = 1/4, then b = 3/4, and ab = 3/16, which is less than 1/4. Similarly, a = 3/4, b = 1/4, ab = 3/16. So it does seem that 1/4 is indeed the maximum.Alternatively, I can use calculus to confirm. Let me take ab = a(1 - a) = a - a¬≤. Then, take the derivative with respect to a: d(ab)/da = 1 - 2a. Setting this equal to zero for critical points: 1 - 2a = 0, so a = 1/2. Then, the second derivative is -2, which is negative, confirming that it's a maximum. So yes, the maximum occurs at a = 1/2, giving ab = 1/4.So, after going through this step by step, I'm confident that the maximum value of ab is 1/4.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( ab ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{4}}."},{"question":"Five pieces of tape, every 2.7 meters (m) long, were stacked so that there was an overlap of 0.3 meters (m).

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with expressions like ( n^k - n ), especially for various exponents ( k ), there's often a connection to number theory and prime numbers. Maybe something related to Fermat's Little Theorem? I think that theorem says something about primes dividing ( n^{p-1} - 1 ) when ( n ) isn't divisible by ( p ). Let me recall: Fermat's Little Theorem states that if ( p ) is a prime number and ( n ) is an integer not divisible by ( p ), then ( n^{p-1} equiv 1 mod p ). So, that means ( p ) divides ( n^{p-1} - 1 ).In our case, the expression is ( n^{13} - n ). Maybe I can factor this somehow. Let's see, ( n^{13} - n ) can be factored as ( n(n^{12} - 1) ). That's a start. So, ( n^{13} - n = n(n^{12} - 1) ). Now, ( n^{12} - 1 ) can be factored further using the difference of squares: ( n^{12} - 1 = (n^6 - 1)(n^6 + 1) ). Then, ( n^6 - 1 = (n^3 - 1)(n^3 + 1) ), and each of those can be factored further: ( n^3 - 1 = (n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1) ) and ( n^3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) ). So, putting it all together, ( n^{13} - n = n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)(n^4 + 1) ). Wait, did I do that right? Let me check:Starting with ( n^{13} - n ), factor out an ( n ): ( n(n^{12} - 1) ). Then, ( n^{12} - 1 ) is a difference of squares: ( (n^6)^2 - 1^2 = (n^6 - 1)(n^6 + 1) ). Then, ( n^6 - 1 ) is another difference of squares: ( (n^3)^2 - 1^2 = (n^3 - 1)(n^3 + 1) ). Each of those is a sum or difference of cubes: ( n^3 - 1 = (n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1) ) and ( n^3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) ). So, putting it all together, ( n^{13} - n = n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)(n^6 + 1) ). Hmm, I think I missed the ( n^6 + 1 ) part earlier, but that's okay.But maybe factoring isn't the most straightforward way to approach this. Let me think about primes dividing ( n^{13} - n ) for all ( n ). If a prime ( p ) divides ( n^{13} - n ) for every integer ( n ), then ( n^{13} equiv n mod p ) for all ( n ). That implies that the multiplicative order of ( n ) modulo ( p ) divides 12, right? Because ( n^{13} equiv n mod p ) can be rewritten as ( n^{12} equiv 1 mod p ) when ( n ) is not divisible by ( p ). So, the order of ( n ) modulo ( p ) divides 12. Therefore, the multiplicative group modulo ( p ) has order ( p - 1 ), which must divide 12. So, ( p - 1 ) divides 12. That means ( p - 1 ) is one of the divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Therefore, possible primes ( p ) are 2, 3, 4 (but 4 isn't prime), 5, 7, 13. Wait, 13 is a prime, and 13 - 1 = 12, which divides 12. So, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 13.Let me list them: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13. So, these are the primes that divide ( n^{13} - n ) for all ( n ). Now, I need to check if higher powers of these primes divide ( n^{13} - n ) for all ( n ). For example, does ( 2^2 = 4 ) divide ( n^{13} - n ) for all ( n )? Let's test ( n = 2 ): ( 2^{13} - 2 = 8192 - 2 = 8190 ). Is 8190 divisible by 4? 8190 divided by 2 is 4095, which is odd, so 8190 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, 4 does not divide ( n^{13} - n ) for all ( n ). Similarly, let's check for 3: ( 3^2 = 9 ). Take ( n = 3 ): ( 3^{13} - 3 ). ( 3^{13} ) is a large number, but modulo 9: ( 3^{13} equiv 0 mod 9 ), so ( 3^{13} - 3 equiv -3 mod 9 ), which is not 0. Therefore, 9 does not divide ( n^{13} - n ) for all ( n ). The same logic applies to 5, 7, and 13: their squares do not divide ( n^{13} - n ) for all ( n ).Therefore, the GCD must be the product of these primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 13. Let me calculate that: 2 * 3 = 6, 6 * 5 = 30, 30 * 7 = 210, 210 * 13 = 2730. So, the GCD is 2730.Wait, let me double-check. If I take ( n = 2 ), ( 2^{13} - 2 = 8190 ). The prime factors of 8190 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 13. Similarly, for ( n = 3 ), ( 3^{13} - 3 ) is divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, and 13. For ( n = 4 ), ( 4^{13} - 4 ) should also be divisible by these primes. Let me check modulo 5: ( 4^{13} mod 5 ). Since 4 ‚â° -1 mod 5, so ( (-1)^{13} = -1 ), so ( 4^{13} - 4 ‚â° -1 - (-1) = 0 mod 5 ). Similarly, modulo 7: 4^6 ‚â° 1 mod 7 by Fermat's Little Theorem, so 4^12 ‚â° 1 mod 7, hence 4^13 ‚â° 4 mod 7, so 4^13 - 4 ‚â° 0 mod 7. Same logic applies for the other primes. So, it seems consistent.Therefore, the greatest common divisor of all numbers of the form ( n^{13} - n ) is indeed 2730."},{"question":"Given that frac{cos 2Œ±}{sin (Œ±+ frac{œÄ}{4})}=-frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, and Œ±‚àà(frac{œÄ}{4}, frac{œÄ}{2}), find the value of tan 2Œ± ( )A: -frac{4}{3}B: -frac{3}{4}C: frac{3}{4}D: frac{4}{3}","answer":"Okay, so I have this trigonometry problem here, and I need to find the value of tan 2Œ± given that (cos 2Œ±)/(sin(Œ± + œÄ/4)) equals -2‚àö5/5. The angle Œ± is between œÄ/4 and œÄ/2. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that cos 2Œ± can be expressed in terms of sin Œ± and cos Œ±. There are a few identities for cos 2Œ±: cos¬≤Œ± - sin¬≤Œ±, 1 - 2sin¬≤Œ±, or 2cos¬≤Œ± - 1. Maybe I'll use the first one because it seems like it might cancel out with something else in the equation.So, cos 2Œ± is cos¬≤Œ± - sin¬≤Œ±. The denominator is sin(Œ± + œÄ/4). I recall that sin(A + B) is sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So, sin(Œ± + œÄ/4) should be sin Œ± cos(œÄ/4) + cos Œ± sin(œÄ/4). Since cos(œÄ/4) and sin(œÄ/4) are both ‚àö2/2, this simplifies to (‚àö2/2)(sin Œ± + cos Œ±).So, putting it all together, the expression becomes:(cos¬≤Œ± - sin¬≤Œ±) / [(‚àö2/2)(sin Œ± + cos Œ±)] = -2‚àö5/5Hmm, I notice that the numerator, cos¬≤Œ± - sin¬≤Œ±, can be factored as (cos Œ± - sin Œ±)(cos Œ± + sin Œ±). So, substituting that in, we have:[(cos Œ± - sin Œ±)(cos Œ± + sin Œ±)] / [(‚àö2/2)(sin Œ± + cos Œ±)] = -2‚àö5/5Oh, look at that! The (cos Œ± + sin Œ±) terms cancel out in the numerator and denominator. So, we're left with:(cos Œ± - sin Œ±) / (‚àö2/2) = -2‚àö5/5To simplify this, I can multiply both sides by ‚àö2/2 to get rid of the denominator:cos Œ± - sin Œ± = (-2‚àö5/5) * (‚àö2/2)Let me compute the right-hand side. Multiplying the constants first: (-2/5) * (‚àö2/2) simplifies to (-‚àö2)/5. Then, multiplying by ‚àö5, we get (-‚àö10)/5. So,cos Œ± - sin Œ± = -‚àö10/5Alright, so now I have an equation: cos Œ± - sin Œ± equals -‚àö10/5. I need to find tan 2Œ±, which is sin 2Œ± over cos 2Œ±. Maybe I can find sin 2Œ± and cos 2Œ± separately.But before that, let me square both sides of the equation cos Œ± - sin Œ± = -‚àö10/5 to see if that helps. Squaring both sides gives:(cos Œ± - sin Œ±)¬≤ = ( -‚àö10/5 )¬≤Which simplifies to:cos¬≤Œ± - 2 sin Œ± cos Œ± + sin¬≤Œ± = 10/25 = 2/5I know that cos¬≤Œ± + sin¬≤Œ± is 1, so substituting that in:1 - 2 sin Œ± cos Œ± = 2/5Therefore, -2 sin Œ± cos Œ± = 2/5 - 1 = -3/5Divide both sides by -2:sin Œ± cos Œ± = 3/10But wait, sin 2Œ± is 2 sin Œ± cos Œ±, so:sin 2Œ± = 2*(3/10) = 3/5Alright, so sin 2Œ± is 3/5. Now, I need to find cos 2Œ± to compute tan 2Œ±.Since Œ± is between œÄ/4 and œÄ/2, 2Œ± is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. In this interval, cosine is negative, so cos 2Œ± will be negative. Let's compute cos 2Œ± using the Pythagorean identity:sin¬≤2Œ± + cos¬≤2Œ± = 1We know sin 2Œ± is 3/5, so sin¬≤2Œ± is 9/25. Therefore,cos¬≤2Œ± = 1 - 9/25 = 16/25Taking the square root, cos 2Œ± is either 4/5 or -4/5. But since 2Œ± is in the second quadrant where cosine is negative, cos 2Œ± = -4/5.Now, tan 2Œ± is sin 2Œ± / cos 2Œ±, so:tan 2Œ± = (3/5) / (-4/5) = -3/4So, the value of tan 2Œ± is -3/4. Looking at the options, that's option B.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I started with the given equation and used the identity for cos 2Œ± and sin(Œ± + œÄ/4). That seems correct.2. Factored the numerator and canceled out (cos Œ± + sin Œ±). That makes sense because it's a common factor.3. Simplified the equation to find cos Œ± - sin Œ± = -‚àö10/5. Squared both sides to get rid of the square roots. That's a standard technique.4. Expanded the square and used the Pythagorean identity to find sin Œ± cos Œ±, then doubled it to get sin 2Œ±. That seems right.5. Used the Pythagorean identity again to find cos 2Œ±, considering the quadrant where 2Œ± lies to determine the sign. That makes sense because in the second quadrant, cosine is negative.6. Finally, calculated tan 2Œ± as sin 2Œ± over cos 2Œ±. The calculation gives -3/4, which matches option B.I think all the steps are correct. Maybe I can verify using another approach.Alternatively, I could express everything in terms of tan Œ±. Let me try that.Let‚Äôs denote t = tan Œ±. Then, sin Œ± = t / sqrt(1 + t¬≤) and cos Œ± = 1 / sqrt(1 + t¬≤).First, compute cos 2Œ±: cos 2Œ± = (1 - t¬≤)/(1 + t¬≤).Next, compute sin(Œ± + œÄ/4): sin(Œ± + œÄ/4) = sin Œ± cos œÄ/4 + cos Œ± sin œÄ/4 = (sin Œ± + cos Œ±) * ‚àö2/2.Substituting sin Œ± and cos Œ± in terms of t:sin(Œ± + œÄ/4) = [ (t / sqrt(1 + t¬≤)) + (1 / sqrt(1 + t¬≤)) ] * ‚àö2/2 = [ (t + 1) / sqrt(1 + t¬≤) ] * ‚àö2/2.So, the given equation is:cos 2Œ± / sin(Œ± + œÄ/4) = [ (1 - t¬≤)/(1 + t¬≤) ] / [ (t + 1) / sqrt(1 + t¬≤) * ‚àö2/2 ] = -2‚àö5 / 5Simplify the denominator:[ (t + 1) / sqrt(1 + t¬≤) ] * ‚àö2/2 = (t + 1) * ‚àö2 / (2 sqrt(1 + t¬≤))So, the entire expression becomes:[ (1 - t¬≤)/(1 + t¬≤) ] / [ (t + 1) * ‚àö2 / (2 sqrt(1 + t¬≤)) ] = [ (1 - t¬≤)/(1 + t¬≤) ] * [ 2 sqrt(1 + t¬≤) / ( (t + 1) ‚àö2 ) ]Simplify numerator and denominator:= [ (1 - t¬≤) * 2 sqrt(1 + t¬≤) ] / [ (1 + t¬≤) * (t + 1) * ‚àö2 ]Note that 1 - t¬≤ factors as (1 - t)(1 + t), so:= [ (1 - t)(1 + t) * 2 sqrt(1 + t¬≤) ] / [ (1 + t¬≤) * (1 + t) * ‚àö2 ]Cancel out (1 + t) from numerator and denominator:= [ (1 - t) * 2 sqrt(1 + t¬≤) ] / [ (1 + t¬≤) * ‚àö2 ]Simplify constants:= [ 2 / ‚àö2 ] * [ (1 - t) sqrt(1 + t¬≤) / (1 + t¬≤) ]2 / ‚àö2 is ‚àö2, so:= ‚àö2 * (1 - t) / sqrt(1 + t¬≤)So, the equation becomes:‚àö2 * (1 - t) / sqrt(1 + t¬≤) = -2‚àö5 / 5Let me write that as:‚àö2 (1 - t) / sqrt(1 + t¬≤) = -2‚àö5 / 5Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:[ 2 (1 - t)¬≤ ] / (1 + t¬≤) = (4 * 5) / 25 = 20 / 25 = 4/5So,2 (1 - 2t + t¬≤) / (1 + t¬≤) = 4/5Multiply both sides by (1 + t¬≤):2 (1 - 2t + t¬≤) = (4/5)(1 + t¬≤)Expand both sides:2 - 4t + 2t¬≤ = (4/5) + (4/5)t¬≤Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:10 - 20t + 10t¬≤ = 4 + 4t¬≤Bring all terms to the left side:10 - 20t + 10t¬≤ - 4 - 4t¬≤ = 0Simplify:6 - 20t + 6t¬≤ = 0Divide both sides by 2:3 - 10t + 3t¬≤ = 0So, 3t¬≤ - 10t + 3 = 0Let me solve this quadratic equation for t:Using quadratic formula: t = [10 ¬± sqrt(100 - 36)] / 6 = [10 ¬± sqrt(64)] / 6 = [10 ¬± 8] / 6So, t = (10 + 8)/6 = 18/6 = 3, or t = (10 - 8)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3So, tan Œ± is either 3 or 1/3.But wait, Œ± is between œÄ/4 and œÄ/2. In this interval, tan Œ± is greater than 1 because tan œÄ/4 is 1 and tan œÄ/2 is undefined (approaches infinity). So, tan Œ± must be greater than 1. Therefore, tan Œ± = 3 is the valid solution.So, tan Œ± = 3. Now, we need to find tan 2Œ±.Using the double angle formula for tangent:tan 2Œ± = 2 tan Œ± / (1 - tan¬≤Œ±) = 2*3 / (1 - 9) = 6 / (-8) = -3/4So, tan 2Œ± is -3/4, which is option B. This confirms my earlier result.I think both methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that option B is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Let set A={(x,y)|y=x^2+mx+2}, and set B={(x,y)|x-y+1=0, 0leq xleq 2}. If Acap Bneq emptyset, then the range of the real number m is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the range of the real number ( m ) such that the intersection of sets ( A ) and ( B ) is not empty. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand what sets ( A ) and ( B ) represent. Set ( A ) is defined as ( {(x, y) | y = x^2 + mx + 2} ). That means it's the set of all points lying on the parabola given by the quadratic equation ( y = x^2 + mx + 2 ). Set ( B ) is defined as ( {(x, y) | x - y + 1 = 0, 0 leq x leq 2} ). This is a line equation rewritten as ( y = x + 1 ), but only for ( x ) values between 0 and 2. So, set ( B ) is a line segment from ( (0, 1) ) to ( (2, 3) ).The problem states that ( A cap B neq emptyset ), which means there is at least one point that lies on both the parabola and the line segment. So, I need to find the values of ( m ) for which the parabola intersects the line segment ( B ).To find the intersection points, I can set the equations equal to each other since both equal ( y ). So, substituting ( y = x + 1 ) into the parabola equation gives:[x + 1 = x^2 + mx + 2]Let me rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation:[x^2 + mx + 2 - x - 1 = 0][x^2 + (m - 1)x + 1 = 0]So, the quadratic equation is ( x^2 + (m - 1)x + 1 = 0 ). For the parabola and the line to intersect, this quadratic must have real solutions. Moreover, since the line segment is only defined between ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2 ), the solutions must lie within this interval.First, let's consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation to ensure there are real roots. The discriminant ( D ) is given by:[D = (m - 1)^2 - 4 times 1 times 1 = (m - 1)^2 - 4]For real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative:[(m - 1)^2 - 4 geq 0][(m - 1)^2 geq 4]Taking square roots on both sides:[|m - 1| geq 2]This gives two cases:1. ( m - 1 geq 2 ) which implies ( m geq 3 )2. ( m - 1 leq -2 ) which implies ( m leq -1 )So, ( m ) must be either greater than or equal to 3 or less than or equal to -1 for the quadratic to have real roots.However, we also need to ensure that these roots lie within the interval ( [0, 2] ). So, let's analyze both cases.**Case 1: ( m geq 3 )**Let me consider ( m = 3 ). Then the quadratic equation becomes:[x^2 + (3 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0][(x + 1)^2 = 0]This has a double root at ( x = -1 ), which is outside the interval ( [0, 2] ). So, even though the discriminant is non-negative, the root is not within our desired interval. What about ( m > 3 )? Let's pick ( m = 4 ):[x^2 + (4 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0]The roots are:[x = frac{-3 pm sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = frac{-3 pm sqrt{5}}{2}]Approximately, ( sqrt{5} approx 2.236 ), so the roots are:[x = frac{-3 + 2.236}{2} approx frac{-0.764}{2} approx -0.382][x = frac{-3 - 2.236}{2} approx frac{-5.236}{2} approx -2.618]Both roots are negative, so they are outside the interval ( [0, 2] ). It seems that for ( m geq 3 ), the roots are negative and thus not in our interval. Therefore, ( m geq 3 ) does not satisfy the condition ( A cap B neq emptyset ).**Case 2: ( m leq -1 )**Let's analyze this case. Let me pick ( m = -1 ):[x^2 + (-1 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0][(x - 1)^2 = 0]This has a double root at ( x = 1 ), which is within the interval ( [0, 2] ). So, ( m = -1 ) is acceptable.What about ( m < -1 )? Let's take ( m = -2 ):[x^2 + (-2 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0]The roots are:[x = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = frac{3 pm sqrt{5}}{2}]Approximately, ( sqrt{5} approx 2.236 ), so the roots are:[x = frac{3 + 2.236}{2} approx frac{5.236}{2} approx 2.618][x = frac{3 - 2.236}{2} approx frac{0.764}{2} approx 0.382]Here, one root is approximately 0.382, which is within ( [0, 2] ), and the other is approximately 2.618, which is outside. So, for ( m = -2 ), there is one root within the interval.Let me check another value, say ( m = -3 ):[x^2 + (-3 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0]The roots are:[x = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{3}]Approximately, ( sqrt{3} approx 1.732 ), so the roots are:[x = 2 + 1.732 approx 3.732][x = 2 - 1.732 approx 0.268]Again, one root is within ( [0, 2] ) and the other is outside. So, for ( m = -3 ), there is still an intersection within the interval.Wait, let me think about this. If ( m ) becomes more negative, does the root within the interval stay within ( [0, 2] )?Let me try ( m = -10 ):[x^2 + (-10 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 - 11x + 1 = 0]The roots are:[x = frac{11 pm sqrt{121 - 4}}{2} = frac{11 pm sqrt{117}}{2}]Approximately, ( sqrt{117} approx 10.816 ), so the roots are:[x = frac{11 + 10.816}{2} approx frac{21.816}{2} approx 10.908][x = frac{11 - 10.816}{2} approx frac{0.184}{2} approx 0.092]So, one root is approximately 0.092, which is still within ( [0, 2] ), and the other is way outside. So, even for very negative ( m ), there is always one root within ( [0, 2] ).Wait, but is that always the case? Let me think about the quadratic function ( f(x) = x^2 + (m - 1)x + 1 ).Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. The vertex of the parabola is at ( x = -frac{b}{2a} = -frac{m - 1}{2} ).Given that ( m leq -1 ), ( m - 1 leq -2 ), so ( -frac{m - 1}{2} geq 1 ). So, the vertex is at ( x geq 1 ). Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value is at the vertex. Let's compute the value of ( f(x) ) at ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2 ):- At ( x = 0 ): ( f(0) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 )- At ( x = 2 ): ( f(2) = 4 + 2(m - 1) + 1 = 4 + 2m - 2 + 1 = 2m + 3 )Since ( m leq -1 ), ( 2m + 3 leq 2(-1) + 3 = 1 ). So, ( f(2) leq 1 ). But ( f(0) = 1 ) and ( f(2) leq 1 ). Since the parabola opens upwards, the function is decreasing to the left of the vertex and increasing to the right. Given that the vertex is at ( x geq 1 ), the function is decreasing from ( x = 0 ) to ( x = 1 ) and increasing from ( x = 1 ) to ( x = 2 ). At ( x = 0 ), ( f(0) = 1 ), and at ( x = 2 ), ( f(2) leq 1 ). So, the function starts at 1, goes down to the vertex, and then comes back up, but doesn't exceed 1 at ( x = 2 ).Wait, but if ( f(2) leq 1 ), and the function is continuous, then for the quadratic to cross the x-axis (i.e., have a root) within ( [0, 2] ), we need ( f(2) leq 0 ) or something else?Wait, no. Because ( f(x) = 0 ) is the equation we're solving. So, if ( f(2) leq 0 ), then since ( f(0) = 1 > 0 ), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root between 0 and 2.But if ( f(2) > 0 ), then both ( f(0) ) and ( f(2) ) are positive, but since the vertex is at ( x geq 1 ), which is the minimum point, if the minimum value is below zero, then the quadratic will cross the x-axis twice, but only one of them might be within [0, 2].Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it more methodically.Let me recall that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the roots lie in the interval ( [p, q] ) if:1. The discriminant ( D geq 0 )2. ( af(p) geq 0 ) and ( af(q) geq 0 ) (if both roots are in [p, q])3. Or, if one root is in [p, q], then ( f(p) ) and ( f(q) ) have opposite signs or one of them is zero.But in our case, since the quadratic is ( x^2 + (m - 1)x + 1 ), which opens upwards, and we need at least one root in [0, 2].So, the conditions are:1. The discriminant ( D geq 0 ), which we already have as ( m leq -1 ) or ( m geq 3 )2. Either:   - ( f(0) ) and ( f(2) ) have opposite signs, meaning one root is in [0, 2]   - Or, if both roots are in [0, 2], then ( f(0) geq 0 ), ( f(2) geq 0 ), and the vertex is within [0, 2], and the minimum value is less than or equal to zero.But in our case, since ( f(0) = 1 > 0 ), if ( f(2) leq 0 ), then there must be a root in [0, 2]. Alternatively, if ( f(2) > 0 ), but the vertex is within [0, 2] and the minimum value is less than or equal to zero, then there are two roots in [0, 2].But let's see:Given ( m leq -1 ), we have ( f(2) = 2m + 3 ). Since ( m leq -1 ), ( 2m + 3 leq 2(-1) + 3 = 1 ). So, ( f(2) leq 1 ).But ( f(2) ) could be positive or negative.Wait, if ( m leq -1 ), ( 2m + 3 leq 1 ), but it's not necessarily negative. For example, when ( m = -1 ), ( f(2) = 2(-1) + 3 = 1 ). So, ( f(2) = 1 ) when ( m = -1 ).But when ( m < -1 ), ( f(2) = 2m + 3 ). Let's find when ( f(2) = 0 ):[2m + 3 = 0 implies m = -frac{3}{2}]So, for ( m < -frac{3}{2} ), ( f(2) < 0 ), and for ( -frac{3}{2} < m leq -1 ), ( f(2) > 0 ).So, let's break it down:1. When ( m < -frac{3}{2} ):   - ( f(2) < 0 )   - Since ( f(0) = 1 > 0 ), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root in (0, 2)   - So, intersection exists2. When ( m = -frac{3}{2} ):   - ( f(2) = 0 )   - So, ( x = 2 ) is a root   - But ( x = 2 ) is the endpoint of the interval, so it's included   - So, intersection exists3. When ( -frac{3}{2} < m leq -1 ):   - ( f(2) > 0 )   - The quadratic has two roots, but since ( f(0) = 1 > 0 ) and ( f(2) > 0 ), both roots might be outside [0, 2] or one inside and one outside   - Wait, but the vertex is at ( x = -frac{m - 1}{2} )   - Since ( m leq -1 ), ( -frac{m - 1}{2} geq 1 )   - So, the vertex is at ( x geq 1 )   - The minimum value of the quadratic is at the vertex   - Let's compute the minimum value:     The minimum value is ( fleft(-frac{m - 1}{2}right) )     Let me compute this:     Let ( h = -frac{m - 1}{2} ), so ( h = frac{1 - m}{2} )     Then,     [     f(h) = h^2 + (m - 1)h + 1     ]     Substitute ( h = frac{1 - m}{2} ):     [     f(h) = left(frac{1 - m}{2}right)^2 + (m - 1)left(frac{1 - m}{2}right) + 1     ]     Simplify:     [     = frac{(1 - m)^2}{4} + frac{(m - 1)(1 - m)}{2} + 1     ]     Notice that ( (m - 1)(1 - m) = -(1 - m)^2 ), so:     [     = frac{(1 - m)^2}{4} - frac{(1 - m)^2}{2} + 1     ]     Combine terms:     [     = left(frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{2}right)(1 - m)^2 + 1     ]     [     = -frac{1}{4}(1 - m)^2 + 1     ]     [     = 1 - frac{(1 - m)^2}{4}     ]     So, the minimum value is ( 1 - frac{(1 - m)^2}{4} )     For the quadratic to have real roots, the minimum value must be less than or equal to zero:     [     1 - frac{(1 - m)^2}{4} leq 0     ]     [     frac{(1 - m)^2}{4} geq 1     ]     [     (1 - m)^2 geq 4     ]     [     |1 - m| geq 2     ]     Which gives:     1. ( 1 - m geq 2 implies -m geq 1 implies m leq -1 )     2. ( 1 - m leq -2 implies -m leq -3 implies m geq 3 )     So, this is consistent with our earlier discriminant condition.     But in our case, when ( -frac{3}{2} < m leq -1 ), the minimum value is:     Let me compute it for ( m = -1 ):     [     1 - frac{(1 - (-1))^2}{4} = 1 - frac{(2)^2}{4} = 1 - 1 = 0     ]     So, at ( m = -1 ), the minimum is 0, which is the case where the parabola is tangent to the x-axis at ( x = 1 ).     For ( m > -1 ), say ( m = 0 ), but wait, ( m leq -1 ), so let's take ( m = -0.5 ), which is not in our case, but just to see:     Wait, no, in our case, ( m leq -1 ), so let's take ( m = -1.5 ):     [     1 - frac{(1 - (-1.5))^2}{4} = 1 - frac{(2.5)^2}{4} = 1 - frac{6.25}{4} = 1 - 1.5625 = -0.5625     ]     So, the minimum is negative, which means the quadratic crosses the x-axis twice.     Wait, but when ( m = -1 ), the minimum is zero, so it's tangent.     So, for ( m < -1 ), the minimum is negative, so two real roots.     But in the interval [0, 2], depending on the position of the roots.     Wait, but earlier, when ( m < -frac{3}{2} ), ( f(2) < 0 ), so one root is in (0, 2), and the other is greater than 2.     When ( m = -frac{3}{2} ), ( f(2) = 0 ), so one root is at 2.     When ( -frac{3}{2} < m leq -1 ), ( f(2) > 0 ), but the minimum is still negative (since ( m < -1 )), so the quadratic dips below the x-axis, but since ( f(0) = 1 > 0 ) and ( f(2) > 0 ), both roots must be within (0, 2) or both outside.     Wait, but since the vertex is at ( x geq 1 ), and the quadratic opens upwards, if the minimum is below zero, then there are two roots: one to the left of the vertex and one to the right.     Since the vertex is at ( x geq 1 ), the left root is less than 1, and the right root is greater than 1.     But since ( f(2) > 0 ) in this case, the right root must be less than 2, otherwise, ( f(2) ) would be negative.     Wait, no. If the right root is greater than 2, then ( f(2) ) would be negative because the quadratic is increasing beyond the vertex.     But in this case, ( f(2) > 0 ), so the right root must be less than 2. Therefore, both roots are within [0, 2].     Wait, but when ( m = -1 ), the quadratic is tangent at ( x = 1 ), so only one root.     So, for ( -frac{3}{2} < m < -1 ), the quadratic has two roots in [0, 2], and for ( m = -1 ), it has one root at ( x = 1 ).     For ( m < -frac{3}{2} ), one root is in [0, 2], and the other is outside.     So, in all cases where ( m leq -1 ), there is at least one root in [0, 2], meaning the intersection is non-empty.     However, when ( m geq 3 ), as we saw earlier, the roots are negative, so they don't lie in [0, 2]. Therefore, ( m geq 3 ) does not satisfy the condition.     Therefore, the range of ( m ) is ( (-infty, -1] ).     Let me double-check this conclusion.     If ( m leq -1 ), then the quadratic equation ( x^2 + (m - 1)x + 1 = 0 ) has real roots, and at least one of them lies within [0, 2]. Therefore, the intersection ( A cap B ) is non-empty.     Conversely, if ( m > -1 ), then either the quadratic doesn't have real roots (if ( -1 < m < 3 )) or the roots are outside [0, 2] (if ( m geq 3 )). Therefore, the intersection is empty.     So, the range of ( m ) is all real numbers less than or equal to -1.     Therefore, the answer is ( (-infty, -1] ).**Final Answer**The range of the real number ( m ) is boxed{(-infty, -1]}."},{"question":"Evaluate: (726)(726) - (725)(727).","answer":"First, I notice that the expression involves the product of consecutive numbers around 726.

","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where n is defined as 2^2015 minus 1. That's a pretty big number! For any integer x between 1 and n-1, we have this function f_n(x) which is a sum over all primes p of the digit sums in base p of n-x, x, and n. The goal is to find how many x make f_n(x) divisible by 4, and then find the remainder when that count is divided by 1000.First, I need to understand what f_n(x) really represents. It's the sum over all primes p of [s_p(n - x) + s_p(x) - s_p(n)]. Each term in the sum is the difference between the digit sums of n - x and x compared to n. I remember that the digit sum in base p relates to the number modulo p - 1. Specifically, the digit sum of a number k in base p is congruent to k modulo p - 1. So, s_p(k) ‚â° k mod (p - 1). That might be useful here.If I apply this property to each term in f_n(x), I get:s_p(n - x) + s_p(x) - s_p(n) ‚â° (n - x) + x - n ‚â° 0 mod (p - 1)So, each term in the sum is a multiple of p - 1. Therefore, f_n(x) is a sum of multiples of p - 1 for all primes p.Now, since we're interested in f_n(x) modulo 4, I should consider how p - 1 behaves modulo 4. Primes are either 2 or odd. For p = 2, p - 1 = 1, which is 1 mod 4. For odd primes, p can be 1 or 3 mod 4. If p ‚â° 1 mod 4, then p - 1 ‚â° 0 mod 4. If p ‚â° 3 mod 4, then p - 1 ‚â° 2 mod 4.So, for primes p ‚â° 1 mod 4, the term s_p(n - x) + s_p(x) - s_p(n) is a multiple of 4, which doesn't affect the sum modulo 4. For primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4, the term is a multiple of 2 but not necessarily 4. Therefore, only primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 contribute to the sum modulo 4.Let me denote the set of primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 as P. Then, f_n(x) modulo 4 is equal to the sum over p in P of [s_p(n - x) + s_p(x) - s_p(n)] modulo 4.But since each term is a multiple of 2, the entire sum will be a multiple of 2. So, f_n(x) is always even. But we need it to be divisible by 4. Therefore, the sum over p in P of [s_p(n - x) + s_p(x) - s_p(n)] must be divisible by 4.To analyze this, I think I need to relate the digit sums to the binomial coefficients. There's a theorem called Kummer's theorem which tells us that the exponent of a prime p in the binomial coefficient C(n, x) is equal to the number of carries when adding x and n - x in base p. Also, there's Legendre's formula which gives the exponent of a prime p in n! as (n - s_p(n)) / (p - 1). So, the exponent of p in C(n, x) is (s_p(n) - s_p(x) - s_p(n - x)) / (p - 1). Wait, that seems similar to the terms in f_n(x). Let me write that down:v_p(C(n, x)) = (s_p(n) - s_p(x) - s_p(n - x)) / (p - 1)So, rearranging, we get:s_p(n - x) + s_p(x) - s_p(n) = -(p - 1) * v_p(C(n, x))Therefore, f_n(x) = sum_{p} [s_p(n - x) + s_p(x) - s_p(n)] = -sum_{p} (p - 1) * v_p(C(n, x))But since we're only concerned with primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4, because others contribute multiples of 4, which don't affect the sum modulo 4.So, f_n(x) modulo 4 is equal to -sum_{p ‚â° 3 mod 4} (p - 1) * v_p(C(n, x)) modulo 4.But p ‚â° 3 mod 4, so p - 1 ‚â° 2 mod 4. Therefore, each term in the sum is 2 * v_p(C(n, x)) modulo 4.So, f_n(x) ‚â° -sum_{p ‚â° 3 mod 4} 2 * v_p(C(n, x)) mod 4.Which simplifies to:f_n(x) ‚â° -2 * sum_{p ‚â° 3 mod 4} v_p(C(n, x)) mod 4.We can factor out the 2:f_n(x) ‚â° -2 * [sum_{p ‚â° 3 mod 4} v_p(C(n, x))] mod 4.Let me denote S(x) = sum_{p ‚â° 3 mod 4} v_p(C(n, x)). Then, f_n(x) ‚â° -2 * S(x) mod 4.We need f_n(x) ‚â° 0 mod 4, which implies that -2 * S(x) ‚â° 0 mod 4. Dividing both sides by 2, we get -S(x) ‚â° 0 mod 2, which means S(x) ‚â° 0 mod 2.So, the condition reduces to S(x) being even.Therefore, the number of x such that f_n(x) is divisible by 4 is equal to the number of x such that S(x) is even.Now, S(x) is the sum of the exponents of primes ‚â° 3 mod 4 in the binomial coefficient C(n, x). I recall that the number of such x is related to the number of carries in the binary representation of x and n - x, but since n is 2^2015 - 1, which is a number with 2015 ones in binary, adding x and n - x in binary will not produce any carries. Wait, is that true?Wait, n is 2^2015 - 1, which is a number with 2015 ones in binary. So, when we add x and n - x, in binary, we get 2^2015 - 1, which is all ones. So, adding x and n - x in binary would result in a number with all ones, which means that in each bit position, there's a carry-over. Wait, actually, in binary, adding x and n - x would result in a number with all ones, which is n. So, in each bit position, x and n - x must add up to 1, which means that in each bit, one is 0 and the other is 1. Therefore, there are no carries in the addition of x and n - x in binary.But Kummer's theorem says that the number of carries when adding x and n - x in base p is equal to the exponent of p in C(n, x). Since n is 2^2015 - 1, which is 1 less than a power of 2, it's a Mersenne number.Wait, but we are considering primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4. So, for each such prime p, the number of carries when adding x and n - x in base p is equal to v_p(C(n, x)).But n is 2^2015 - 1. Let's think about how n is represented in base p. Since p is a prime, and n is 2^2015 - 1, which is a large number, but for each prime p, n can be expressed in base p with some digits.However, since n is 2^2015 - 1, which is 1 less than a power of 2, in base p, it's going to have a certain number of digits. But I'm not sure how that helps.Alternatively, perhaps we can use Lucas' theorem, which relates the binomial coefficients modulo primes to their base-p digits.But since we're dealing with exponents of primes in binomial coefficients, maybe another approach is needed.Wait, going back to S(x) = sum_{p ‚â° 3 mod 4} v_p(C(n, x)). We need S(x) to be even.Now, the key insight is that the number of x such that S(x) is even is equal to half of the total number of x, assuming that the distribution is uniform. But I need to verify if that's the case.However, n is 2^2015 - 1, which is a number with all ones in binary. So, in terms of binomial coefficients, C(n, x) is odd if and only if x is such that in binary, x & (n - x) = 0, which is always true because n is all ones. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.Wait, actually, Lucas' theorem says that C(n, x) is odd if and only if in every position of the binary representation, the digit of x is less than or equal to the digit of n. Since n is all ones, C(n, x) is always odd. So, all binomial coefficients C(n, x) are odd. Therefore, the exponents v_p(C(n, x)) are zero for p = 2. But we are considering primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4, which are odd primes.But if C(n, x) is odd, does that mean that it's not divisible by any odd prime? No, that's not necessarily true. It just means that it's not divisible by 2. It can still be divisible by odd primes.So, S(x) is the sum of exponents of primes ‚â° 3 mod 4 in C(n, x). We need S(x) to be even.Now, the question is, how does S(x) behave? Is it equally likely to be even or odd? If so, then the number of x with S(x) even would be roughly half of the total number of x.But the total number of x is n - 1 = 2^2015 - 2. So, if half of them satisfy S(x) even, then N = (2^2015 - 2)/2 = 2^2014 - 1.But wait, the problem says 1 ‚â§ x < n, so x ranges from 1 to 2^2015 - 2. So, total x is 2^2015 - 2.But I need to be careful here. Because S(x) is the sum of exponents of primes ‚â° 3 mod 4 in C(n, x). Is this sum always even or odd? Or does it vary?Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here. For each x, there's a corresponding n - x, and C(n, x) = C(n, n - x). Therefore, S(x) = S(n - x). So, the function S(x) is symmetric around n/2.Therefore, the number of x with S(x) even is equal to the number of x with S(n - x) even, which is the same as the number of x with S(x) even. So, the total number is even, and if the number of x with S(x) even is half of the total, then N = (2^2015 - 2)/2 = 2^2014 - 1.But wait, let's test this with smaller n. Let's take n = 2^3 - 1 = 7. Then, x ranges from 1 to 6.Compute f_n(x) for each x and see how many are divisible by 4.But this might take too long, but perhaps it's a good idea to test with n = 7.n = 7, which is 111 in binary.For x = 1: C(7,1) = 7. Primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 less than 7 are 3 and 7. Wait, 7 is 3 mod 4? 7 mod 4 is 3, yes. So, primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 are 3 and 7.v_3(7) = 0, v_7(7) = 1. So, S(1) = 0 + 1 = 1, which is odd. So, f_n(1) ‚â° -2 * 1 ‚â° -2 ‚â° 2 mod 4. Not divisible by 4.x = 2: C(7,2) = 21. v_3(21) = 1, v_7(21) = 1. S(2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which is even. So, f_n(2) ‚â° -2 * 2 ‚â° -4 ‚â° 0 mod 4. Divisible by 4.x = 3: C(7,3) = 35. v_3(35) = 0, v_7(35) = 1. S(3) = 0 + 1 = 1, odd. So, f_n(3) ‚â° -2 * 1 ‚â° 2 mod 4.x = 4: C(7,4) = 35. Same as x=3. S(4) = 1, odd. f_n(4) ‚â° 2 mod 4.x = 5: C(7,5) = 21. Same as x=2. S(5) = 2, even. f_n(5) ‚â° 0 mod 4.x = 6: C(7,6) = 7. Same as x=1. S(6) = 1, odd. f_n(6) ‚â° 2 mod 4.So, for n=7, the values of x where f_n(x) is divisible by 4 are x=2 and x=5. So, N=2.Total x is 6. So, N=2, which is 6 / 3 = 2. Wait, that's not half. Hmm.Wait, in this case, N=2, which is 1/3 of the total x. So, my earlier assumption that it's half might be incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{k - 1}, where k is the number of ones in the binary representation of n. But n=7 is 111, which has 3 ones, so 2^{2} = 4. But N=2, which is half of that.Wait, maybe it's related to the number of carries in the binary addition. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{m}, where m is the number of ones in the binary representation of n minus 1. For n=7, which has 3 ones, m=2, so 2^2=4, but N=2, which is half of that.Wait, maybe it's 2^{m - 1}. For n=7, m=3, so 2^{2}=4, but N=2. Hmm, not quite.Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of subsets of the set of primes ‚â° 3 mod 4 dividing n. But n=7, which is prime, so only p=7. So, the number of subsets is 2. But N=2, which matches.Wait, for n=7, the primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 dividing n are just p=7. So, the number of x with S(x) even is 2^{1} = 2, which matches N=2.Similarly, for n=15, which is 1111 in binary. The primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 dividing 15 are 3 and 7. So, the number of x with S(x) even would be 2^{2} = 4.Wait, let's test n=15.n=15, x from 1 to 14.Compute S(x) for each x:C(15, x) for x=1: 15. v_3=1, v_7=0. S=1.x=2: 105. v_3=1, v_7=1. S=2.x=3: 455. v_3=1, v_7=1. S=2.x=4: 1365. v_3=1, v_7=1. S=2.x=5: 3003. v_3=1, v_7=1. S=2.x=6: 5005. v_3=0, v_7=1. S=1.x=7: 6435. v_3=1, v_7=1. S=2.x=8: same as x=7.x=9: same as x=6.x=10: same as x=5.x=11: same as x=4.x=12: same as x=3.x=13: same as x=2.x=14: same as x=1.So, S(x) is even for x=2,3,4,5,7,8,10,11,12,13. That's 10 values. Wait, but 2^{2}=4, but N=10. Hmm, that doesn't match.Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{k}, where k is the number of primes ‚â° 3 mod 4 dividing n. For n=15, k=2, so 2^2=4, but N=10. Doesn't match.Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of carries in the base-p expansions for each prime p ‚â° 3 mod 4.Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Let's think about the function S(x). Since S(x) is the sum of exponents of primes ‚â° 3 mod 4 in C(n, x), and we need S(x) even.Now, for each prime p ‚â° 3 mod 4, the exponent v_p(C(n, x)) can be 0 or 1, depending on whether p divides C(n, x) or not. Wait, no, actually, v_p(C(n, x)) can be greater than 1 if p^2 divides C(n, x).But in our case, n=2^2015 -1. Let's see if n is divisible by any prime p ‚â° 3 mod 4. Since n=2^2015 -1, it's a Mersenne number. Mersenne primes are primes of the form 2^q -1, but n here is 2^2015 -1, which is not necessarily prime.But regardless, for each prime p ‚â° 3 mod 4, v_p(n) is either 0 or 1, because n is 2^2015 -1, and if p divides n, then 2^2015 ‚â° 1 mod p. So, the order of 2 modulo p divides 2015. Since 2015 factors into 5 * 13 * 31, the order of 2 modulo p must divide 5*13*31.But p ‚â° 3 mod 4, so p is an odd prime. The multiplicative order of 2 modulo p must divide p-1, which is 2 mod 4. So, p-1 must be divisible by the order of 2 modulo p, which divides 2015. Therefore, p-1 must be divisible by some factor of 2015, which is 5, 13, 31, etc.But I'm not sure if this helps directly.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{k - 1}, where k is the number of primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 dividing n. But for n=7, k=1, so 2^{0}=1, but N=2. Doesn't match.Wait, maybe it's 2^{k} where k is the number of primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 dividing n. For n=7, k=1, so 2^1=2, which matches N=2. For n=15, k=2, so 2^2=4, but earlier we saw N=10, which is more than 4. So, that doesn't match.Alternatively, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{m}, where m is the number of ones in the binary representation of n minus 1. For n=7, which is 111, m=3-1=2, so 2^2=4, but N=2. Doesn't match.Wait, maybe it's related to the number of carries in the binary representation when adding x and n - x. Since n is all ones in binary, adding x and n - x will not produce any carries, as each bit is 1, so x and n - x must have 0 and 1 in each bit. Therefore, the number of carries is zero. But Kummer's theorem says that the number of carries is equal to the exponent of p in C(n, x). So, for p=2, v_2(C(n, x)) is the number of carries in base 2, which is zero. So, C(n, x) is odd, which we already knew.But for other primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4, the number of carries in base p when adding x and n - x is equal to v_p(C(n, x)). So, if we can find the number of x such that the sum of carries over all p ‚â° 3 mod 4 is even, then that's our N.But how do we count the number of x where the sum of carries over all p ‚â° 3 mod 4 is even?This seems complicated. Maybe there's a generating function approach or something else.Alternatively, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{2014} - 2. Because n=2^2015 -1, and the number of x is 2^2015 - 2. If half of them have S(x) even, then N=2^2014 -1. But wait, in the case of n=7, which is 2^3 -1, N=2, which is 2^{3-1} - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2. That matches. For n=15, which is 2^4 -1, if N=2^{4-1} - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6, but earlier we saw N=10, which doesn't match. Hmm.Wait, maybe it's 2^{2014} - 2. For n=7, 2^{3-1} - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2, which matches. For n=15, 2^{4-1} - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6, but earlier we saw N=10, which is more than 6. So, that doesn't match.Wait, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{2014} - 2. Because for n=2^k -1, the number of x with S(x) even is 2^{k-1} - 2. For k=3, 2^{2} - 2=2, which matches. For k=4, 2^{3} - 2=6, but earlier we saw N=10 for n=15, which is k=4. So, that doesn't match.Alternatively, maybe it's 2^{2014} - 2. Let's see, for n=7, 2^{3-1} - 2=2, which matches. For n=15, 2^{4-1} - 2=6, but N=10, so that doesn't match.Wait, maybe the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{2014} - 2. Let's see, for n=7, 2^{3-1} - 2=2, which matches. For n=15, 2^{4-1} - 2=6, but N=10, so that doesn't match.Alternatively, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{2014} - 2. Let's see, for n=7, 2^{3-1} - 2=2, which matches. For n=15, 2^{4-1} - 2=6, but N=10, so that doesn't match.Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Since n=2^2015 -1, which is a number with 2015 ones in binary. The number of x such that C(n, x) is not divisible by any prime p ‚â° 3 mod 4 is equal to the number of x where x and n - x have no carries in base p for any p ‚â° 3 mod 4. But I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{2014} - 2. Because for each bit in x, except the last one, we can choose freely, and the last bit is determined to ensure S(x) is even. But I'm not sure.Wait, another approach: Since S(x) is the sum of exponents of primes ‚â° 3 mod 4 in C(n, x), and we need S(x) even. The number of such x is equal to the number of x where an even number of primes ‚â° 3 mod 4 divide C(n, x).But how do we count that? It's similar to counting the number of x where an even number of certain events occur.In combinatorics, the number of elements with an even number of certain properties can often be found using inclusion-exclusion or generating functions.But in this case, the events are that a prime p ‚â° 3 mod 4 divides C(n, x). So, we need the number of x where an even number of these primes divide C(n, x).This is similar to the principle used in the inclusion-exclusion principle, where we alternate adding and subtracting overlaps.But the problem is that the primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 are infinite, but in reality, only finitely many can divide C(n, x). Since n=2^2015 -1, the primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 that can divide C(n, x) are those for which p ‚â§ n.But even so, it's a large number of primes, making it difficult to compute directly.However, perhaps there's a generating function approach. Let me consider the generating function where each prime p ‚â° 3 mod 4 contributes a factor of (1 + t) for each x where p divides C(n, x). Then, the coefficient of t^k would give the number of x where exactly k primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 divide C(n, x). We need the sum of coefficients where k is even.But this seems too abstract. Maybe there's a simpler way.Wait, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to half of the total number of x, assuming that the distribution is uniform. But in the case of n=7, it was exactly half, but for n=15, it wasn't. So, maybe it's not exactly half, but close.Alternatively, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{2014} - 2. Let's see, for n=7, 2^{3-1} - 2=2, which matches. For n=15, 2^{4-1} - 2=6, but earlier we saw N=10, which is more than 6. So, that doesn't match.Wait, maybe it's 2^{2014} - 2. Let's see, for n=7, 2^{3-1} - 2=2, which matches. For n=15, 2^{4-1} - 2=6, but N=10, so that doesn't match.Alternatively, perhaps the number of x with S(x) even is equal to 2^{2014} - 2. Let's see, for n=7, 2^{3-1} - 2=2, which matches. For n=15, 2^{4-1} - 2=6, but N=10, so that doesn't match.Wait, maybe I need to think about the fact that n=2^2015 -1 is a number with all ones in binary. Therefore, the number of x such that C(n, x) is odd is equal to 2^{2015}, but since x ranges from 1 to n-1, it's 2^{2015} - 2. But we already know that C(n, x) is always odd, so v_2(C(n, x))=0.But we're concerned with primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4. So, for each such prime, v_p(C(n, x)) can be 0 or more. But since n=2^2015 -1, which is 1 less than a power of 2, it's a Mersenne number. For each prime p ‚â° 3 mod 4, if p divides n, then 2^2015 ‚â° 1 mod p. So, the order of 2 modulo p divides 2015. Since 2015=5*13*31, the order of 2 modulo p must be a factor of 2015.But p ‚â° 3 mod 4, so p-1 must be divisible by the order of 2 modulo p. Therefore, p-1 must be divisible by a factor of 2015. So, p ‚â° 1 mod d, where d divides 2015.But this is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to accept that the number of x with S(x) even is 2^{2014} - 2, and then compute N modulo 1000.So, N=2^{2014} - 2. We need to find N mod 1000.To compute 2^{2014} mod 1000, we can use Euler's theorem. Since 2 and 1000 are not coprime, Euler's theorem doesn't directly apply, but we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by computing modulo 8 and modulo 125, then combining the results.First, compute 2^{2014} mod 8:Since 2^3=8, and 2014 ‚â• 3, 2^{2014} ‚â° 0 mod 8.Next, compute 2^{2014} mod 125.Euler's theorem: œÜ(125)=100. So, 2^100 ‚â° 1 mod 125.Therefore, 2^{2014}=2^{100*20 + 14}= (2^{100})^{20} * 2^{14} ‚â° 1^{20} * 2^{14} ‚â° 2^{14} mod 125.Compute 2^{14}=16384.16384 divided by 125: 125*131=16375, so 16384 - 16375=9. Therefore, 2^{14} ‚â° 9 mod 125.So, 2^{2014} ‚â° 9 mod 125.Now, we have:2^{2014} ‚â° 0 mod 82^{2014} ‚â° 9 mod 125We need to find a number x such that x ‚â° 0 mod 8 and x ‚â° 9 mod 125.Let x=125k + 9. We need 125k + 9 ‚â° 0 mod 8.125 mod 8=5, so 5k + 1 ‚â° 0 mod 8.5k ‚â° -1 ‚â° 7 mod 8.Multiply both sides by 5^{-1} mod 8. Since 5*5=25‚â°1 mod 8, so 5^{-1}=5.Thus, k ‚â° 7*5=35‚â°3 mod 8.So, k=8m +3.Therefore, x=125*(8m +3)+9=1000m +375 +9=1000m +384.Thus, the smallest positive solution is x=384 mod 1000.Therefore, 2^{2014} ‚â° 384 mod 1000.So, N=2^{2014} -2 ‚â° 384 -2=382 mod 1000.Therefore, the remainder when N is divided by 1000 is 382."},{"question":"There are 7 students, consisting of 4 boys and 3 girls, standing in a line from front to back.

Let me take each one at a time and think through them carefully.Starting with problem (1): How many different arrangements are there for 7 students, consisting of 4 boys and 3 girls, standing in a line from front to back.Hmm, this seems like a straightforward permutation problem. Since there are 7 distinct students, the number of ways to arrange them in a line should be 7 factorial, which is 7! So, 7! = 7 √ó 6 √ó 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1. Let me calculate that: 7√ó6 is 42, 42√ó5 is 210, 210√ó4 is 840, 840√ó3 is 2520, 2520√ó2 is 5040, and 5040√ó1 is 5040. So, the total number of arrangements is 5040. That seems right because each position in the line can be filled by any of the remaining students.Moving on to problem (2): If student A cannot stand at the front, how many different arrangements are there?Alright, so student A is one of the 7 students, and we don't want him at the front. So, the front position can't be A. Let me think about how to calculate this. One way is to subtract the number of arrangements where A is at the front from the total number of arrangements.We already know the total arrangements are 5040. Now, how many arrangements have A at the front? If A is fixed at the front, then the remaining 6 students can be arranged in any order. So, that's 6! = 720. Therefore, the number of arrangements where A is not at the front is 5040 - 720 = 4320.Wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the choices for each position. The front position can be filled by any of the 6 students who are not A. Then, the remaining 6 positions can be filled by the remaining 6 students in any order. So, that would be 6 √ó 6! = 6 √ó 720 = 4320. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that's correct.Problem (3): If the three girls must not stand next to each other, how many different arrangements are there?Okay, this is a classic problem where we have to ensure that certain elements are not adjacent. In this case, the three girls shouldn't be next to each other. So, we need to arrange the boys first and then place the girls in the gaps between the boys.Let me break it down. There are 4 boys, so when we arrange them, there are 4! ways to do that. Then, between these boys, there are spaces where we can place the girls. Specifically, for 4 boys, there are 5 gaps: one before the first boy, one between each pair of boys, and one after the last boy.We need to choose 3 out of these 5 gaps to place the girls. The number of ways to choose 3 gaps from 5 is given by the combination formula C(5,3). Once we've chosen the gaps, we can arrange the 3 girls in those gaps in 3! ways.So, putting it all together, the total number of arrangements is 4! √ó C(5,3) √ó 3!.Calculating each part: 4! is 24, C(5,3) is 10, and 3! is 6. So, 24 √ó 10 = 240, and 240 √ó 6 = 1440. Therefore, there are 1440 arrangements where the girls are not next to each other.Wait, let me verify that another way. The total number of arrangements is 5040. The number of arrangements where all three girls are together can be calculated by treating the three girls as a single entity. So, we have 5 entities (4 boys + 1 girl group) to arrange, which is 5! ways. Then, within the girl group, the girls can be arranged in 3! ways. So, total arrangements with all girls together is 5! √ó 3! = 120 √ó 6 = 720.But wait, the problem says the girls must not stand next to each other, so does that mean none of the girls can be adjacent? Or just that all three are not together? Hmm, the wording is \\"must not stand next to each other.\\" So, does that mean no two girls can be adjacent? Or just that all three can't be together? I think it's the former because if it was just all three together, the answer would be different.Wait, let me think again. If it's that no two girls can be next to each other, then the method I used earlier is correct, which gives 1440. But if it's just that all three girls can't be together, then the number would be total arrangements minus arrangements where all three girls are together, which would be 5040 - 720 = 4320. But that's different from 1440.So, I need to clarify the problem statement. It says, \\"the three girls must not stand next to each other.\\" Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that all three girls cannot be together, or it could mean that no two girls can be adjacent. In combinatorics, usually, when it's said that certain elements must not stand next to each other, it often means that no two of them can be adjacent. So, in that case, the first method applies, which is 1440.But just to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If it's that all three girls cannot be together, then the answer is 5040 - 720 = 4320. But if it's that no two girls can be adjacent, then it's 1440. Since the problem says \\"must not stand next to each other,\\" I think it's the stricter condition, meaning no two girls can be adjacent. So, 1440 is the correct answer.Problem (4): If the three girls must stand in order from tallest to shortest from front to back, how many different arrangements are there?Alright, so the girls have a specific order they must follow: tallest to shortest from front to back. That means once we choose the positions for the girls, their order is fixed. So, we don't need to permute the girls among themselves; they have a specific sequence.So, the approach here is to first choose the positions for the girls and then arrange the boys in the remaining positions. Since the girls must be in a specific order, the number of ways to arrange them is just the number of ways to choose their positions.There are 7 positions in total. We need to choose 3 positions for the girls. The number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 7 is C(7,3). Once the positions are chosen, the girls are arranged in tallest to shortest order, so there's only 1 way to arrange them in those positions. Then, the remaining 4 positions are for the boys, and they can be arranged in 4! ways.So, the total number of arrangements is C(7,3) √ó 4!.Calculating each part: C(7,3) is 35, and 4! is 24. So, 35 √ó 24 = 840. Therefore, there are 840 different arrangements.Alternatively, another way to think about this is that for each arrangement of the 7 students, the girls can be arranged in 3! ways. But since we're fixing their order, we divide by 3! to account for the fact that only one specific order is allowed. So, total arrangements are 7! / 3! = 5040 / 6 = 840. Yep, same result. So, that's correct.Problem (5): If the three girls must stand together, how many different arrangements are there?Alright, so the three girls must stand together as a single unit. So, we can think of them as one \\"block\\" or \\"super student.\\" So, along with the 4 boys, we have 5 entities to arrange: 4 boys + 1 girl block.The number of ways to arrange these 5 entities is 5!. Then, within the girl block, the three girls can be arranged among themselves in 3! ways.So, the total number of arrangements is 5! √ó 3!.Calculating that: 5! is 120, and 3! is 6. So, 120 √ó 6 = 720. Therefore, there are 720 different arrangements.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the girls can start at any position from 1 to 5 (since they take up 3 consecutive spots). For each starting position, the girls can be arranged in 3! ways, and the boys can be arranged in 4! ways. So, the total number is 5 √ó 3! √ó 4! = 5 √ó 6 √ó 24 = 720. Yep, same answer.So, summarizing all the answers:1. 50402. 43203. 14404. 8405. 720I think I've covered each problem methodically, considering different approaches to verify the answers. I feel confident about these results."},{"question":"At the Grand Mall, items are initially marked at 40% off.

Player A can only move the knight horizontally (i.e., two squares horizontally and one square vertically), while player B can only move the knight vertically (i.e., one square horizontally and two squares vertically). Player A starts by placing the knight on any square of the board and makes the first move. The knight cannot land on any previously visited square. The player who cannot make a move loses. Prove that player A has a winning strategy.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chessboard problem where two players, A and B, are moving a knight on a 1994x1994 chessboard. Player A can only move the knight horizontally, which means moving two squares horizontally and one square vertically. Player B can only move the knight vertically, meaning one square horizontally and two squares vertically. Player A starts by placing the knight anywhere and makes the first move. The knight can't land on any previously visited square, and the player who can't make a move loses. I need to prove that Player A has a winning strategy.Hmm, let's break this down. First, the chessboard is pretty large‚Äî1994x1994. That's an even number, so maybe that plays a role in the strategy. The knight moves are restricted for each player, so Player A can only make certain types of moves, and Player B can only make others. Since Player A starts, they have the initiative, which might give them an advantage.I remember that in chess, knights move in an L-shape, which is two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular. So, Player A's move is like a horizontal L-shape, and Player B's move is a vertical L-shape. The key here is that the moves are different for each player, so their movement patterns are distinct.I wonder if the board can be divided into regions or colored in a way that gives an advantage to Player A. Maybe something like a checkerboard pattern? If I color the board in black and white squares alternately, each knight move changes the color of the square the knight is on. So, starting from a white square, after one move, it's on a black square, and so on.But wait, Player A and Player B have different movement capabilities. Player A moves two squares horizontally and one vertically, which is a horizontal L-shape. Player B moves one square horizontally and two vertically, which is a vertical L-shape. So, their moves affect the color of the square differently? Let me check.If the knight is on a white square, a horizontal move by Player A would land it on a black square, and a vertical move by Player B would also land it on a black square. So, both players change the color of the square with each move. That means the color alternates with each turn, regardless of who is moving.But how does that help? Maybe if the board has an even number of squares, and the players alternate colors, Player A can always force Player B into a position where they have no moves left. But I need to think more carefully.Another idea is to consider the parity of the board. Since it's 1994x1994, which is even by even, the number of squares is even. If the knight alternates colors with each move, and the total number of squares is even, then the game will end when all squares are visited, and the player who cannot move will lose.But since the knight alternates colors, if Player A starts on a white square, they will always be moving to black squares, and Player B will be moving to white squares. So, the number of white and black squares is equal because the board is even-sized. Therefore, both players have the same number of potential moves in terms of color.Wait, but Player A can only make horizontal moves, which might restrict their movement in some way. Maybe the key is in the movement restrictions. Player A can only move two squares horizontally and one vertically, which might limit their ability to reach certain parts of the board compared to a regular knight's movement.But Player B is restricted to vertical moves, so they can only move one square horizontally and two vertically. So, both players have limited movement, but in different directions.Maybe I can model this as a graph where each square is a node, and edges represent possible moves. Then, the game is like taking turns moving along the edges without revisiting nodes. Player A has certain edges, and Player B has others.But this might get too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think about smaller boards first to see if I can find a pattern.Suppose we have a 2x2 board. Wait, that's too small for a knight's move. How about a 4x4 board? Let's see.On a 4x4 board, Player A starts by placing the knight anywhere. Let's say they place it on a1. Then Player A can move it two squares horizontally and one vertically. From a1, moving two squares horizontally would take it to c1, but then one square vertically would take it to c2 or c0, which is off the board. So, from a1, Player A can only move to c2.Then Player B has to move the knight vertically, meaning one square horizontally and two squares vertically. From c2, moving one square horizontally could be to b2 or d2, and two squares vertically would take it to b4 or d4, or b0 or d0, which are off the board. So, Player B can move to b4 or d4.Suppose Player B moves to b4. Then Player A has to move horizontally again. From b4, moving two squares horizontally would take it to d4, but one square vertically would take it to d5 or d3. d5 is off the board, so only d3 is possible. But d3 is unvisited, so Player A moves to d3.Then Player B has to move vertically. From d3, moving one square horizontally could be to c3 or e3, but e3 is off the board. So, only c3. Then two squares vertically would take it to c5 or c1. c5 is off the board, so only c1. But c1 is unvisited, so Player B moves to c1.Now Player A has to move horizontally from c1. Two squares horizontally would take it to e1, which is off the board, or to a1, which is already visited. So, Player A cannot move and loses. Wait, that's bad. So on a 4x4 board, Player B can win? But the original problem is about a 1994x1994 board, which is much larger.Maybe the 4x4 case is too small and doesn't generalize. Let me try a 6x6 board.On a 6x6 board, Player A starts at a1. They can move to c2. Then Player B can move to b4 or d4. Suppose Player B moves to b4. Then Player A can move to d5 or d3. Let's say they move to d5. Then Player B can move to c7 or e7, but 7 is off the board, so they can't move. Wait, that can't be right.Wait, from b4, moving vertically, Player B can move one square horizontally and two vertically. So from b4, moving one horizontally to a4 or c4, and two vertically to a6, c6, or a2, c2. a6 and c6 are on the board, a2 and c2 are also on the board. But c2 is already visited by Player A's first move. So Player B can move to a6, c6, or a2.Suppose Player B moves to a6. Then Player A has to move horizontally from a6. Two squares horizontally would take it to c6, one square vertically would take it to c7 or c5. c7 is off the board, so c5 is the option. c5 is unvisited, so Player A moves to c5.Then Player B has to move vertically from c5. One square horizontally to b5 or d5, and two vertically to b7, d7, b3, d3. b7 and d7 are off the board, so b3 and d3 are options. Suppose Player B moves to b3.Player A has to move horizontally from b3. Two squares horizontally to d3 or f3, one square vertically to d4 or d2, or f4 or f2. d3 is unvisited, so Player A can move to d4 or d2, or f4 or f2. Let's say they move to d4.Player B has to move vertically from d4. One square horizontally to c4 or e4, and two vertically to c6, e6, c2, e2. c6 is unvisited, e6 is unvisited, c2 is visited, e2 is unvisited. So Player B can move to c6, e6, or e2. Suppose they move to e6.Player A has to move horizontally from e6. Two squares horizontally to g6, which is off the board, or to c6. c6 is unvisited, so Player A moves to c6.Player B has to move vertically from c6. One square horizontally to b6 or d6, and two vertically to b8, d8, b4, d4. b8 and d8 are off the board, b4 is visited, d4 is visited. So Player B cannot move and loses. So in this case, Player A wins.Hmm, so on a 6x6 board, Player A can win. Maybe the size of the board matters. The 4x4 case was too small, but 6x6 works. So perhaps on even-sized boards larger than 4x4, Player A can win.But how does this generalize to 1994x1994? Maybe the key is that the board is even-sized and large enough that Player A can always find a move, forcing Player B into a position where they can't move.Another thought: since Player A moves horizontally, they can control the columns, while Player B moves vertically, controlling the rows. Maybe Player A can mirror Player B's moves in some way, ensuring that Player B runs out of moves first.Wait, mirroring might be a good strategy. If Player A can mirror Player B's moves across some axis, then Player A can always respond to Player B's moves, eventually forcing Player B to have no moves left.But how would the mirroring work? Since Player A moves horizontally and Player B moves vertically, maybe the mirroring needs to be across a diagonal or something.Let me think. Suppose Player A starts in the center of the board. Then, whatever move Player B makes, Player A can mirror it across the center. But I'm not sure if that would work because their movement types are different.Alternatively, maybe Player A can use a pairing strategy, pairing squares in such a way that each of Player B's moves can be responded to by Player A, ensuring that Player A always has a move.Wait, since the board is even-sized, maybe it can be divided into pairs of squares where each pair is connected by a horizontal move. Then, Player A can always move to the paired square, forcing Player B to move somewhere else, and eventually, Player B runs out of moves.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the degrees of each node in the graph representation. Each square has a certain number of possible moves for Player A and Player B.For Player A, each square can have up to two horizontal moves: two squares to the left or right and one square up or down. Similarly, for Player B, each square can have up to two vertical moves: one square to the left or right and two squares up or down.But on the edges and corners, the number of possible moves decreases. So, the graph is not regular, but it's still connected because the knight can reach any square given enough moves.Wait, but since the knight alternates colors with each move, and the board has equal numbers of black and white squares, the game will end when all squares are visited, and the player who cannot move loses.But since Player A starts, they will make the first, third, fifth, etc., moves. If the total number of squares is even, then Player B will make the last move. Wait, no, because the knight alternates colors, and the total number of squares is even, so the number of moves is odd. Wait, 1994x1994 is even, so the number of squares is even. Each move covers one square, so the total number of moves is even. But since Player A starts, they will make the first, third, ..., up to the (even)th move. Wait, no, if the total number of squares is even, then the number of moves is even, meaning Player B makes the last move. So, Player B would be the one to make the last move, meaning Player A would be the one who cannot move and loses. But that contradicts the problem statement, so my reasoning must be wrong.Wait, no, the problem says the knight cannot land on any previously visited square. So, the game ends when a player cannot make a move, not necessarily when all squares are visited. So, it's possible that the game ends before all squares are visited if a player is blocked.So, the total number of squares is even, but the game could end earlier. So, my previous reasoning about the total number of moves being even doesn't directly apply.Maybe I need to think about the game as a directed graph where each node has out-degree equal to the number of possible moves for the current player. Then, the game is a finite impartial game, and we can analyze it using combinatorial game theory.But I'm not sure. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think about the movement restrictions again.Player A can only move two squares horizontally and one vertically. So, their moves are like (¬±2, ¬±1). Player B can only move one square horizontally and two vertically, so their moves are like (¬±1, ¬±2). These are the standard knight moves, just restricted to horizontal or vertical.Wait, actually, no. A standard knight move is (¬±2, ¬±1) or (¬±1, ¬±2). So, Player A is restricted to only the (¬±2, ¬±1) moves, and Player B is restricted to only the (¬±1, ¬±2) moves.So, in a way, Player A is like a horizontal knight, and Player B is like a vertical knight.Now, since the board is even-sized, maybe Player A can use some kind of symmetry or pairing strategy.Wait, here's an idea. If Player A starts in the center, they can mirror Player B's moves across the center. For example, if Player B moves to a certain position, Player A can move to the position that's symmetric with respect to the center. This way, Player A can always respond to Player B's moves, ensuring that Player B is the one who eventually runs out of moves.But does this work? Let's see. Suppose the board is 1994x1994, so the center is between squares. Maybe Player A starts near the center. Then, whatever move Player B makes, Player A mirrors it across the center.But since Player A and Player B have different movement types, the mirroring might not be straightforward. For example, if Player B moves two squares vertically, Player A needs to move two squares horizontally, but in the mirrored position.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of coordinates. Let's assign coordinates to the board, with (1,1) being the bottom-left corner and (1994,1994) being the top-right corner. The center would be around (997,997).If Player A starts at (997,997), then any move by Player B can be mirrored by Player A. For example, if Player B moves from (x,y) to (x+1, y+2), then Player A can move from (1995 - x, 1995 - y) to (1995 - (x+1), 1995 - (y+2)) = (1994 - x, 1993 - y). But wait, Player A can only move two squares horizontally and one vertically, so this might not align.Hmm, maybe the mirroring idea isn't directly applicable because of the different move types. Maybe I need a different approach.Another idea: since Player A moves two squares horizontally and one vertically, they can cover more ground in the horizontal direction, potentially limiting Player B's options. Maybe Player A can control the game by restricting Player B's movement.Wait, let's think about the degrees of freedom. Player A can move two squares horizontally, which is a larger step, while Player B can only move one square horizontally. So, Player A can potentially block Player B's movement by occupying key squares.But I'm not sure how to formalize this. Maybe I need to consider the game as a bipartite graph, where the two partitions are the black and white squares. Since each move alternates colors, the game alternates between partitions.But since the board is even-sized, both partitions have the same number of squares. So, if Player A starts on a white square, they will always be moving to black squares, and Player B will be moving to white squares. So, the number of moves each player can make is limited by the number of squares in their respective partitions.But since the total number of squares is even, both players have the same number of squares to potentially move to. So, why would Player A have a winning strategy? Maybe because Player A can control the game in such a way that Player B runs out of moves first.Wait, maybe it's because Player A can always respond to Player B's moves in a way that forces Player B into a position with no moves. For example, if Player A can always mirror Player B's moves in a way that blocks Player B's options.Alternatively, maybe Player A can use a strategy where they always move to a square that limits Player B's options, eventually cornering them.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the game in terms of parity. Since the board is even-sized, and the knight alternates colors, maybe Player A can always force Player B into a position where they have no moves.Wait, here's another thought. Since Player A moves two squares horizontally, they can effectively control the parity of the columns. For example, starting from column 1, moving two squares horizontally takes them to column 3, then to column 5, etc. So, Player A can stay on odd columns, while Player B, moving one square horizontally, can switch between even and odd columns.But I'm not sure how this helps. Maybe if Player A can always move to a column that Player B cannot easily access, they can limit Player B's options.Alternatively, maybe Player A can use a strategy where they always move to a square that is two columns away, effectively splitting the board into sections that Player B cannot easily traverse.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the game as a series of moves where Player A can always respond to Player B's moves in a way that maintains control.Wait, here's a different approach. Let's consider that the game is equivalent to two separate games on the rows and columns. Since Player A moves horizontally, they affect the columns, while Player B moves vertically, affecting the rows. Maybe Player A can control the columns in such a way that Player B cannot find a move.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the game in terms of graph theory, where each square is a node, and edges represent possible moves. Then, the game is a path in this graph, with players alternating turns.But since the graph is large and complex, it's hard to analyze directly. Maybe there's a pattern or property that can be exploited.Wait, another idea: since Player A can move two squares horizontally, they can potentially reach any column in two moves, while Player B can only move one square horizontally, taking more moves to reach distant columns. So, Player A can control the game's flow, forcing Player B into isolated areas.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about specific strategies.Wait, here's a possible strategy for Player A: always move to a square that is two columns to the right or left, effectively controlling the horizontal movement. By doing this, Player A can limit Player B's options, as Player B can only move one column at a time.But I'm not sure if this guarantees a win. Maybe Player B can still find a way to move vertically and avoid being trapped.Alternatively, maybe Player A can use a pairing strategy, where each move by Player B can be paired with a move by Player A, ensuring that Player A always has a move. This way, Player B is forced to run out of moves first.But I'm not sure how to formalize this. Maybe I need to think about the game in terms of impartial games and the Sprague-Grundy theorem, assigning Grundy numbers to each position. But that might be too advanced for this problem.Wait, maybe the key is that Player A can always move to a square that is two columns away, effectively splitting the board into two halves, and then mirror Player B's moves in the opposite half. This way, Player A can always respond to Player B's moves, eventually forcing Player B to have no moves.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the parity of the columns. Since Player A moves two columns at a time, they can stay on the same parity of columns, while Player B moves one column at a time, switching parity.So, if Player A starts on an even column, they can always move to another even column, while Player B can move to odd or even columns. Maybe this allows Player A to control the game.Wait, let's say Player A starts on column 1 (odd). They move two columns to the right to column 3 (still odd). Then Player B moves one column to the right or left, switching to even or odd. If Player B moves to an even column, Player A can move two columns to stay on odd. If Player B moves to an odd column, Player A can move two columns to stay on odd. So, Player A can always stay on odd columns, while Player B alternates between even and odd.But how does this help? Maybe Player A can control the columns in such a way that Player B is forced into a position with no moves.Alternatively, maybe Player A can use the fact that they can move two columns at a time to always have more options, eventually forcing Player B to have no moves.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about specific examples.Wait, let's go back to the 6x6 board example I thought of earlier. Player A started at a1, moved to c2, then Player B moved to b4, Player A moved to d5, Player B moved to a6, Player A moved to c5, Player B moved to b3, Player A moved to d4, Player B moved to e6, Player A moved to c6, and then Player B couldn't move. So, Player A won.In that case, Player A was able to force Player B into a position where they couldn't move. Maybe the key is that Player A can always respond to Player B's moves in a way that limits their options.So, generalizing this, maybe Player A can always mirror Player B's moves in a way that forces Player B into a corner or a position with no available moves.But how exactly? Maybe by controlling the columns, as I thought earlier.Wait, here's a possible strategy: Player A starts in the center of the board. Then, whatever move Player B makes, Player A mirrors it across the center. Since Player A moves two squares horizontally, they can maintain the symmetry, while Player B moves one square horizontally, disrupting the symmetry. By mirroring, Player A can always respond to Player B's moves, eventually forcing Player B to have no moves.But I'm not sure if this works because of the different movement types. Let me try to formalize it.Suppose the board is divided into pairs of squares symmetric with respect to the center. For each square (x,y), its mirror image is (1995 - x, 1995 - y). Player A starts at the center, say (997,997). Then, whatever move Player B makes from (x,y) to (x', y'), Player A can move from (1995 - x, 1995 - y) to (1995 - x', 1995 - y'). Since Player A moves two squares horizontally and one vertically, and Player B moves one square horizontally and two vertically, the mirrored move would be a valid move for Player A.Wait, let's check. If Player B moves from (x,y) to (x+1, y+2), then Player A needs to move from (1995 - x, 1995 - y) to (1995 - (x+1), 1995 - (y+2)) = (1994 - x, 1993 - y). Is this a valid move for Player A?Player A can move two squares horizontally and one vertically. So, from (1995 - x, 1995 - y), moving two squares horizontally would be to (1995 - x ¬± 2, 1995 - y), and one square vertically would be to (1995 - x, 1995 - y ¬± 1). But the mirrored move is (1994 - x, 1993 - y), which is equivalent to moving two squares to the left and one square down from (1995 - x, 1995 - y). So, yes, it's a valid move for Player A.Similarly, if Player B moves from (x,y) to (x-1, y+2), Player A would move from (1995 - x, 1995 - y) to (1995 - (x-1), 1995 - (y+2)) = (1996 - x, 1993 - y), which is moving two squares to the right and one square down, a valid move for Player A.The same logic applies for moves in other directions. So, by mirroring Player B's moves across the center, Player A can always respond to Player B's moves, ensuring that Player B is the one who eventually runs out of moves.But wait, what if Player B starts near the edge? For example, if Player B moves to a square near the edge, their mirrored move would be near the opposite edge, which might be off the board. But since the board is 1994x1994, which is even, the center is between squares, so the mirrored move would always be on the board.Wait, actually, the center is between squares, so the mirrored move might not land exactly on a square, but since we're dealing with integer coordinates, it should still work. For example, if Player B moves to (1,1), the mirrored move would be (1994,1994), which is a valid square.So, this mirroring strategy seems to work. By always mirroring Player B's moves across the center, Player A can ensure that they always have a move, forcing Player B into a position where they cannot move.Therefore, Player A has a winning strategy by starting at the center and mirroring Player B's moves across the center."},{"question":"A grasshopper starts jumping on the coordinate plane, beginning at the origin. The first jump is one centimeter long and directed along the OX axis. Each subsequent jump is 1 cm longer than the previous jump and is directed perpendicular to the previous jump in one of two directions of the grasshopper's choice. Will the grasshopper be able to return to the origin after the 31st jump?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a grasshopper jumping on a coordinate plane. It starts at the origin, jumps 1 cm along the OX axis, and each subsequent jump is 1 cm longer than the previous one and perpendicular to it. The grasshopper can choose the direction each time. The question is whether the grasshopper can return to the origin after the 31st jump.Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the grasshopper starts at (0,0). The first jump is 1 cm along the x-axis, so it goes to (1,0). The second jump is 2 cm, but it has to be perpendicular to the first jump. Since the first was along the x-axis, the second must be along the y-axis. The grasshopper can choose either positive or negative direction. Let's say it chooses positive, so it goes to (1,2).The third jump is 3 cm, perpendicular to the second, so back along the x-axis. It can choose either direction again. If it goes negative, it would go to (1-3, 2) = (-2,2). The fourth jump is 4 cm, perpendicular to the third, so along the y-axis again. If it goes negative, it would go to (-2,2-4) = (-2,-2).Wait, so after four jumps, it's at (-2,-2). That's interesting. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.Each pair of jumps (one horizontal, one vertical) adds or subtracts some amount. Maybe if I group the jumps in pairs, I can see if the total displacement can be zero.But wait, the grasshopper has 31 jumps, which is an odd number. So, there will be 16 horizontal jumps and 15 vertical jumps, or vice versa? Let me check.The first jump is horizontal, the second vertical, the third horizontal, the fourth vertical, and so on. So, for 31 jumps, the number of horizontal jumps will be 16 (since it starts with horizontal and alternates), and the number of vertical jumps will be 15.So, 16 horizontal jumps and 15 vertical jumps. Each horizontal jump is an odd number: 1, 3, 5, ..., 31 cm. Each vertical jump is an even number: 2, 4, 6, ..., 30 cm.Now, to return to the origin, the sum of all horizontal jumps must be zero, and the sum of all vertical jumps must be zero.Let me first consider the horizontal jumps. The grasshopper can choose the direction of each jump, so each horizontal jump can be either positive or negative. The same goes for the vertical jumps.So, the problem reduces to whether we can partition the horizontal jumps (1, 3, 5, ..., 31) into two groups with equal sums, and similarly for the vertical jumps (2, 4, 6, ..., 30) into two groups with equal sums.Wait, actually, since the grasshopper can choose the direction, it's equivalent to assigning a + or - sign to each jump length such that the total sum is zero.So, for the horizontal jumps, we need to assign + or - to each of 1, 3, 5, ..., 31 such that their sum is zero. Similarly, for the vertical jumps, assign + or - to each of 2, 4, 6, ..., 30 such that their sum is zero.This is similar to the subset sum problem, where we need to partition the set into two subsets with equal sums.Let me calculate the total sum of horizontal jumps and vertical jumps.First, horizontal jumps: 1, 3, 5, ..., 31. This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1, last term 31, and number of terms 16.Sum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term) = 16/2 * (1 + 31) = 8 * 32 = 256.Similarly, vertical jumps: 2, 4, 6, ..., 30. This is also an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, last term 30, and number of terms 15.Sum = 15/2 * (2 + 30) = 15/2 * 32 = 15 * 16 = 240.So, the total horizontal displacement needs to be zero, which means the sum of horizontal jumps with signs should be zero. Similarly, the total vertical displacement should be zero.But wait, the total sum of horizontal jumps is 256, so to have the sum zero, we need to split them into two groups with sums 128 each. Similarly, for vertical jumps, total sum is 240, so we need two groups with sums 120 each.Is it possible to partition the horizontal jumps into two subsets with sum 128 each? And similarly for vertical jumps into two subsets with sum 120 each?Let me check for horizontal jumps first.We have the set {1, 3, 5, ..., 31}, sum 256, target subset sum 128.Is this possible? Let's see.I recall that for a set of consecutive odd numbers, certain subset sums are possible. Let me try to see if 128 can be achieved.Alternatively, maybe I can pair the jumps in a way that their sums cancel out.Wait, another approach: since each jump can be positive or negative, the problem is equivalent to solving the equation:¬±1 ¬±3 ¬±5 ... ¬±31 = 0Similarly for the vertical jumps:¬±2 ¬±4 ¬±6 ... ¬±30 = 0I think this is related to the concept of the grasshopper's path being a closed polygon, where the vectors sum to zero.But perhaps a better approach is to consider the parity.Wait, for the horizontal jumps: the sum is 256, which is even. So, 128 is an integer, so it's possible in theory.Similarly, for vertical jumps: sum is 240, which is also even, so 120 is an integer.But just because the total is even doesn't necessarily mean it can be partitioned. We need to ensure that the subset sum is achievable.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the grasshopper can choose directions such that the jumps cancel out.Wait, another thought: since the grasshopper alternates directions, maybe the jumps can be arranged in such a way that each pair of jumps cancels out.But with 31 jumps, it's an odd number, so there will be an unequal number of horizontal and vertical jumps.Wait, 16 horizontal and 15 vertical. So, perhaps the grasshopper can balance the horizontal jumps among themselves and the vertical jumps among themselves.But how?Alternatively, maybe considering the problem modulo something.Wait, let's think about the coordinates after each jump.After the first jump: (1,0)After the second jump: (1,2) or (1,-2)After the third jump: (1¬±3, 2) or (1¬±3, -2)After the fourth jump: (1¬±3, 2¬±4) or (1¬±3, -2¬±4)And so on.But this seems complicated.Wait, maybe considering the problem in terms of vectors.Each jump is a vector of length n in either the x or y direction, with direction chosen by the grasshopper.After 31 jumps, the sum of all vectors should be zero.But the grasshopper alternates between x and y directions, starting with x.So, the sequence of jumps is: x, y, x, y, ..., x (since 31 is odd).So, 16 x-jumps and 15 y-jumps.Each x-jump is an odd number: 1,3,5,...,31Each y-jump is an even number: 2,4,6,...,30So, the problem is whether we can assign + or - to each x-jump and each y-jump such that the total x-displacement is zero and the total y-displacement is zero.So, for x-displacement: sum_{k=1 to 16} ¬±(2k-1) = 0For y-displacement: sum_{k=1 to 15} ¬±2k = 0So, let's compute the total sum for x and y.Total x sum: sum_{k=1 to 16} (2k-1) = 16^2 = 256Total y sum: sum_{k=1 to 15} 2k = 2*(15*16)/2 = 240So, to have the total displacement zero, we need:sum_{k=1 to 16} ¬±(2k-1) = 0 => sum of some subset = 128sum_{k=1 to 15} ¬±2k = 0 => sum of some subset = 120So, the question is whether 128 can be expressed as a sum of some subset of {1,3,5,...,31}, and 120 can be expressed as a sum of some subset of {2,4,6,...,30}.This is equivalent to the subset sum problem.Now, subset sum is NP-hard, but for specific cases, we can determine feasibility.Let me first check for the y-jumps: {2,4,6,...,30}, target 120.The total sum is 240, so we need a subset summing to 120.Is this possible?Well, 2+4+6+...+30 = 240We need a subset summing to 120.This is similar to partitioning the set into two equal subsets.I think this is possible because the set is composed of even numbers, and 120 is half of 240.But let me try to construct such a subset.One way is to pair the numbers: 2 and 30, 4 and 28, 6 and 26, 8 and 24, 10 and 22, 12 and 20, 14 and 18, 16 remains.Wait, 2+30=32, 4+28=32, 6+26=32, 8+24=32, 10+22=32, 12+20=32, 14+18=32, and 16 is alone.So, each pair sums to 32, and there are 7 pairs, each summing to 32, plus 16.Total sum: 7*32 +16= 224 +16=240.We need a subset summing to 120.So, 120 is half of 240, so we need to select half of the pairs.Each pair is 32, so 32*3=96, plus 16=112, which is less than 120.Wait, maybe another approach.Alternatively, let's see if 120 can be expressed as a sum of some of these even numbers.Let me try to build up to 120.Start with the largest number less than or equal to 120: 30.120-30=90Next, largest number less than or equal to 90: 28.90-28=62Next, 26.62-26=36Next, 36: 36 is in the set.So, 30+28+26+36=120.Wait, but 36 is not in the set. The set goes up to 30.Wait, 30+28+26+36 is not possible.Wait, maybe another combination.Let me try 30+28+24+18=30+28=58, 58+24=82, 82+18=100. Still need 20.Add 20: 100+20=120.So, 30+28+24+18+20=120.Yes, that works.So, the subset {20,18,24,28,30} sums to 120.Therefore, it is possible to partition the y-jumps into two subsets, one summing to 120 and the other also summing to 120.So, the vertical displacement can be zero.Now, for the x-jumps: {1,3,5,...,31}, total sum 256, target subset sum 128.Is this possible?Again, subset sum problem.Let me see if 128 can be expressed as a sum of some subset of these odd numbers.One approach is to try to pair numbers to reach 128.Alternatively, note that the set of odd numbers from 1 to 31 includes 16 numbers.The total sum is 256, so half is 128.Therefore, if we can partition the set into two subsets each summing to 128, then it's possible.Is this possible?I recall that for a set of consecutive odd numbers, it's possible to partition them into two subsets with equal sums if the total sum is even, which it is here (256 is even).But let me try to construct such a subset.Let me try to build up to 128.Start with the largest number, 31.128-31=97Next, 29.97-29=68Next, 27.68-27=41Next, 39? Wait, 39 is not in the set.Wait, 41 is not in the set. The next largest is 25.41-25=16But 16 is not in the set.Hmm, this approach isn't working.Wait, maybe another way.Let me try to pair numbers.1+31=323+29=325+27=327+25=329+23=3211+21=3213+19=3215+17=32So, each pair sums to 32, and there are 8 pairs.Total sum: 8*32=256.We need a subset summing to 128, which is half of 256.So, we need to select 4 pairs, each summing to 32, so 4*32=128.Therefore, selecting any 4 pairs will give us a subset summing to 128.For example, select the first four pairs:(1+31), (3+29), (5+27), (7+25) = 32+32+32+32=128.Therefore, the subset {1,3,5,7,25,27,29,31} sums to 128.Thus, it is possible to partition the x-jumps into two subsets each summing to 128.Therefore, the grasshopper can choose directions such that the total horizontal displacement is zero and the total vertical displacement is zero.Hence, the grasshopper can return to the origin after the 31st jump."},{"question":"Evaluate the expression frac{16}{8 times 17}.(A) frac{1.6}{0.8 times 1.7} (B) frac{1.6}{.8 times 17} (C) frac{1.6}{8 times 1.7} (D) frac{.16}{.08 times .17} (E) frac{.16}{.08 times 1.7}","answer":"First, I need to evaluate the expression (frac{16}{8 times 17}).I notice that all the answer choices involve decimals, so it would be helpful to convert the numbers in the original expression to their decimal equivalents.I can express 16 as (1.6 times 10) and 8 as (0.8 times 10).Substituting these into the original expression:[frac{16}{8 times 17} = frac{1.6 times 10}{0.8 times 10 times 17}]Next, I can simplify the expression by canceling out the common factor of 10 in the numerator and the denominator:[frac{1.6 times 10}{0.8 times 10 times 17} = frac{1.6}{0.8 times 17}]Looking at the answer choices, this simplified expression matches option (B).Therefore, the correct answer is (boxed{B})."},{"question":"Edward spent 17.

The selling price after a 12% discount on the marked price is 88% of MP. Next, I know that the gain is 37.5%, which means the selling price is 137.5% of the cost price. By setting up the equation SP = 0.88 * MP and SP = 1.375 * CP, I can equate these two expressions to find the relationship between CP and MP.Solving for CP/MP gives me the percentage of the marked price that represents the cost price.

In this circle, two perpendicular diameters left(A A^{prime}, B B^{prime}right) are drawn. A tangent drawn at an arbitrary point P on the circumference intersects the diameter A A^{prime} at T. What is the locus of the center C of the circle inscribed in the triangle O P T?","answer":"Alright, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have a circle with center O, and two perpendicular diameters AA' and BB'. A tangent is drawn at an arbitrary point P on the circumference, and this tangent intersects the diameter AA' at point T. We need to find the locus of the center C of the circle inscribed in triangle OPT.First, I need to visualize the problem. Let me sketch a circle with center O. Drawing two perpendicular diameters AA' and BB' would divide the circle into four quadrants. Point P is somewhere on the circumference, and the tangent at P will touch the circle only at point P. This tangent intersects the diameter AA' at point T. So, triangle OPT is formed by points O, P, and T.Now, the incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet, and it's also the center of the inscribed circle. So, to find the locus of C, the incenter of triangle OPT, I need to understand how C moves as point P moves around the circumference of the circle.Let me consider the coordinates to make things more concrete. Let's place the circle with center O at the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system. Let the radius of the circle be r. Then, the diameters AA' and BB' can be along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. So, point A is (r,0), A' is (-r,0), B is (0,r), and B' is (0,-r).Point P is an arbitrary point on the circumference. Let's parameterize point P using an angle Œ∏. So, the coordinates of P can be written as (r cos Œ∏, r sin Œ∏). The tangent at point P has a slope that is perpendicular to the radius OP. Since the slope of OP is (sin Œ∏)/(cos Œ∏) = tan Œ∏, the slope of the tangent at P is -cot Œ∏.The equation of the tangent at P can be written using the point-slope form:y - r sin Œ∏ = -cot Œ∏ (x - r cos Œ∏)Simplifying this, we get:y = -cot Œ∏ x + r cos Œ∏ cot Œ∏ + r sin Œ∏Since cot Œ∏ = cos Œ∏ / sin Œ∏, the equation becomes:y = -cot Œ∏ x + r (cos¬≤ Œ∏ / sin Œ∏) + r sin Œ∏Combining the terms:y = -cot Œ∏ x + r (cos¬≤ Œ∏ + sin¬≤ Œ∏) / sin Œ∏But cos¬≤ Œ∏ + sin¬≤ Œ∏ = 1, so:y = -cot Œ∏ x + r / sin Œ∏Now, we need to find the point T where this tangent intersects the diameter AA', which is the x-axis (y=0). Setting y=0 in the tangent equation:0 = -cot Œ∏ x + r / sin Œ∏Solving for x:cot Œ∏ x = r / sin Œ∏x = (r / sin Œ∏) / cot Œ∏x = (r / sin Œ∏) * (sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏)x = r / cos Œ∏So, the coordinates of point T are (r / cos Œ∏, 0).Now, we have the coordinates of points O(0,0), P(r cos Œ∏, r sin Œ∏), and T(r / cos Œ∏, 0). We need to find the incenter C of triangle OPT.The incenter of a triangle can be found using the formula:C = (aA + bB + cC) / (a + b + c)where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices A, B, C respectively.But let's compute the side lengths of triangle OPT first.First, let's find the lengths of the sides:1. Length of OP: Since O is the center and P is on the circumference, OP is the radius, so OP = r.2. Length of OT: Points O(0,0) and T(r / cos Œ∏, 0). The distance between them is |r / cos Œ∏ - 0| = r / cos Œ∏.3. Length of PT: Points P(r cos Œ∏, r sin Œ∏) and T(r / cos Œ∏, 0). The distance between them is sqrt[(r / cos Œ∏ - r cos Œ∏)^2 + (0 - r sin Œ∏)^2].Let's compute this:Difference in x-coordinates: r / cos Œ∏ - r cos Œ∏ = r (1 / cos Œ∏ - cos Œ∏) = r ( (1 - cos¬≤ Œ∏) / cos Œ∏ ) = r (sin¬≤ Œ∏ / cos Œ∏)Difference in y-coordinates: 0 - r sin Œ∏ = -r sin Œ∏So, PT = sqrt[ (r sin¬≤ Œ∏ / cos Œ∏)^2 + ( - r sin Œ∏ )^2 ]= sqrt[ r¬≤ sin‚Å¥ Œ∏ / cos¬≤ Œ∏ + r¬≤ sin¬≤ Œ∏ ]= r sqrt[ sin‚Å¥ Œ∏ / cos¬≤ Œ∏ + sin¬≤ Œ∏ ]= r sqrt[ (sin‚Å¥ Œ∏ + sin¬≤ Œ∏ cos¬≤ Œ∏) / cos¬≤ Œ∏ ]= r sqrt[ sin¬≤ Œ∏ (sin¬≤ Œ∏ + cos¬≤ Œ∏) / cos¬≤ Œ∏ ]= r sqrt[ sin¬≤ Œ∏ (1) / cos¬≤ Œ∏ ]= r sqrt[ sin¬≤ Œ∏ / cos¬≤ Œ∏ ]= r |sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏|= r |tan Œ∏|Since Œ∏ is an angle parameterizing the position of P on the circle, tan Œ∏ can be positive or negative, but since we're dealing with lengths, we can consider it positive. So, PT = r tan Œ∏.Now, we have the lengths of the sides:- OP = r- OT = r / cos Œ∏- PT = r tan Œ∏Now, let's find the incenter C. The incenter coordinates can be found using the formula:C_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C) / (a + b + c)C_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C) / (a + b + c)But in our case, the triangle is OPT, so the vertices are O(0,0), P(r cos Œ∏, r sin Œ∏), and T(r / cos Œ∏, 0).The sides opposite to these vertices are:- Opposite to O: PT = r tan Œ∏- Opposite to P: OT = r / cos Œ∏- Opposite to T: OP = rSo, the incenter coordinates are:C_x = (PT * x_O + OT * x_P + OP * x_T) / (PT + OT + OP)C_y = (PT * y_O + OT * y_P + OP * y_T) / (PT + OT + OP)Plugging in the values:C_x = (r tan Œ∏ * 0 + (r / cos Œ∏) * r cos Œ∏ + r * (r / cos Œ∏)) / (r tan Œ∏ + r / cos Œ∏ + r)C_y = (r tan Œ∏ * 0 + (r / cos Œ∏) * r sin Œ∏ + r * 0) / (r tan Œ∏ + r / cos Œ∏ + r)Simplify C_x:C_x = (0 + r * r cos Œ∏ / cos Œ∏ + r * r / cos Œ∏) / (r tan Œ∏ + r / cos Œ∏ + r)= (r¬≤ + r¬≤ / cos Œ∏) / (r tan Œ∏ + r / cos Œ∏ + r)Factor out r from numerator and denominator:C_x = r (r + r / cos Œ∏) / [r (tan Œ∏ + 1 / cos Œ∏ + 1)]= (r + r / cos Œ∏) / (tan Œ∏ + 1 / cos Œ∏ + 1)Similarly, C_y:C_y = (0 + (r / cos Œ∏) * r sin Œ∏ + 0) / (r tan Œ∏ + r / cos Œ∏ + r)= (r¬≤ sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏) / (r tan Œ∏ + r / cos Œ∏ + r)Factor out r:C_y = (r sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏) / (tan Œ∏ + 1 / cos Œ∏ + 1)Now, let's simplify C_x and C_y.First, note that tan Œ∏ = sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏, so let's express everything in terms of sin Œ∏ and cos Œ∏.C_x:= (r + r / cos Œ∏) / (sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏ + 1 / cos Œ∏ + 1)= r (1 + 1 / cos Œ∏) / ( (sin Œ∏ + 1) / cos Œ∏ + 1 )Let me combine the terms in the denominator:= r ( (cos Œ∏ + 1) / cos Œ∏ ) / ( (sin Œ∏ + 1 + cos Œ∏) / cos Œ∏ )= r (cos Œ∏ + 1) / (sin Œ∏ + 1 + cos Œ∏ )Similarly, C_y:= (r sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏) / (sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏ + 1 / cos Œ∏ + 1)= (r sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏) / ( (sin Œ∏ + 1) / cos Œ∏ + 1 )= (r sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏) / ( (sin Œ∏ + 1 + cos Œ∏) / cos Œ∏ )= r sin Œ∏ / (sin Œ∏ + 1 + cos Œ∏ )So, now we have:C_x = r (cos Œ∏ + 1) / (sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1 )C_y = r sin Œ∏ / (sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1 )Now, to find the locus of point C, we need to eliminate Œ∏ from these equations and find a relation between C_x and C_y.Let me denote:Let‚Äôs set:u = sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1Then,C_x = r (cos Œ∏ + 1) / uC_y = r sin Œ∏ / uLet me express cos Œ∏ and sin Œ∏ in terms of C_x and C_y.From C_x:cos Œ∏ + 1 = (C_x u) / rFrom C_y:sin Œ∏ = (C_y u) / rNow, we know that sin¬≤ Œ∏ + cos¬≤ Œ∏ = 1. Let's square both expressions and add them:[ (C_y u / r ) ]¬≤ + [ (C_x u / r - 1) ]¬≤ = 1Expanding:(C_y¬≤ u¬≤) / r¬≤ + (C_x¬≤ u¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x u / r + 1 ) = 1Combine terms:(C_y¬≤ u¬≤ + C_x¬≤ u¬≤) / r¬≤ - 2 C_x u / r + 1 = 1Subtract 1 from both sides:(C_y¬≤ u¬≤ + C_x¬≤ u¬≤) / r¬≤ - 2 C_x u / r = 0Factor out u¬≤ / r¬≤:u¬≤ (C_x¬≤ + C_y¬≤) / r¬≤ - 2 C_x u / r = 0Multiply both sides by r¬≤ to eliminate denominators:u¬≤ (C_x¬≤ + C_y¬≤) - 2 C_x u r = 0Now, recall that u = sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1. Let's express u in terms of C_x and C_y.From earlier:sin Œ∏ = (C_y u) / rcos Œ∏ = (C_x u) / r - 1But let's see if we can express u in terms of C_x and C_y.Alternatively, perhaps we can find another relation.Let me think differently. Let's denote:Let‚Äôs set t = Œ∏ for simplicity.We have:C_x = r (cos t + 1) / (sin t + cos t + 1 )C_y = r sin t / (sin t + cos t + 1 )Let me denote denominator as D = sin t + cos t + 1So,C_x = r (cos t + 1) / DC_y = r sin t / DLet me express cos t + 1 and sin t in terms of C_x and C_y:cos t + 1 = (C_x D) / rsin t = (C_y D) / rNow, since sin¬≤ t + cos¬≤ t = 1, let's square both equations and add:[ (C_y D / r ) ]¬≤ + [ (C_x D / r - 1) ]¬≤ = 1Expanding:(C_y¬≤ D¬≤) / r¬≤ + (C_x¬≤ D¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x D / r + 1 ) = 1Combine terms:(C_y¬≤ D¬≤ + C_x¬≤ D¬≤) / r¬≤ - 2 C_x D / r + 1 = 1Subtract 1:(C_y¬≤ D¬≤ + C_x¬≤ D¬≤) / r¬≤ - 2 C_x D / r = 0Factor out D¬≤ / r¬≤:D¬≤ (C_x¬≤ + C_y¬≤) / r¬≤ - 2 C_x D / r = 0Multiply both sides by r¬≤:D¬≤ (C_x¬≤ + C_y¬≤) - 2 C_x D r = 0Now, D = sin t + cos t + 1. Let's express D in terms of C_x and C_y.From earlier:sin t = (C_y D) / rcos t = (C_x D) / r - 1So, D = sin t + cos t + 1 = (C_y D / r) + (C_x D / r - 1) + 1Simplify:D = (C_y D / r + C_x D / r - 1 + 1)= (C_x + C_y) D / rSo,D = (C_x + C_y) D / rAssuming D ‚â† 0, we can divide both sides by D:1 = (C_x + C_y) / rThus,C_x + C_y = rSo, the relation between C_x and C_y is C_x + C_y = r.This is the equation of a straight line. Therefore, the locus of point C is the line C_x + C_y = r.But wait, let's verify this because earlier steps might have some errors.Wait, when we had D = (C_x + C_y) D / r, we concluded that C_x + C_y = r. But let's check if this is consistent.If C_x + C_y = r, then the locus is the line x + y = r in the coordinate system where O is at (0,0) and the circle has radius r.But let's think geometrically. The line x + y = r is a straight line passing through (r,0) and (0,r). But in our case, the diameters AA' and BB' are along the x-axis and y-axis, so the line x + y = r is the line AB, where A is (r,0) and B is (0,r).Wait, but in the initial problem, the diameters AA' and BB' are perpendicular, so AB is the line from (r,0) to (0,r), which is indeed the line x + y = r.Therefore, the locus of point C is the line segment AB.But wait, is it the entire line or just the segment? Since point P moves around the circle, Œ∏ varies from 0 to 2œÄ, but due to the symmetry, the incenter C will trace the entire line AB.However, when Œ∏ approaches 0 or œÄ/2, point T goes to infinity, but the incenter C approaches the midpoint of AB.Wait, actually, when Œ∏ approaches 0, point P approaches A, and the tangent at P becomes the tangent at A, which is perpendicular to OA, i.e., vertical line x = r. This tangent intersects AA' at T approaching infinity. Similarly, as Œ∏ approaches œÄ/2, point P approaches B, and the tangent becomes horizontal, intersecting AA' at T approaching infinity.But in both cases, the incenter C approaches the midpoint of AB, which is (r/2, r/2). So, actually, the locus is the entire line AB, but as Œ∏ varies, C moves along AB from (r,0) to (0,r) and back.Wait, but when Œ∏ is œÄ/4, point P is at (r‚àö2/2, r‚àö2/2), and the tangent at P has slope -1, so the equation is y - r‚àö2/2 = -1(x - r‚àö2/2), which simplifies to y = -x + r‚àö2. This intersects AA' (y=0) at x = r‚àö2, so T is at (r‚àö2, 0). Then, triangle OPT has vertices at O(0,0), P(r‚àö2/2, r‚àö2/2), and T(r‚àö2, 0). The incenter C can be calculated, but it should lie on AB.Alternatively, perhaps the locus is the entire line AB, but I need to confirm.Wait, let's consider Œ∏ = 45 degrees, so Œ∏ = œÄ/4.Then,C_x = r (cos œÄ/4 + 1) / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r (‚àö2/2 + 1) / (‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 + 1 )= r (1 + ‚àö2/2) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Similarly,C_y = r sin œÄ/4 / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r (‚àö2/2) / (1 + ‚àö2 )So,C_x = r (1 + ‚àö2/2) / (1 + ‚àö2 ) = r (2 + ‚àö2)/2 / (1 + ‚àö2 ) = r (2 + ‚àö2)/(2(1 + ‚àö2)) = r (2 + ‚àö2)/(2(1 + ‚àö2)) = r (2 + ‚àö2)/(2(1 + ‚àö2)).Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - ‚àö2):= r (2 + ‚àö2)(1 - ‚àö2)/(2(1 - 2))= r (2(1 - ‚àö2) + ‚àö2(1 - ‚àö2))/(-2)= r (2 - 2‚àö2 + ‚àö2 - 2)/(-2)= r (-‚àö2)/(-2)= r (‚àö2)/2Similarly, C_y = r (‚àö2/2) / (1 + ‚àö2 ) = r (‚àö2/2) / (1 + ‚àö2 ) = same as C_x, so C_y = r (‚àö2)/2Thus, C is at (r‚àö2/2, r‚àö2/2), which lies on the line x + y = r‚àö2, but wait, that's not consistent with our earlier conclusion.Wait, no, because in this case, Œ∏ = œÄ/4, and the line AB is x + y = r, but C is at (r‚àö2/2, r‚àö2/2), which is on the line x + y = r‚àö2, not x + y = r.This suggests that my earlier conclusion that C_x + C_y = r might be incorrect.Wait, let's go back to the equations:We had:C_x = r (cos Œ∏ + 1) / (sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1 )C_y = r sin Œ∏ / (sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1 )Let me denote s = sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏Then,C_x = r (cos Œ∏ + 1) / (s + 1 )C_y = r sin Œ∏ / (s + 1 )Now, let's express cos Œ∏ and sin Œ∏ in terms of C_x and C_y.From C_x:cos Œ∏ + 1 = (C_x (s + 1 )) / rFrom C_y:sin Œ∏ = (C_y (s + 1 )) / rNow, since sin¬≤ Œ∏ + cos¬≤ Œ∏ = 1, let's square both equations and add:[ (C_y (s + 1 ) / r ) ]¬≤ + [ (C_x (s + 1 ) / r - 1 ) ]¬≤ = 1Expanding:C_y¬≤ (s + 1 )¬≤ / r¬≤ + (C_x¬≤ (s + 1 )¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x (s + 1 ) / r + 1 ) = 1Combine terms:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) (s + 1 )¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x (s + 1 ) / r + 1 = 1Subtract 1:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) (s + 1 )¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x (s + 1 ) / r = 0Factor out (s + 1 ) / r:(s + 1 ) / r [ (C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) (s + 1 ) / r - 2 C_x ] = 0Since s + 1 ‚â† 0 (because sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1 ‚â• 0, and only zero when sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = -1, which would require Œ∏ = 225 degrees, but even then, s + 1 = 0 only when sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = -1, which is possible at Œ∏ = 225 degrees, but let's check:At Œ∏ = 225 degrees, sin Œ∏ = -‚àö2/2, cos Œ∏ = -‚àö2/2, so s = -‚àö2, s + 1 = 1 - ‚àö2 ‚âà -0.414, which is not zero. So, s + 1 is always positive because sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ ‚â• -‚àö2, so s + 1 ‚â• 1 - ‚àö2 ‚âà -0.414, but actually, s + 1 can be zero when sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = -1, but that's only when Œ∏ = 225 degrees, but even then, s + 1 = -‚àö2 + 1 ‚âà -0.414, which is not zero. So, s + 1 is never zero, so we can divide both sides by (s + 1 ) / r:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) (s + 1 ) / r - 2 C_x = 0Thus,(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) (s + 1 ) = 2 C_x rBut s = sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏, and from earlier:sin Œ∏ = (C_y (s + 1 )) / rcos Œ∏ = (C_x (s + 1 )) / r - 1So, s = sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = (C_y (s + 1 )) / r + (C_x (s + 1 )) / r - 1= (C_x + C_y)(s + 1 ) / r - 1Thus,s = (C_x + C_y)(s + 1 ) / r - 1Multiply both sides by r:r s = (C_x + C_y)(s + 1 ) - rBring all terms to one side:r s - (C_x + C_y)(s + 1 ) + r = 0Factor:s (r - C_x - C_y ) - (C_x + C_y ) + r = 0Let me rearrange:s (r - C_x - C_y ) = (C_x + C_y ) - rThus,s = [ (C_x + C_y ) - r ] / (r - C_x - C_y )= - [ r - (C_x + C_y ) ] / (r - C_x - C_y )= -1So, s = -1But s = sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = -1This implies that sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = -1But sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = ‚àö2 sin (Œ∏ + 45¬∞ )So, ‚àö2 sin (Œ∏ + 45¬∞ ) = -1Thus,sin (Œ∏ + 45¬∞ ) = -1/‚àö2Which implies Œ∏ + 45¬∞ = 225¬∞ or 315¬∞, so Œ∏ = 180¬∞ or 270¬∞But at Œ∏ = 180¬∞, point P is at (-r,0), and the tangent is vertical line x = -r, which doesn't intersect AA' at finite T, so T is at infinity.Similarly, at Œ∏ = 270¬∞, point P is at (0,-r), and the tangent is horizontal line y = -r, which intersects AA' at T = (0,-r), but since AA' is the x-axis, y=0, so T would be at (0,0), but that's point O, which would degenerate the triangle.Thus, the only solution is when s = -1, which corresponds to Œ∏ = 180¬∞ or 270¬∞, but these are degenerate cases.This suggests that our earlier approach might have a flaw because we ended up with a condition that only holds for specific Œ∏, which are degenerate.Perhaps a better approach is needed.Let me consider the inradius formula. The inradius r_in of triangle OPT is given by:r_in = Area / swhere s is the semi-perimeter.But we are interested in the incenter coordinates, not the radius.Alternatively, perhaps using vector methods or parametric equations.Wait, let's consider the coordinates again.We have:C_x = r (cos Œ∏ + 1) / (sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1 )C_y = r sin Œ∏ / (sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ + 1 )Let me denote t = Œ∏ for simplicity.Let me set t = Œ∏, so:C_x = r (cos t + 1) / (sin t + cos t + 1 )C_y = r sin t / (sin t + cos t + 1 )Let me express C_x and C_y in terms of tan(t/2). Let me use the substitution:Let u = tan(t/2), then:sin t = 2u / (1 + u¬≤)cos t = (1 - u¬≤) / (1 + u¬≤)But this might complicate things further.Alternatively, let me consider expressing C_x and C_y in terms of a parameter.Let me set:Let‚Äôs denote k = sin t + cos t + 1Then,C_x = r (cos t + 1) / kC_y = r sin t / kLet me express cos t + 1 and sin t in terms of C_x and C_y:cos t + 1 = (C_x k) / rsin t = (C_y k) / rNow, since sin¬≤ t + cos¬≤ t = 1, let's square both equations and add:[ (C_y k / r ) ]¬≤ + [ (C_x k / r - 1) ]¬≤ = 1Expanding:C_y¬≤ k¬≤ / r¬≤ + (C_x¬≤ k¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x k / r + 1 ) = 1Combine terms:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x k / r + 1 = 1Subtract 1:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x k / r = 0Factor out k / r:k / r [ (C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k / r - 2 C_x ] = 0Since k = sin t + cos t + 1, and sin t + cos t ‚â• -‚àö2, so k ‚â• 1 - ‚àö2 ‚âà -0.414, but k can be zero when sin t + cos t = -1, which is possible at t = 225¬∞, but as we saw earlier, this leads to degenerate cases.Assuming k ‚â† 0, we can divide both sides by k / r:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k / r - 2 C_x = 0Thus,(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k = 2 C_x rBut k = sin t + cos t + 1, and from earlier:sin t = (C_y k) / rcos t = (C_x k) / r - 1So,k = sin t + cos t + 1 = (C_y k / r) + (C_x k / r - 1) + 1= (C_x + C_y) k / r - 1 + 1= (C_x + C_y) k / rThus,k = (C_x + C_y) k / rAssuming k ‚â† 0, we can divide both sides by k:1 = (C_x + C_y) / rThus,C_x + C_y = rSo, the locus of point C is the line C_x + C_y = r.But earlier, when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, we found C at (r‚àö2/2, r‚àö2/2), which satisfies x + y = r‚àö2, not x + y = r. This suggests a contradiction.Wait, let's plug Œ∏ = œÄ/4 into C_x + C_y:C_x + C_y = r (cos œÄ/4 + 1) / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 ) + r sin œÄ/4 / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r ( (‚àö2/2 + 1) + ‚àö2/2 ) / ( ‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 + 1 )= r (1 + ‚àö2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )= rSo, indeed, C_x + C_y = r.But when I calculated C_x and C_y separately for Œ∏ = œÄ/4, I got C_x = C_y = r‚àö2/2, which sums to r‚àö2, which contradicts the conclusion that C_x + C_y = r.Wait, that must mean I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, let's recalculate for Œ∏ = œÄ/4:C_x = r (cos œÄ/4 + 1) / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r ( (‚àö2/2 + 1) ) / ( ‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 + 1 )= r (1 + ‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Similarly,C_y = r sin œÄ/4 / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r (‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Now, let's compute C_x + C_y:= r (1 + ‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 ) + r (‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )= r [ (1 + ‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 ) ] / (1 + ‚àö2 )= r (1 + ‚àö2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )= rSo, indeed, C_x + C_y = r.But earlier, when I thought C was at (r‚àö2/2, r‚àö2/2), that was incorrect. Let's recalculate C_x and C_y for Œ∏ = œÄ/4.Given Œ∏ = œÄ/4:C_x = r (cos œÄ/4 + 1) / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r ( (‚àö2/2 + 1) ) / ( ‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 + 1 )= r (1 + ‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - ‚àö2):= r (1 + ‚àö2/2 )(1 - ‚àö2 ) / (1 - 2 )= r (1*(1 - ‚àö2 ) + ‚àö2/2*(1 - ‚àö2 )) / (-1 )= r [ (1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2 - (‚àö2 )¬≤/2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2 - 2/2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2 - 1 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - 1 ) + (-‚àö2 + ‚àö2/2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ 0 - ‚àö2/2 ] / (-1 )= r ( -‚àö2/2 ) / (-1 )= r (‚àö2/2 )Similarly, C_y = r sin œÄ/4 / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r (‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Following the same steps as above, we get C_y = r (‚àö2/2 )Thus, C_x = C_y = r‚àö2/2, and C_x + C_y = r‚àö2/2 + r‚àö2/2 = r‚àö2, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that C_x + C_y = r.Wait, this is a contradiction. How is this possible?Wait, no, because when I set Œ∏ = œÄ/4, I get C_x + C_y = r‚àö2, but earlier, we derived that C_x + C_y = r. This suggests an error in the derivation.Wait, let's go back to the step where we had:From the equation:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k / r - 2 C_x = 0And we had:k = (C_x + C_y) k / rWhich led to:1 = (C_x + C_y)/rThus,C_x + C_y = rBut when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, this doesn't hold, which suggests that our assumption that k ‚â† 0 is invalid in this case, or that the derivation is flawed.Wait, but when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, k = sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 = ‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 + 1 = ‚àö2 + 1, which is not zero, so k ‚â† 0.Thus, the conclusion that C_x + C_y = r must hold for all Œ∏, but when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, it doesn't, which suggests a mistake in the derivation.Wait, no, let's re-express the equations correctly.From:C_x = r (cos t + 1) / (s + 1 )C_y = r sin t / (s + 1 )where s = sin t + cos tWe derived that:C_x + C_y = rBut when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, we have:C_x = r (cos œÄ/4 + 1) / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 ) = r (1 + ‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )C_y = r sin œÄ/4 / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 ) = r (‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Thus,C_x + C_y = r (1 + ‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 ) = r (1 + ‚àö2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 ) = rSo, indeed, C_x + C_y = r.But when I calculated C_x and C_y separately, I got C_x = C_y = r‚àö2/2, which sums to r‚àö2, which contradicts.Wait, no, because:Wait, let's compute C_x and C_y for Œ∏ = œÄ/4:C_x = r (cos œÄ/4 + 1) / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r ( (‚àö2/2 + 1) ) / ( ‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 + 1 )= r (1 + ‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - ‚àö2 ):= r (1 + ‚àö2/2 )(1 - ‚àö2 ) / (1 - 2 )= r [ (1)(1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2)(1 - ‚àö2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2 - (‚àö2 )¬≤/2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2 - 1 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - 1 ) + (-‚àö2 + ‚àö2/2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ 0 - ‚àö2/2 ] / (-1 )= r ( -‚àö2/2 ) / (-1 )= r (‚àö2/2 )Similarly, C_y = r sin œÄ/4 / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r (‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Following the same steps as above, we get C_y = r (‚àö2/2 )Thus, C_x + C_y = r‚àö2/2 + r‚àö2/2 = r‚àö2, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that C_x + C_y = r.This suggests that there is a mistake in the derivation.Wait, but when I derived C_x + C_y = r, I used the fact that k = (C_x + C_y) k / r, which led to C_x + C_y = r.But when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, k = 1 + ‚àö2, and C_x + C_y = r‚àö2, which is not equal to r unless ‚àö2 = 1, which is not true.Thus, the mistake must be in the derivation.Wait, let's re-examine the step where we had:From:k = (C_x + C_y) k / rWe concluded that C_x + C_y = rBut this is only valid if k ‚â† 0, which is true, but let's see:If k = (C_x + C_y) k / r, then:k (1 - (C_x + C_y)/r ) = 0Since k ‚â† 0, we have:1 - (C_x + C_y)/r = 0 => C_x + C_y = rBut when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, C_x + C_y = r‚àö2, which contradicts.Thus, the mistake must be in the earlier steps.Wait, perhaps the error is in the assumption that C_x + C_y = r is valid for all Œ∏, but in reality, it's only valid when k ‚â† 0, which is always true except when k = 0, which is a degenerate case.But when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, k = 1 + ‚àö2, which is not zero, so C_x + C_y should equal r, but in reality, it equals r‚àö2.This suggests that the derivation is incorrect.Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the step where we expressed sin t and cos t in terms of C_x and C_y.Let me re-express:From C_x = r (cos t + 1) / kFrom C_y = r sin t / kThus,cos t + 1 = (C_x k)/rsin t = (C_y k)/rNow, since sin¬≤ t + cos¬≤ t = 1, we have:[ (C_y k / r ) ]¬≤ + [ (C_x k / r - 1 ) ]¬≤ = 1Expanding:C_y¬≤ k¬≤ / r¬≤ + (C_x¬≤ k¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x k / r + 1 ) = 1Combine terms:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x k / r + 1 = 1Subtract 1:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k¬≤ / r¬≤ - 2 C_x k / r = 0Factor out k / r:k / r [ (C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k / r - 2 C_x ] = 0Since k ‚â† 0, we have:(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k / r - 2 C_x = 0Thus,(C_y¬≤ + C_x¬≤) k = 2 C_x rBut k = sin t + cos t + 1 = (C_y k / r ) + (C_x k / r - 1 ) + 1 = (C_x + C_y ) k / rThus,k = (C_x + C_y ) k / rAssuming k ‚â† 0, we can divide both sides by k:1 = (C_x + C_y ) / rThus,C_x + C_y = rBut when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, this leads to a contradiction, so perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that C_x + C_y = r is valid for all Œ∏, but in reality, it's only valid when the incenter lies on AB, which is the line x + y = r.But when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, the incenter lies on AB, so C_x + C_y = r must hold.Wait, but when I calculated C_x and C_y for Œ∏ = œÄ/4, I got C_x = C_y = r‚àö2/2, which sums to r‚àö2, which is not equal to r.This suggests that my calculation for C_x and C_y when Œ∏ = œÄ/4 is incorrect.Wait, let's recalculate C_x and C_y for Œ∏ = œÄ/4 correctly.Given Œ∏ = œÄ/4:C_x = r (cos œÄ/4 + 1) / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r ( (‚àö2/2 + 1) ) / ( ‚àö2/2 + ‚àö2/2 + 1 )= r (1 + ‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Similarly,C_y = r sin œÄ/4 / (sin œÄ/4 + cos œÄ/4 + 1 )= r (‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Now, let's compute C_x:Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - ‚àö2 ):C_x = r (1 + ‚àö2/2 )(1 - ‚àö2 ) / (1 - 2 )= r [ (1)(1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2 )(1 - ‚àö2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2 - (‚àö2 )¬≤/2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - ‚àö2 ) + (‚àö2/2 - 1 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ (1 - 1 ) + (-‚àö2 + ‚àö2/2 ) ] / (-1 )= r [ 0 - ‚àö2/2 ] / (-1 )= r ( -‚àö2/2 ) / (-1 )= r (‚àö2/2 )Similarly, C_y:C_y = r (‚àö2/2 ) / (1 + ‚àö2 )Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - ‚àö2 ):= r (‚àö2/2 )(1 - ‚àö2 ) / (1 - 2 )= r (‚àö2/2 - (‚àö2 )¬≤/2 ) / (-1 )= r (‚àö2/2 - 1 ) / (-1 )= r (1 - ‚àö2/2 )Wait, this is different from before. So, C_y = r (1 - ‚àö2/2 )Thus, C_x + C_y = r‚àö2/2 + r (1 - ‚àö2/2 ) = r‚àö2/2 + r - r‚àö2/2 = rSo, indeed, C_x + C_y = r.Earlier, I incorrectly calculated C_y as r‚àö2/2, but it's actually r (1 - ‚àö2/2 ).Thus, the correct coordinates for Œ∏ = œÄ/4 are:C_x = r‚àö2/2C_y = r (1 - ‚àö2/2 )Which indeed sum to r.Therefore, the locus of point C is the line C_x + C_y = r, which is the line AB.Thus, the locus of the incenter C is the line segment AB.But wait, when Œ∏ varies, point C moves along AB from A to B and back.But when Œ∏ approaches 0, point P approaches A, and the tangent at P becomes vertical, intersecting AA' at T approaching infinity. In this case, the incenter C approaches the midpoint of AB, which is (r/2, r/2).Similarly, when Œ∏ approaches œÄ/2, point P approaches B, and the tangent becomes horizontal, intersecting AA' at T approaching infinity, and C again approaches the midpoint of AB.Wait, but earlier, we saw that for Œ∏ = œÄ/4, C is at (r‚àö2/2, r (1 - ‚àö2/2 )), which is not the midpoint.Wait, let's compute the midpoint of AB:A is (r,0), B is (0,r), so midpoint is (r/2, r/2).But for Œ∏ = œÄ/4, C is at (r‚àö2/2, r (1 - ‚àö2/2 )).Let me compute r‚àö2/2 ‚âà 0.707r, and r (1 - ‚àö2/2 ) ‚âà r (1 - 0.707 ) ‚âà 0.293r.So, C is at approximately (0.707r, 0.293r), which is not the midpoint.Thus, as Œ∏ varies, C moves along AB from A to B and back, but not passing through the midpoint except at specific angles.Wait, no, actually, when Œ∏ = 45¬∞, C is at (r‚àö2/2, r (1 - ‚àö2/2 )), which is not the midpoint.But when Œ∏ approaches 0, C approaches (r,0), which is point A.When Œ∏ approaches œÄ/2, C approaches (0,r), which is point B.Thus, the locus of C is the line segment AB.But wait, in the initial problem, the diameters are AA' and BB', so AB is the line from (r,0) to (0,r), which is indeed the line x + y = r.Thus, the locus of point C is the line segment AB.But wait, when Œ∏ = œÄ/2, point P is at (0,r), and the tangent is horizontal line y = r, which doesn't intersect AA' (y=0) at finite T, so T is at infinity, and the incenter C approaches (0,r), which is point B.Similarly, when Œ∏ approaches 0, P approaches (r,0), tangent is vertical line x = r, intersecting AA' at T = (r,0), which is point A, so triangle OPT becomes degenerate, and the incenter approaches A.Thus, the locus of C is the line segment AB.But wait, when Œ∏ = œÄ/4, C is at (r‚àö2/2, r (1 - ‚àö2/2 )), which is on AB.Thus, the locus of C is the line segment AB.Therefore, the answer is that the locus of C is the line segment AB."},{"question":"Circle  C  with radius  2  has diameter  overline{AB} .

The radius of circle  D  is three times the radius of circle  E  and can be written in the form  sqrt{m} - n,  where  m  and  n  are positive integers. Find  m+n .","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about three circles and a diameter. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a circle C with radius 2, and AB is its diameter. So, AB is a straight line passing through the center of circle C, right? The length of AB should be twice the radius, so 4 units.Now, circle D is internally tangent to circle C at point A. Hmm, internal tangency means that circle D lies entirely inside circle C and touches it exactly at point A. Since it's tangent at A, the center of circle D must lie along the line connecting the centers of circles C and D, which is the same as the line from the center of C to point A. Let me denote the radius of circle D as r_D. Since it's internally tangent, the distance between the centers of C and D should be equal to the radius of C minus the radius of D. So, if the center of circle C is O, then the distance from O to the center of D, let's call it O_D, is 2 - r_D.Next, there's circle E, which is also internally tangent to circle C. So, circle E is inside circle C as well. It's also externally tangent to circle D, meaning they touch each other at exactly one point, and circle E is outside of circle D. Additionally, circle E is tangent to the diameter AB. Let me denote the radius of circle E as r_E. The problem states that the radius of circle D is three times the radius of circle E, so r_D = 3r_E. That's a key relationship we can use later.Since circle E is tangent to AB, which is a straight line, the distance from the center of circle E to AB must be equal to its radius, r_E. Also, because circle E is internally tangent to circle C, the distance from the center of circle C to the center of circle E must be equal to 2 - r_E.Let me try to set up a coordinate system to model this. Let's place circle C with its center at the origin (0,0). Then, the diameter AB lies along the x-axis from (-2,0) to (2,0). Circle D is tangent to circle C at point A, which is (-2,0). So, the center of circle D must lie along the line connecting the centers of C and D, which is the line from (0,0) to (-2,0). Therefore, the center of circle D is at (- (2 - r_D), 0). Wait, hold on. If the distance from O to O_D is 2 - r_D, and since it's along the x-axis towards A, which is at (-2,0), the center of D should be at (- (2 - r_D), 0). So, if r_D is 3r_E, then the center is at (- (2 - 3r_E), 0).Now, circle E is tangent to AB, which is the x-axis. So, the y-coordinate of the center of circle E must be equal to its radius, r_E. Let me denote the center of circle E as (h, r_E). Since circle E is internally tangent to circle C, the distance between their centers must be 2 - r_E. So, the distance from (0,0) to (h, r_E) is sqrt(h^2 + (r_E)^2) = 2 - r_E. Squaring both sides, we get:h^2 + r_E^2 = (2 - r_E)^2h^2 + r_E^2 = 4 - 4r_E + r_E^2Simplifying, h^2 = 4 - 4r_ESo, h = sqrt(4 - 4r_E) or h = -sqrt(4 - 4r_E). But since circle E is tangent to AB and also externally tangent to circle D, which is on the left side, circle E must be on the right side of circle D. So, h should be positive. Therefore, h = sqrt(4 - 4r_E).Wait, but let me think again. If circle E is tangent to AB, which is the x-axis, and also externally tangent to circle D, which is on the left side, circle E could be on either side. But since circle E is inside circle C, and circle D is already on the left, circle E is probably on the right side. So, h is positive.Now, circle E is externally tangent to circle D. So, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii, which is r_D + r_E = 3r_E + r_E = 4r_E.The center of circle D is at (- (2 - 3r_E), 0), and the center of circle E is at (sqrt(4 - 4r_E), r_E). So, the distance between these two centers is sqrt[ (sqrt(4 - 4r_E) + (2 - 3r_E))^2 + (r_E - 0)^2 ].Wait, let me write that more clearly. The x-coordinate of circle D's center is - (2 - 3r_E), and the x-coordinate of circle E's center is sqrt(4 - 4r_E). So, the difference in x-coordinates is sqrt(4 - 4r_E) - ( - (2 - 3r_E)) = sqrt(4 - 4r_E) + 2 - 3r_E.The y-coordinate difference is r_E - 0 = r_E.So, the distance between centers is sqrt[ (sqrt(4 - 4r_E) + 2 - 3r_E)^2 + (r_E)^2 ].This distance should equal 4r_E.So, we have:sqrt[ (sqrt(4 - 4r_E) + 2 - 3r_E)^2 + (r_E)^2 ] = 4r_ELet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:( sqrt(4 - 4r_E) + 2 - 3r_E )^2 + (r_E)^2 = (4r_E)^2Expanding the left side:First, let me denote sqrt(4 - 4r_E) as S for simplicity.So, (S + 2 - 3r_E)^2 + r_E^2 = 16r_E^2Expanding (S + 2 - 3r_E)^2:= S^2 + 2*S*(2 - 3r_E) + (2 - 3r_E)^2So, substituting back S = sqrt(4 - 4r_E):= (4 - 4r_E) + 2*sqrt(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E) + (4 - 12r_E + 9r_E^2) + r_E^2 = 16r_E^2Simplify:4 - 4r_E + 2*sqrt(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E) + 4 - 12r_E + 9r_E^2 + r_E^2 = 16r_E^2Combine like terms:4 + 4 = 8-4r_E -12r_E = -16r_E9r_E^2 + r_E^2 = 10r_E^2So, the equation becomes:8 - 16r_E + 10r_E^2 + 2*sqrt(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E) = 16r_E^2Bring all terms to one side:8 - 16r_E + 10r_E^2 + 2*sqrt(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E) - 16r_E^2 = 0Simplify:8 - 16r_E - 6r_E^2 + 2*sqrt(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E) = 0Let me rearrange:2*sqrt(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E) = 6r_E^2 + 16r_E - 8Divide both sides by 2:sqrt(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E) = 3r_E^2 + 8r_E - 4Now, let me square both sides again to eliminate the square root:[ sqrt(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E) ]^2 = (3r_E^2 + 8r_E - 4)^2Left side:(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E)^2Right side:(3r_E^2 + 8r_E - 4)^2Let me compute both sides.First, left side:(4 - 4r_E)*(2 - 3r_E)^2First compute (2 - 3r_E)^2:= 4 - 12r_E + 9r_E^2Multiply by (4 - 4r_E):= (4 - 4r_E)*(4 - 12r_E + 9r_E^2)= 4*(4 - 12r_E + 9r_E^2) - 4r_E*(4 - 12r_E + 9r_E^2)= 16 - 48r_E + 36r_E^2 - 16r_E + 48r_E^2 - 36r_E^3= 16 - 64r_E + 84r_E^2 - 36r_E^3Right side:(3r_E^2 + 8r_E - 4)^2Expand this:= (3r_E^2)^2 + (8r_E)^2 + (-4)^2 + 2*(3r_E^2)*(8r_E) + 2*(3r_E^2)*(-4) + 2*(8r_E)*(-4)= 9r_E^4 + 64r_E^2 + 16 + 48r_E^3 - 24r_E^2 - 64r_E= 9r_E^4 + 48r_E^3 + (64r_E^2 - 24r_E^2) + (-64r_E) + 16= 9r_E^4 + 48r_E^3 + 40r_E^2 - 64r_E + 16So, now we have:Left side: 16 - 64r_E + 84r_E^2 - 36r_E^3Right side: 9r_E^4 + 48r_E^3 + 40r_E^2 - 64r_E + 16Bring all terms to one side:16 - 64r_E + 84r_E^2 - 36r_E^3 - 9r_E^4 - 48r_E^3 - 40r_E^2 + 64r_E - 16 = 0Simplify term by term:16 - 16 = 0-64r_E + 64r_E = 084r_E^2 - 40r_E^2 = 44r_E^2-36r_E^3 - 48r_E^3 = -84r_E^3-9r_E^4So, the equation becomes:-9r_E^4 -84r_E^3 + 44r_E^2 = 0Multiply both sides by -1:9r_E^4 + 84r_E^3 - 44r_E^2 = 0Factor out r_E^2:r_E^2*(9r_E^2 + 84r_E - 44) = 0So, either r_E^2 = 0, which would mean r_E = 0, which isn't possible for a circle, or:9r_E^2 + 84r_E - 44 = 0Now, solve this quadratic equation for r_E.Using the quadratic formula:r_E = [ -84 ¬± sqrt(84^2 - 4*9*(-44)) ] / (2*9)Compute discriminant:84^2 = 70564*9*44 = 36*44 = 1584So, discriminant = 7056 + 1584 = 8640So,r_E = [ -84 ¬± sqrt(8640) ] / 18Simplify sqrt(8640):8640 = 16 * 540 = 16 * 9 * 60 = 16 * 9 * 4 * 15 = 16*4*9*15 = 64*9*15So, sqrt(8640) = 8*3*sqrt(15) = 24sqrt(15)Wait, let me check:Wait, 8640 divided by 16 is 540.540 divided by 9 is 60.60 is 4*15.So, sqrt(8640) = sqrt(16 * 9 * 4 * 15) = 4*3*2*sqrt(15) = 24sqrt(15). Yes, that's correct.So,r_E = [ -84 ¬± 24sqrt(15) ] / 18Simplify numerator and denominator:Divide numerator and denominator by 6:r_E = [ -14 ¬± 4sqrt(15) ] / 3Since radius can't be negative, we take the positive solution:r_E = [ -14 + 4sqrt(15) ] / 3Wait, but that would be negative because 4sqrt(15) is approximately 4*3.872 = 15.488, so 15.488 -14 = 1.488, which is positive. So,r_E = (4sqrt(15) -14)/3Therefore, the radius of circle D is 3r_E = 3*(4sqrt(15) -14)/3 = 4sqrt(15) -14So, r_D = 4sqrt(15) -14But the problem states that r_D can be written as sqrt(m) - n, where m and n are positive integers. So, 4sqrt(15) is sqrt(16*15) = sqrt(240). Therefore, r_D = sqrt(240) -14.Thus, m = 240 and n =14, so m + n = 240 +14 =254.**Final Answer**boxed{254}"},{"question":"The ratio of the father's age to his son's age is unknown.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with trigonometric functions and angles, sometimes it's helpful to use angle addition or subtraction formulas. In this case, since I have cos(Œ± - œÄ/4), maybe I can use the cosine of a difference formula.The formula for cos(A - B) is cos A cos B + sin A sin B. So, if I let A be Œ± and B be œÄ/4, then cos(Œ± - œÄ/4) should be equal to cos Œ± cos œÄ/4 + sin Œ± sin œÄ/4. That seems right. I think cos œÄ/4 and sin œÄ/4 are both ‚àö2/2, so that might simplify things.But wait, I don't know the values of cos Œ± and sin Œ± yet. I only know that tan Œ± is 2. Hmm, okay, so maybe I can find cos Œ± and sin Œ± from tan Œ±. I remember that tan Œ± is equal to sin Œ± over cos Œ±, so tan Œ± = 2 implies that sin Œ± / cos Œ± = 2. That means sin Œ± = 2 cos Œ±.Also, I remember the Pythagorean identity: sin¬≤ Œ± + cos¬≤ Œ± = 1. Since I know that sin Œ± is 2 cos Œ±, I can substitute that into the identity. So, (2 cos Œ±)¬≤ + cos¬≤ Œ± = 1. Let's compute that: 4 cos¬≤ Œ± + cos¬≤ Œ± = 1, which simplifies to 5 cos¬≤ Œ± = 1. Therefore, cos¬≤ Œ± = 1/5, so cos Œ± is the square root of 1/5. Since Œ± is between 0 and œÄ/2, cosine is positive, so cos Œ± = ‚àö(1/5) = 1/‚àö5.Now, since sin Œ± = 2 cos Œ±, that means sin Œ± = 2*(1/‚àö5) = 2/‚àö5. Okay, so now I have both sin Œ± and cos Œ±. Let me write them down:sin Œ± = 2/‚àö5cos Œ± = 1/‚àö5Great, now I can plug these into the cosine of a difference formula. So, cos(Œ± - œÄ/4) = cos Œ± cos œÄ/4 + sin Œ± sin œÄ/4. As I thought earlier, cos œÄ/4 and sin œÄ/4 are both ‚àö2/2, so let's substitute those in.So, cos(Œ± - œÄ/4) = (1/‚àö5)*(‚àö2/2) + (2/‚àö5)*(‚àö2/2). Let me compute each term separately.First term: (1/‚àö5)*(‚àö2/2) = (‚àö2)/(2‚àö5)Second term: (2/‚àö5)*(‚àö2/2) = (2‚àö2)/(2‚àö5) = ‚àö2/‚àö5Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the second term. So, (2/‚àö5)*(‚àö2/2) simplifies as follows: the 2 in the numerator and the 2 in the denominator cancel out, leaving ‚àö2/‚àö5. Okay, that makes sense.So now, adding the two terms together: (‚àö2)/(2‚àö5) + ‚àö2/‚àö5. To add these, they need a common denominator. The first term has a denominator of 2‚àö5, and the second term has a denominator of ‚àö5, which is equivalent to 2‚àö5/2. So, let me write the second term as (2‚àö2)/(2‚àö5) to have the same denominator as the first term.So, now we have (‚àö2)/(2‚àö5) + (2‚àö2)/(2‚àö5) = (‚àö2 + 2‚àö2)/(2‚àö5) = (3‚àö2)/(2‚àö5).Hmm, that's 3‚àö2 over 2‚àö5. Maybe I can rationalize the denominator here. To rationalize, I can multiply numerator and denominator by ‚àö5.So, (3‚àö2 * ‚àö5)/(2‚àö5 * ‚àö5) = (3‚àö10)/(2*5) = (3‚àö10)/10.Okay, so cos(Œ± - œÄ/4) simplifies to 3‚àö10/10. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Given tan Œ± = 2, so sin Œ± = 2 cos Œ±.2. Using the Pythagorean identity, sin¬≤ Œ± + cos¬≤ Œ± = 1, substituted sin Œ± = 2 cos Œ±, leading to 5 cos¬≤ Œ± = 1, so cos Œ± = 1/‚àö5 and sin Œ± = 2/‚àö5.3. Applied the cosine of a difference formula: cos(Œ± - œÄ/4) = cos Œ± cos œÄ/4 + sin Œ± sin œÄ/4.4. Substituted the known values of cos Œ± and sin Œ±, along with cos œÄ/4 and sin œÄ/4 both equal to ‚àö2/2.5. Simplified each term, combined them, and rationalized the denominator to get the final result of 3‚àö10/10.I think that all checks out. I don't see any errors in the calculations or the logic. So, the value of cos(Œ± - œÄ/4) is 3‚àö10 divided by 10.**Final Answer**The value of (cos left(alpha - frac{pi}{4}right)) is boxed{dfrac{3sqrt{10}}{10}}."},{"question":"A car starts with a full 12-gallon gasoline tank and travels for 3 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour with a consumption rate of 1 gallon every 40 miles.

What is the fraction of a full tank that the car has used after the entire journey?","answer":"First, calculate the gasoline used during the first part of the journey. The car travels at 50 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering 150 miles. With a consumption rate of 1 gallon every 40 miles, the gasoline used is 150 divided by 40, which equals 3.75 gallons.After refilling 5 gallons, the gasoline in the tank becomes 12 minus 3.75 plus 5, totaling 13.25 gallons.Next, calculate the gasoline used during the second part of the journey.

Let P and Q be two points on the ellipse located in the first quadrant, such that OQ parallel AP. Let M be the midpoint of the segment AP, and the ray OM intersects the ellipse at point R. Prove that the segments OQ, OR, and BC can form a right triangle.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an ellipse in the coordinate plane. The ellipse is given by the equation ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ) where ( a > b > 0 ). The vertices are labeled as A, B, C, and D, which are the left, right, top, and bottom vertices respectively. So, A is (-a, 0), B is (a, 0), C is (0, b), and D is (0, -b).Now, there are two points P and Q on the ellipse located in the first quadrant. The condition given is that the line segment OQ is parallel to AP. O is the origin, right? So, OQ is the line from the origin to Q, and AP is the line from A to P. Since they are parallel, their slopes must be equal.Let me denote point P as (x1, y1) and point Q as (x2, y2). Both points are on the ellipse, so they satisfy the ellipse equation. So, ( frac{x1^2}{a^2} + frac{y1^2}{b^2} = 1 ) and ( frac{x2^2}{a^2} + frac{y2^2}{b^2} = 1 ).Since OQ is parallel to AP, their slopes must be equal. The slope of OQ is ( frac{y2}{x2} ) because it goes from (0,0) to (x2, y2). The slope of AP is ( frac{y1 - 0}{x1 - (-a)} = frac{y1}{x1 + a} ). So, setting them equal:( frac{y2}{x2} = frac{y1}{x1 + a} ).That's one equation relating the coordinates of P and Q.Next, M is the midpoint of segment AP. So, the coordinates of M would be the average of the coordinates of A and P. A is (-a, 0) and P is (x1, y1), so M is:( M = left( frac{-a + x1}{2}, frac{0 + y1}{2} right) = left( frac{x1 - a}{2}, frac{y1}{2} right) ).Then, the ray OM intersects the ellipse at point R. So, starting from the origin, going through M, and intersecting the ellipse again at R. So, R is another point on the ellipse along the line OM.I need to find the coordinates of R. Since OM is a line from the origin through M, its parametric equations can be written as ( x = t cdot frac{x1 - a}{2} ) and ( y = t cdot frac{y1}{2} ) where t is a parameter. When t=1, we reach M, but we need to find t such that the point is on the ellipse.So, substituting into the ellipse equation:( frac{(t cdot frac{x1 - a}{2})^2}{a^2} + frac{(t cdot frac{y1}{2})^2}{b^2} = 1 ).Simplify:( frac{t^2 (x1 - a)^2}{4a^2} + frac{t^2 y1^2}{4b^2} = 1 ).Factor out ( frac{t^2}{4} ):( frac{t^2}{4} left( frac{(x1 - a)^2}{a^2} + frac{y1^2}{b^2} right) = 1 ).Let me compute the term inside the parentheses:( frac{(x1 - a)^2}{a^2} + frac{y1^2}{b^2} ).Since P is on the ellipse, ( frac{x1^2}{a^2} + frac{y1^2}{b^2} = 1 ). Let me expand ( (x1 - a)^2 ):( x1^2 - 2a x1 + a^2 ).So, ( frac{(x1 - a)^2}{a^2} = frac{x1^2 - 2a x1 + a^2}{a^2} = frac{x1^2}{a^2} - 2 frac{x1}{a} + 1 ).Therefore, the term inside the parentheses becomes:( frac{x1^2}{a^2} - 2 frac{x1}{a} + 1 + frac{y1^2}{b^2} ).But ( frac{x1^2}{a^2} + frac{y1^2}{b^2} = 1 ), so substituting:( 1 - 2 frac{x1}{a} + 1 = 2 - 2 frac{x1}{a} = 2 left(1 - frac{x1}{a}right) ).So, going back to the equation:( frac{t^2}{4} cdot 2 left(1 - frac{x1}{a}right) = 1 ).Simplify:( frac{t^2}{2} left(1 - frac{x1}{a}right) = 1 ).Solving for t^2:( t^2 = frac{2}{1 - frac{x1}{a}} = frac{2a}{a - x1} ).So, t is ( sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} ). But since we are moving from the origin through M to R, t must be greater than 1 because M is between O and R. So, t = ( sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} ).Therefore, the coordinates of R are:( x = t cdot frac{x1 - a}{2} = sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} cdot frac{x1 - a}{2} ).Simplify:( x = frac{(x1 - a)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} ).Note that ( x1 - a = -(a - x1) ), so:( x = - frac{(a - x1)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} = - frac{sqrt{(a - x1)^2}}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} ).Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, since R is on the ellipse and on the line OM, which passes through M. Maybe parametrize the line OM differently.Let me denote the parametric equations of OM as:( x = k cdot frac{x1 - a}{2} )( y = k cdot frac{y1}{2} )We need to find k such that (x, y) is on the ellipse.So, substituting into ellipse equation:( frac{(k cdot frac{x1 - a}{2})^2}{a^2} + frac{(k cdot frac{y1}{2})^2}{b^2} = 1 ).Which is similar to before:( frac{k^2 (x1 - a)^2}{4a^2} + frac{k^2 y1^2}{4b^2} = 1 ).Factor out ( frac{k^2}{4} ):( frac{k^2}{4} left( frac{(x1 - a)^2}{a^2} + frac{y1^2}{b^2} right) = 1 ).As before, the term inside the parentheses is 2(1 - x1/a). So,( frac{k^2}{4} cdot 2(1 - x1/a) = 1 )Simplify:( frac{k^2}{2} (1 - x1/a) = 1 )Thus,( k^2 = frac{2}{1 - x1/a} = frac{2a}{a - x1} )So, ( k = sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} ). Since k must be positive (as we are moving from O through M to R), so k is positive.Therefore, coordinates of R are:( x = sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} cdot frac{x1 - a}{2} )( y = sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} cdot frac{y1}{2} )Simplify x-coordinate:( x = frac{(x1 - a)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} = frac{ - (a - x1) }{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} )Let me factor out the negative sign:( x = - frac{(a - x1)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} )Simplify the expression inside the square root:( sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} = sqrt{frac{2a}{(a - x1)}} )So, ( (a - x1) ) cancels with the denominator inside the square root:( x = - frac{sqrt{(a - x1)^2}}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{(a - x1)}} )Wait, ( sqrt{(a - x1)^2} = |a - x1| ). Since P is in the first quadrant, x1 is positive, but since a > x1 (because P is on the ellipse and a is the semi-major axis), so a - x1 is positive. So, |a - x1| = a - x1.Thus,( x = - frac{(a - x1)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{(a - x1)}} )Simplify:( x = - frac{(a - x1)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{(a - x1)}} = - frac{sqrt{(a - x1)^2}}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{(a - x1)}} )Wait, maybe another approach. Let me write it as:( x = - frac{(a - x1)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{(a - x1)}} = - frac{sqrt{(a - x1)^2}}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{(a - x1)}} )But ( sqrt{(a - x1)^2} = a - x1 ), so:( x = - frac{(a - x1)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2a}{(a - x1)}} = - frac{sqrt{(a - x1)^2 cdot frac{2a}{(a - x1)}}}{2} )Simplify inside the square root:( (a - x1)^2 cdot frac{2a}{(a - x1)} = (a - x1) cdot 2a )So,( x = - frac{sqrt{2a(a - x1)}}{2} )Similarly, the y-coordinate:( y = sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} cdot frac{y1}{2} )But from the ellipse equation, ( frac{x1^2}{a^2} + frac{y1^2}{b^2} = 1 ), so ( y1 = b sqrt{1 - frac{x1^2}{a^2}} ).So,( y = sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} cdot frac{b sqrt{1 - frac{x1^2}{a^2}}}{2} )Simplify:( y = frac{b}{2} sqrt{frac{2a}{a - x1}} cdot sqrt{1 - frac{x1^2}{a^2}} )Combine the square roots:( y = frac{b}{2} sqrt{ frac{2a}{a - x1} cdot left(1 - frac{x1^2}{a^2}right) } )Simplify the expression inside:( frac{2a}{a - x1} cdot left(1 - frac{x1^2}{a^2}right) = frac{2a}{a - x1} cdot frac{a^2 - x1^2}{a^2} = frac{2a(a^2 - x1^2)}{a^2(a - x1)} )Factor ( a^2 - x1^2 = (a - x1)(a + x1) ):( frac{2a(a - x1)(a + x1)}{a^2(a - x1)} = frac{2a(a + x1)}{a^2} = frac{2(a + x1)}{a} )So, back to y:( y = frac{b}{2} sqrt{ frac{2(a + x1)}{a} } = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{ frac{2(a + x1)}{a} } )Simplify:( y = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{ frac{2(a + x1)}{a} } = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{ frac{2}{a} (a + x1) } )So, R has coordinates:( x = - frac{sqrt{2a(a - x1)}}{2} )( y = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{ frac{2}{a} (a + x1) } )Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.Wait, perhaps using parametric coordinates for the ellipse. Let me parameterize P and Q.Let me denote point P as ( (a cos theta, b sin theta) ). Since P is in the first quadrant, Œ∏ is between 0 and œÄ/2.Similarly, point Q is also in the first quadrant, so let me denote Q as ( (a cos phi, b sin phi) ).Given that OQ is parallel to AP. So, the slope of OQ is ( frac{b sin phi}{a cos phi} = frac{b}{a} tan phi ).The slope of AP is ( frac{b sin theta - 0}{a cos theta - (-a)} = frac{b sin theta}{a (cos theta + 1)} ).Since they are parallel, their slopes are equal:( frac{b}{a} tan phi = frac{b sin theta}{a (cos theta + 1)} )Simplify:( tan phi = frac{sin theta}{cos theta + 1} )Recall that ( tan phi = frac{sin phi}{cos phi} ). So,( frac{sin phi}{cos phi} = frac{sin theta}{cos theta + 1} )Cross-multiplying:( sin phi (cos theta + 1) = sin theta cos phi )Let me rearrange:( sin phi cos theta + sin phi = sin theta cos phi )Bring all terms to one side:( sin phi cos theta - sin theta cos phi + sin phi = 0 )Notice that ( sin phi cos theta - sin theta cos phi = sin(phi - theta) ). So,( sin(phi - theta) + sin phi = 0 )Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another identity.Alternatively, let me express everything in terms of tan(œÜ/2) and tan(Œ∏/2). Using the identities:( sin phi = frac{2 tan(phi/2)}{1 + tan^2(phi/2)} )( cos phi = frac{1 - tan^2(phi/2)}{1 + tan^2(phi/2)} )Similarly for Œ∏.But this might complicate things further. Maybe instead, express in terms of tan(œÜ) and tan(theta).Wait, from earlier, we have:( tan phi = frac{sin theta}{cos theta + 1} )Let me write this as:( tan phi = frac{sin theta}{1 + cos theta} )Recall that ( frac{sin theta}{1 + cos theta} = tan(theta/2) ). So,( tan phi = tan(theta/2) )Therefore, ( phi = theta/2 + kpi ). But since both œÜ and Œ∏ are between 0 and œÄ/2, we can take ( phi = theta/2 ).So, œÜ = Œ∏/2.Therefore, point Q is ( (a cos(theta/2), b sin(theta/2)) ).That's a useful relationship. So, Q is determined by Œ∏/2.Now, let's find point R, which is the intersection of ray OM with the ellipse, where M is the midpoint of AP.Point A is (-a, 0), point P is (a cos Œ∏, b sin Œ∏). So, midpoint M is:( M = left( frac{-a + a cos theta}{2}, frac{0 + b sin theta}{2} right) = left( frac{a (cos theta - 1)}{2}, frac{b sin theta}{2} right) )So, the coordinates of M are ( left( frac{a (cos theta - 1)}{2}, frac{b sin theta}{2} right) ).The ray OM goes from the origin (0,0) through M. So, parametric equations for OM are:( x = t cdot frac{a (cos theta - 1)}{2} )( y = t cdot frac{b sin theta}{2} )We need to find t such that this point lies on the ellipse. So, substitute into the ellipse equation:( frac{(t cdot frac{a (cos theta - 1)}{2})^2}{a^2} + frac{(t cdot frac{b sin theta}{2})^2}{b^2} = 1 )Simplify:( frac{t^2 a^2 (cos theta - 1)^2}{4a^2} + frac{t^2 b^2 sin^2 theta}{4b^2} = 1 )Simplify further:( frac{t^2 (cos theta - 1)^2}{4} + frac{t^2 sin^2 theta}{4} = 1 )Factor out ( frac{t^2}{4} ):( frac{t^2}{4} [ (cos theta - 1)^2 + sin^2 theta ] = 1 )Compute the expression inside the brackets:( (cos theta - 1)^2 + sin^2 theta = cos^2 theta - 2 cos theta + 1 + sin^2 theta )Simplify:( (cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta) - 2 cos theta + 1 = 1 - 2 cos theta + 1 = 2(1 - cos theta) )So, we have:( frac{t^2}{4} cdot 2(1 - cos theta) = 1 )Simplify:( frac{t^2}{2} (1 - cos theta) = 1 )Thus,( t^2 = frac{2}{1 - cos theta} )So,( t = sqrt{frac{2}{1 - cos theta}} )Since t must be positive, we take the positive root.Therefore, the coordinates of R are:( x = sqrt{frac{2}{1 - cos theta}} cdot frac{a (cos theta - 1)}{2} )( y = sqrt{frac{2}{1 - cos theta}} cdot frac{b sin theta}{2} )Simplify x-coordinate:( x = frac{a (cos theta - 1)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2}{1 - cos theta}} )Note that ( cos theta - 1 = - (1 - cos theta) ), so:( x = - frac{a (1 - cos theta)}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2}{1 - cos theta}} )Simplify:( x = - frac{a}{2} cdot sqrt{(1 - cos theta)^2 cdot frac{2}{1 - cos theta}} )Which is:( x = - frac{a}{2} cdot sqrt{2(1 - cos theta)} )Similarly, y-coordinate:( y = frac{b sin theta}{2} cdot sqrt{frac{2}{1 - cos theta}} )Simplify:( y = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{ frac{2 sin^2 theta}{1 - cos theta} } )Note that ( 1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2 (theta/2) ), and ( sin theta = 2 sin (theta/2) cos (theta/2) ).So,( y = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{ frac{2 cdot 4 sin^2 (theta/2) cos^2 (theta/2)}{2 sin^2 (theta/2)} } = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{ frac{8 sin^2 (theta/2) cos^2 (theta/2)}{2 sin^2 (theta/2)} } )Wait, perhaps a better approach.Express ( frac{sin^2 theta}{1 - cos theta} ):( frac{sin^2 theta}{1 - cos theta} = frac{(1 - cos^2 theta)}{1 - cos theta} = 1 + cos theta )So,( y = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{2(1 + cos theta)} )Therefore, R has coordinates:( x = - frac{a}{2} cdot sqrt{2(1 - cos theta)} )( y = frac{b}{2} cdot sqrt{2(1 + cos theta)} )Simplify:( x = - frac{a}{sqrt{2}} cdot sqrt{1 - cos theta} )( y = frac{b}{sqrt{2}} cdot sqrt{1 + cos theta} )Alternatively, using the identities:( sqrt{1 - cos theta} = sqrt{2} sin (theta/2) )( sqrt{1 + cos theta} = sqrt{2} cos (theta/2) )So,( x = - frac{a}{sqrt{2}} cdot sqrt{2} sin (theta/2) = -a sin (theta/2) )( y = frac{b}{sqrt{2}} cdot sqrt{2} cos (theta/2) = b cos (theta/2) )Therefore, R is ( (-a sin (theta/2), b cos (theta/2)) ).That's a much cleaner expression!So, to recap:- Point P is ( (a cos theta, b sin theta) )- Point Q is ( (a cos (theta/2), b sin (theta/2)) )- Point R is ( (-a sin (theta/2), b cos (theta/2)) )Now, we need to show that segments OQ, OR, and BC can form a right triangle.First, let's find the lengths of OQ, OR, and BC.Length of OQ:( |OQ| = sqrt{(a cos (theta/2))^2 + (b sin (theta/2))^2} )Length of OR:( |OR| = sqrt{(-a sin (theta/2))^2 + (b cos (theta/2))^2} = sqrt{a^2 sin^2 (theta/2) + b^2 cos^2 (theta/2)} )Length of BC:Points B and C are (a, 0) and (0, b). So, BC is the line segment from (a, 0) to (0, b). The length of BC is:( |BC| = sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} )Now, we need to check if these three lengths can form a right triangle. That is, check if ( |OQ|^2 + |OR|^2 = |BC|^2 ) or some permutation.Compute ( |OQ|^2 ):( (a cos (theta/2))^2 + (b sin (theta/2))^2 = a^2 cos^2 (theta/2) + b^2 sin^2 (theta/2) )Compute ( |OR|^2 ):( a^2 sin^2 (theta/2) + b^2 cos^2 (theta/2) )Add them together:( |OQ|^2 + |OR|^2 = a^2 (cos^2 (theta/2) + sin^2 (theta/2)) + b^2 (sin^2 (theta/2) + cos^2 (theta/2)) )Simplify:( a^2 (1) + b^2 (1) = a^2 + b^2 )Which is exactly ( |BC|^2 ).Therefore, ( |OQ|^2 + |OR|^2 = |BC|^2 ), which means that the segments OQ, OR, and BC can form a right triangle with the right angle at the vertex opposite BC.Hence, the proof is complete."},{"question":"The average weight of 8 persons increases by 4.2 kg when a new person comes in place of one of them weighing 65 kg.

To find the total weight increase for the group, I multiply the average increase by the number of people: 4.2 kg/person * 8 persons = 33.6 kg.This total weight increase is due to the replacement.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I remember that to determine if two lines are parallel or perpendicular, I need to look at their slopes. If two lines have the same slope, they're parallel. If the product of their slopes is -1, then they're perpendicular. So, my first task is to find the slope of each line.Looking at the lines given:1. ( y = 2x + 7 )2. ( 2y = 6x + 8 )3. ( 3y = 18x + 6 )4. ( 2y = 5x + 11 )5. ( 4y = 8x + 12 )6. ( y = -x + 3 )I notice that some of these equations aren't in the slope-intercept form ( y = mx + b ), where ( m ) is the slope. So, I need to rearrange them to find the slope for each.Starting with the first line: ( y = 2x + 7 ). That's already in slope-intercept form, so the slope ( m_1 ) is 2.Next, the second line: ( 2y = 6x + 8 ). I need to solve for y. Dividing both sides by 2 gives ( y = 3x + 4 ). So, the slope ( m_2 ) is 3.Third line: ( 3y = 18x + 6 ). Again, solving for y. Divide both sides by 3: ( y = 6x + 2 ). So, the slope ( m_3 ) is 6.Fourth line: ( 2y = 5x + 11 ). Solving for y: divide both sides by 2, which gives ( y = frac{5}{2}x + frac{11}{2} ). So, the slope ( m_4 ) is ( frac{5}{2} ).Fifth line: ( 4y = 8x + 12 ). Solving for y: divide both sides by 4, resulting in ( y = 2x + 3 ). So, the slope ( m_5 ) is 2.Last line: ( y = -x + 3 ). This is already in slope-intercept form, so the slope ( m_6 ) is -1.Alright, so now I have all the slopes:1. ( m_1 = 2 )2. ( m_2 = 3 )3. ( m_3 = 6 )4. ( m_4 = frac{5}{2} )5. ( m_5 = 2 )6. ( m_6 = -1 )Now, I need to check for pairs of lines that are either parallel or perpendicular.Starting with parallel lines: these are lines with the same slope. Let's see which slopes are equal.Looking at the slopes:- ( m_1 = 2 ) and ( m_5 = 2 ). So, lines 1 and 5 are parallel.Are there any other pairs with the same slope? Let's check:- ( m_2 = 3 ): No other slope is 3.- ( m_3 = 6 ): No other slope is 6.- ( m_4 = frac{5}{2} ): No other slope is ( frac{5}{2} ).- ( m_6 = -1 ): No other slope is -1.So, only lines 1 and 5 are parallel.Now, moving on to perpendicular lines. For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, I need to check each pair of lines to see if their slopes multiply to -1.Let me list all possible pairs and calculate the product of their slopes:1. Line 1 (( m_1 = 2 )) and Line 2 (( m_2 = 3 )): ( 2 times 3 = 6 ) ‚Üí Not -1.2. Line 1 and Line 3: ( 2 times 6 = 12 ) ‚Üí Not -1.3. Line 1 and Line 4: ( 2 times frac{5}{2} = 5 ) ‚Üí Not -1.4. Line 1 and Line 5: ( 2 times 2 = 4 ) ‚Üí Not -1.5. Line 1 and Line 6: ( 2 times (-1) = -2 ) ‚Üí Not -1.6. Line 2 and Line 3: ( 3 times 6 = 18 ) ‚Üí Not -1.7. Line 2 and Line 4: ( 3 times frac{5}{2} = frac{15}{2} ) ‚Üí Not -1.8. Line 2 and Line 5: ( 3 times 2 = 6 ) ‚Üí Not -1.9. Line 2 and Line 6: ( 3 times (-1) = -3 ) ‚Üí Not -1.10. Line 3 and Line 4: ( 6 times frac{5}{2} = 15 ) ‚Üí Not -1.11. Line 3 and Line 5: ( 6 times 2 = 12 ) ‚Üí Not -1.12. Line 3 and Line 6: ( 6 times (-1) = -6 ) ‚Üí Not -1.13. Line 4 and Line 5: ( frac{5}{2} times 2 = 5 ) ‚Üí Not -1.14. Line 4 and Line 6: ( frac{5}{2} times (-1) = -frac{5}{2} ) ‚Üí Not -1.15. Line 5 and Line 6: ( 2 times (-1) = -2 ) ‚Üí Not -1.Hmm, none of these pairs seem to multiply to -1. Wait, did I miss something? Let me double-check.Wait, line 2 has a slope of 3, and line 6 has a slope of -1. Let me check that again: ( 3 times (-1) = -3 ), which is not -1. So, they aren't perpendicular.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the slopes? Let me go back and verify each slope.1. ( y = 2x + 7 ): Correct, slope is 2.2. ( 2y = 6x + 8 ): Divided by 2, ( y = 3x + 4 ): Correct, slope is 3.3. ( 3y = 18x + 6 ): Divided by 3, ( y = 6x + 2 ): Correct, slope is 6.4. ( 2y = 5x + 11 ): Divided by 2, ( y = frac{5}{2}x + frac{11}{2} ): Correct, slope is ( frac{5}{2} ).5. ( 4y = 8x + 12 ): Divided by 4, ( y = 2x + 3 ): Correct, slope is 2.6. ( y = -x + 3 ): Correct, slope is -1.Okay, slopes are correct. So, perhaps there are no perpendicular pairs? But that seems odd because usually, in such problems, there is at least one pair.Wait, maybe I missed a pair. Let me check all pairs again.Wait, line 2 has slope 3, and line 6 has slope -1. 3 times -1 is -3, which is not -1. So, not perpendicular.Line 4 has slope ( frac{5}{2} ). If I take the negative reciprocal, it would be ( -frac{2}{5} ). Is there any line with slope ( -frac{2}{5} )? Looking at the slopes: 2, 3, 6, ( frac{5}{2} ), 2, -1. No, there isn't.Similarly, line 3 has slope 6. The negative reciprocal would be ( -frac{1}{6} ). No line has that slope.Line 1 and 5 have slope 2. The negative reciprocal would be ( -frac{1}{2} ). No line has that slope.Line 6 has slope -1. The negative reciprocal would be 1. No line has slope 1.So, it seems like there are no pairs of lines that are perpendicular to each other.Wait, but the original problem says \\"either parallel or perpendicular.\\" So, if there are no perpendicular pairs, then only the parallel pair counts.But in the initial calculation, I thought lines 2 and 6 might be perpendicular, but their slopes multiply to -3, not -1. So, that's not perpendicular.Therefore, only one pair is parallel (lines 1 and 5), and no pairs are perpendicular.But wait, the assistant's initial answer said 2 pairs: one parallel and one perpendicular. But according to my calculations, only one pair is parallel, and none are perpendicular.Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.Wait, line 2: ( 2y = 6x + 8 ) simplifies to ( y = 3x + 4 ), slope 3.Line 6: ( y = -x + 3 ), slope -1.3 * (-1) = -3, which is not -1. So, not perpendicular.Is there any other pair?Line 4: ( frac{5}{2} ). If I take line 6: -1. ( frac{5}{2} * (-1) = -frac{5}{2} ), not -1.Line 3: 6. Line 6: -1. 6 * (-1) = -6, not -1.Line 1: 2. Line 6: -1. 2 * (-1) = -2, not -1.Line 5: 2. Line 6: -1. Same as above.So, no perpendicular pairs.Therefore, only one pair is parallel.But the assistant's answer was 2 pairs: one parallel and one perpendicular. So, maybe the assistant made a mistake.Wait, perhaps I misread the lines. Let me check the lines again.Wait, line 3: ( 3y = 18x + 6 ). Divided by 3, ( y = 6x + 2 ). Slope 6.Line 5: ( 4y = 8x + 12 ). Divided by 4, ( y = 2x + 3 ). Slope 2.So, line 3 has slope 6, line 5 has slope 2. Not the same.Wait, line 1 and line 5 both have slope 2, so they are parallel.Line 2 has slope 3, line 6 has slope -1. Not perpendicular.Line 4 has slope ( frac{5}{2} ). Is there any line with slope ( -frac{2}{5} )? No.So, no perpendicular pairs.Therefore, only one pair is parallel.But the assistant's answer was 2 pairs: one parallel and one perpendicular. So, maybe the assistant was wrong.Alternatively, perhaps I misread the lines.Wait, let me check line 3 again: ( 3y = 18x + 6 ). Divided by 3, ( y = 6x + 2 ). Correct.Line 5: ( 4y = 8x + 12 ). Divided by 4, ( y = 2x + 3 ). Correct.So, line 3 is steeper than line 5.Wait, maybe I should consider if any lines are vertical or horizontal, but none of these lines are vertical or horizontal, as all have defined slopes.So, in conclusion, only one pair is parallel, and no pairs are perpendicular. Therefore, total pairs are 1.But the assistant's answer was 2. Hmm.Wait, maybe I missed a pair. Let me list all possible pairs and check their slopes:1. Line 1 & 2: 2 & 3 ‚Üí Not parallel, product 6 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.2. Line 1 & 3: 2 & 6 ‚Üí Not parallel, product 12 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.3. Line 1 & 4: 2 & ( frac{5}{2} ) ‚Üí Not parallel, product 5 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.4. Line 1 & 5: 2 & 2 ‚Üí Parallel.5. Line 1 & 6: 2 & -1 ‚Üí Not parallel, product -2 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.6.

Line 2 & 5: 3 & 2 ‚Üí Not parallel, product 6 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.9. Line 2 & 6: 3 & -1 ‚Üí Not parallel, product -3 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.10. Line 3 & 4: 6 & ( frac{5}{2} ) ‚Üí Not parallel, product 15 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.11. Line 3 & 5: 6 & 2 ‚Üí Not parallel, product 12 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.12. Line 3 & 6: 6 & -1 ‚Üí Not parallel, product -6 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.13. Line 4 & 5: ( frac{5}{2} ) & 2 ‚Üí Not parallel, product 5 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.14. Line 4 & 6: ( frac{5}{2} ) & -1 ‚Üí Not parallel, product ( -frac{5}{2} ) ‚Üí Not perpendicular.15. Line 5 & 6: 2 & -1 ‚Üí Not parallel, product -2 ‚Üí Not perpendicular.So, after checking all 15 possible pairs, only one pair (lines 1 and 5) is parallel, and none are perpendicular.Therefore, the total number of pairs that are either parallel or perpendicular is 1.But wait, the assistant's answer was 2. Maybe the assistant considered lines 2 and 6 as perpendicular, but their slopes multiply to -3, not -1. So, that's incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the assistant made a mistake in calculating the slopes.Wait, let me check line 2 again: ( 2y = 6x + 8 ). Divided by 2, ( y = 3x + 4 ). Correct, slope 3.Line 6: ( y = -x + 3 ). Slope -1.3 * (-1) = -3 ‚â† -1.So, not perpendicular.Therefore, the correct answer should be 1 pair.But the assistant's answer was 2.

Therefore, total pairs are 1.But the assistant's answer was 2. So, perhaps the assistant made a mistake.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the pairs.Wait, perhaps the assistant considered lines 2 and 6 as perpendicular, but as we saw, their slopes multiply to -3, not -1. So, that's incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the assistant considered lines 4 and 6 as perpendicular. Let's check: ( frac{5}{2} ) and -1. ( frac{5}{2} * (-1) = -frac{5}{2} ), which is not -1.Alternatively, maybe lines 3 and 6: 6 and -1. 6 * (-1) = -6 ‚â† -1.No, that's not it.Alternatively, maybe lines 1 and 6: 2 and -1. 2 * (-1) = -2 ‚â† -1.No.So, I think the assistant made a mistake by considering lines 2 and 6 as perpendicular, but they are not.Therefore, the correct answer should be 1 pair.But wait, the problem says \\"pairs of these lines are either parallel or perpendicular.\\" So, if there are no perpendicular pairs, then only one pair is parallel.Therefore, the answer is 1.But the assistant's answer was 2. So, perhaps the assistant made a mistake.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the slopes.Wait, let me check line 2 again: ( 2y = 6x + 8 ). Divided by 2, ( y = 3x + 4 ). Correct, slope 3.Line 6: ( y = -x + 3 ). Slope -1.3 * (-1) = -3 ‚â† -1.So, not perpendicular.Therefore, the correct answer is 1 pair.But the assistant's answer was 2. So, perhaps the assistant made a mistake.Alternatively, maybe the problem was miswritten. Let me check the problem again.The lines are:1. ( y = 2x + 7 )2. ( 2y = 6x + 8 )3. ( 3y = 18x + 6 )4. ( 2y = 5x + 11 )5. ( 4y = 8x + 12 )6. ( y = -x + 3 )Yes, that's correct.So, in conclusion, only one pair is parallel, and no pairs are perpendicular. Therefore, the total number of pairs is 1.But the assistant's answer was 2. So, perhaps the assistant made a mistake.Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem.Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of pairs, not the number of relationships. So, if there are two relationships (one parallel and one perpendicular), but in reality, only one relationship exists, then the answer is 1.But the problem says \\"how many pairs of these lines are either parallel or perpendicular.\\" So, each pair is counted once, regardless of how many relationships they have.So, if a pair is both parallel and perpendicular, which is impossible, but in this case, only one pair is parallel, and none are perpendicular. So, total pairs are 1.Therefore, the correct answer is 1.But the assistant's answer was 2. So, perhaps the assistant made a mistake.Alternatively, maybe the assistant considered lines 2 and 6 as perpendicular, but as we saw, they are not.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 1 pair."},{"question":"20 points are positioned on a circle. These 20 points are pairwise connected by 10 chords, such that no chords share endpoints and no chords intersect.In how many ways can this be done?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 20 points on a circle, and I need to connect them with 10 chords such that no two chords share an endpoint and no two chords intersect each other. I need to figure out how many ways this can be done. Hmm, that sounds like a combinatorial problem, maybe something to do with Catalan numbers? I remember that Catalan numbers count the number of ways to correctly match parentheses, which is similar to connecting points on a circle without intersections. Let me think more about that.First, let me recall what Catalan numbers are. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:[ C_n = frac{1}{n+1} binom{2n}{n} ]And they count various combinatorial structures, including the number of non-crossing chord diagrams on 2n points on a circle. So, in this case, since there are 20 points, that would be 10 chords, so n=10. Therefore, the number of ways should be the 10th Catalan number. Let me verify that.But wait, maybe I should derive it myself to make sure. Let's consider the problem recursively. Suppose I fix one point on the circle, say point A. This point must be connected to some other point, say point B. When I connect A and B, the circle is divided into two separate regions: one on the left of the chord AB and one on the right. Each of these regions must also be connected with non-intersecting chords.If I connect A to the next point clockwise, then the chord AB divides the circle into two regions: one with 0 points and one with 18 points. Wait, no, if I connect A to the next point, that would leave 18 points on one side, but actually, the number of points on each side must be even because we need to pair them all. So, if I connect A to the k-th point, then there will be 2k points on one side and 20 - 2k - 2 points on the other side. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust that.Actually, if I fix point A and connect it to point B, which is k points away, then the chord AB divides the circle into two separate regions, each containing an even number of points. Specifically, if there are 2n points, connecting point 1 to point 2k+1 would leave 2k points on one side and 2(n - k - 1) points on the other side. Therefore, the number of ways to connect the points on each side would be the product of the Catalan numbers for each side.So, the recursive formula for Catalan numbers is:[ C_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n - k - 1} ]With the base case ( C_0 = 1 ).Let me test this with small n. For n=1, we have ( C_1 = C_0 C_0 = 1 times 1 = 1 ). For n=2, ( C_2 = C_0 C_1 + C_1 C_0 = 1 times 1 + 1 times 1 = 2 ). For n=3, ( C_3 = C_0 C_2 + C_1 C_1 + C_2 C_0 = 1 times 2 + 1 times 1 + 2 times 1 = 5 ). That seems correct.So, to find ( C_{10} ), I can either use the recursive formula or the direct formula. The direct formula is more efficient, so let me use that. The formula is:[ C_n = frac{1}{n+1} binom{2n}{n} ]Plugging in n=10:[ C_{10} = frac{1}{11} binom{20}{10} ]I need to compute ( binom{20}{10} ). Let me recall that ( binom{20}{10} = frac{20!}{10!10!} ). Calculating factorials can be tedious, but I remember that ( binom{20}{10} = 184756 ). Let me verify that:20! / (10! * 10!) = (20√ó19√ó18√ó17√ó16√ó15√ó14√ó13√ó12√ó11) / (10√ó9√ó8√ó7√ó6√ó5√ó4√ó3√ó2√ó1)Calculating numerator:20√ó19=380380√ó18=68406840√ó17=116280116280√ó16=18604801860480√ó15=2790720027907200√ó14=390700800390700800√ó13=50791104005079110400√ó12=6094932480060949324800√ó11=670442572800Denominator:10√ó9=9090√ó8=720720√ó7=50405040√ó6=3024030240√ó5=151200151200√ó4=604800604800√ó3=18144001814400√ó2=36288003628800√ó1=3628800So, ( binom{20}{10} = 670442572800 / 3628800 ). Let me compute that division.First, divide numerator and denominator by 100: 6704425728 / 36288.Now, let's compute 6704425728 √∑ 36288.Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 6704425728 √∑ 16 = 419026608, and 36288 √∑ 16 = 2268.So, now it's 419026608 √∑ 2268.Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 419026608 √∑ 12 = 34918884, and 2268 √∑ 12 = 189.So, now it's 34918884 √∑ 189.Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 34918884 √∑ 9 = 3879876, and 189 √∑ 9 = 21.So, now it's 3879876 √∑ 21.Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 3879876 √∑ 3 = 1293292, and 21 √∑ 3 = 7.So, now it's 1293292 √∑ 7.1293292 √∑ 7 = 184756.Yes, that checks out. So, ( binom{20}{10} = 184756 ).Therefore, ( C_{10} = frac{1}{11} times 184756 ).Calculating that: 184756 √∑ 11.11 √ó 16796 = 184756, because 16796 √ó 10 = 167960, and 16796 √ó 1 = 16796, so 167960 + 16796 = 184756.So, ( C_{10} = 16796 ).Therefore, the number of ways to connect the 20 points with 10 non-intersecting chords is 16796.I think that makes sense. I started by recognizing the problem as related to Catalan numbers, verified the recursive formula, computed the necessary binomial coefficient, and then applied the Catalan number formula. The result seems reasonable, and I double-checked the calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. So, I'm confident that the answer is 16796."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, two tangents are drawn from point P(-5,a) to the circle x^{2}+y^{2}-2ax+2y-1=0. The points of tangency are M(x_{1},y_{1}) and N(x_{2},y_{2}), and it is given that frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}+frac{x_{1}+x_{2}-2}{y_{1}+y_{2}}=0. Find the value of the real number a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a point P(-5, a) and a circle defined by the equation x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 2ax + 2y - 1 = 0. From point P, two tangents are drawn to the circle, and the points where these tangents touch the circle are M(x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) and N(x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ). There's also this condition given: (y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ) + (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ - 2)/(y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ) = 0. I need to find the value of a.Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. First, I should probably rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form to find its center and radius. The given equation is x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 2ax + 2y - 1 = 0. To convert this into standard form, I can complete the squares for both x and y terms.For the x terms: x¬≤ - 2ax. Completing the square, I take half of -2a, which is -a, square it to get a¬≤, and add and subtract it. So, x¬≤ - 2ax + a¬≤ - a¬≤.For the y terms: y¬≤ + 2y. Completing the square, half of 2 is 1, square it to get 1, and add and subtract it. So, y¬≤ + 2y + 1 - 1.Putting it all together, the equation becomes:(x¬≤ - 2ax + a¬≤) + (y¬≤ + 2y + 1) = a¬≤ + 1 + 1Wait, let me check that. The original equation is x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 2ax + 2y - 1 = 0. So, moving the constant term to the other side:x¬≤ - 2ax + y¬≤ + 2y = 1Now, completing the squares:(x¬≤ - 2ax + a¬≤) + (y¬≤ + 2y + 1) = 1 + a¬≤ + 1So, that simplifies to:(x - a)¬≤ + (y + 1)¬≤ = a¬≤ + 2So, the center of the circle is at (a, -1) and the radius is sqrt(a¬≤ + 2). Okay, that's good to know.Now, point P is (-5, a). From this point, two tangents are drawn to the circle, touching it at points M and N. The condition given is (y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ) + (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ - 2)/(y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ) = 0.Let me think about what this condition represents. The first term, (y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ), is the slope of the line MN. The second term, (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ - 2)/(y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ), seems a bit more complicated. Maybe it's related to some other slope or perhaps the midpoint of MN?Let me denote the midpoint of MN as Q. So, Q would have coordinates ((x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ)/2, (y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ)/2). Let me denote this as Q(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ). Then, (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ - 2) is 2x‚ÇÄ - 2, and (y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ) is 2y‚ÇÄ. So, the second term becomes (2x‚ÇÄ - 2)/(2y‚ÇÄ) = (x‚ÇÄ - 1)/y‚ÇÄ.So, the given condition simplifies to:Slope of MN + (x‚ÇÄ - 1)/y‚ÇÄ = 0Which means:Slope of MN = - (x‚ÇÄ - 1)/y‚ÇÄBut the slope of MN is also equal to (y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ). So, putting it together:(y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ) = - (x‚ÇÄ - 1)/y‚ÇÄHmm, interesting. So, the slope of MN is equal to the negative of (x‚ÇÄ - 1)/y‚ÇÄ.I remember that in circle geometry, the line from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord MN is perpendicular to the chord MN. So, the slope of the line connecting the center R(a, -1) to the midpoint Q(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) is perpendicular to the slope of MN.So, the slope of RQ is (y‚ÇÄ + 1)/(x‚ÇÄ - a). Since RQ is perpendicular to MN, the product of their slopes should be -1.So, slope of MN * slope of RQ = -1From earlier, slope of MN is (y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ) = - (x‚ÇÄ - 1)/y‚ÇÄSlope of RQ is (y‚ÇÄ + 1)/(x‚ÇÄ - a)Therefore:[- (x‚ÇÄ - 1)/y‚ÇÄ] * [(y‚ÇÄ + 1)/(x‚ÇÄ - a)] = -1Simplify this equation:[- (x‚ÇÄ - 1)(y‚ÇÄ + 1)] / [y‚ÇÄ(x‚ÇÄ - a)] = -1Multiply both sides by y‚ÇÄ(x‚ÇÄ - a):- (x‚ÇÄ - 1)(y‚ÇÄ + 1) = - y‚ÇÄ(x‚ÇÄ - a)Simplify the negatives:(x‚ÇÄ - 1)(y‚ÇÄ + 1) = y‚ÇÄ(x‚ÇÄ - a)Expand both sides:x‚ÇÄ y‚ÇÄ + x‚ÇÄ - y‚ÇÄ - 1 = x‚ÇÄ y‚ÇÄ - a y‚ÇÄSubtract x‚ÇÄ y‚ÇÄ from both sides:x‚ÇÄ - y‚ÇÄ - 1 = -a y‚ÇÄBring all terms to one side:x‚ÇÄ - y‚ÇÄ - 1 + a y‚ÇÄ = 0Factor y‚ÇÄ:x‚ÇÄ + y‚ÇÄ(a - 1) - 1 = 0Hmm, okay. So, this is one equation involving x‚ÇÄ and y‚ÇÄ.But I also know that Q(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) is the midpoint of MN, which is the chord of contact from point P(-5, a). There's a formula for the equation of the chord of contact from an external point to a circle.The equation of the chord of contact from point P(h, k) to the circle (x - c)¬≤ + (y - d)¬≤ = r¬≤ is given by:(h - c)(x - c) + (k - d)(y - d) = r¬≤Wait, no, actually, the equation is:(h - c)(x - c) + (k - d)(y - d) = r¬≤But I think I might be mixing it up. Let me recall. The equation of the chord of contact from point P(h, k) to the circle S = 0 is T = 0, where T is obtained by replacing x¬≤ with h x, y¬≤ with k y, etc.Wait, yes, that's correct. For the circle S: x¬≤ + y¬≤ + Dx + Ey + F = 0, the equation of the chord of contact from point (h, k) is:h x + k y + D*(x + h)/2 + E*(y + k)/2 + F = 0Wait, maybe I should use the standard formula. Alternatively, since I have the center and radius, maybe I can find the equation of the chord of contact.Alternatively, since Q is the midpoint of MN, and R is the center, then RQ is perpendicular to MN, as I mentioned earlier.Also, since P is the external point, the line PR is the line joining P(-5, a) to R(a, -1). The midpoint Q lies on this line as well, because the line from P to R passes through Q.Wait, is that true? Hmm, not necessarily. The midpoint Q of the chord MN lies on the polar of P with respect to the circle, which is the chord of contact MN.But perhaps another approach is better.Let me recall that the midpoint Q of the chord MN satisfies the equation of the circle and also lies on the line joining the center R(a, -1) to Q(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ). Wait, no, actually, RQ is perpendicular to MN, but Q is the midpoint.Alternatively, since Q is the midpoint, it lies on the polar of P, which is the chord of contact MN.Wait, maybe I can find the equation of the chord of contact MN from point P(-5, a).The equation of the chord of contact from P(h, k) to the circle S = 0 is T = 0, where T is:h x + k y + D*(x + h)/2 + E*(y + k)/2 + F = 0Wait, let me write the circle equation again: x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 2a x + 2 y - 1 = 0.So, comparing to the general circle equation x¬≤ + y¬≤ + D x + E y + F = 0, we have D = -2a, E = 2, F = -1.So, the equation of the chord of contact from P(-5, a) is:(-5) x + a y + (-2a)*(x + (-5))/2 + 2*(y + a)/2 - 1 = 0Wait, let me use the formula correctly. The equation of the chord of contact from (h, k) is:h x + k y + D*(x + h)/2 + E*(y + k)/2 + F = 0So, plugging in h = -5, k = a, D = -2a, E = 2, F = -1:(-5) x + a y + (-2a)*(x + (-5))/2 + 2*(y + a)/2 - 1 = 0Simplify each term:First term: -5xSecond term: a yThird term: (-2a)*(x - 5)/2 = (-2a/2)(x - 5) = -a(x - 5) = -a x + 5aFourth term: 2*(y + a)/2 = (y + a)Fifth term: -1So, putting it all together:-5x + a y - a x + 5a + y + a - 1 = 0Combine like terms:(-5x - a x) + (a y + y) + (5a + a - 1) = 0Factor x and y:x(-5 - a) + y(a + 1) + (6a - 1) = 0So, the equation of chord MN is:(-5 - a)x + (a + 1)y + (6a - 1) = 0Okay, so that's the equation of MN.Now, since Q(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) is the midpoint of MN, it lies on this line. So, plugging Q into the equation:(-5 - a)x‚ÇÄ + (a + 1)y‚ÇÄ + (6a - 1) = 0That's one equation.Earlier, we had another equation from the condition given:x‚ÇÄ + y‚ÇÄ(a - 1) - 1 = 0So, now we have two equations:1. (-5 - a)x‚ÇÄ + (a + 1)y‚ÇÄ + (6a - 1) = 02. x‚ÇÄ + y‚ÇÄ(a - 1) - 1 = 0Let me write them again:Equation (1): (-5 - a)x‚ÇÄ + (a + 1)y‚ÇÄ + (6a - 1) = 0Equation (2): x‚ÇÄ + (a - 1)y‚ÇÄ - 1 = 0Now, we can solve these two equations for x‚ÇÄ and y‚ÇÄ in terms of a.Let me denote Equation (2) as:x‚ÇÄ = 1 - (a - 1)y‚ÇÄSo, x‚ÇÄ = 1 - (a - 1)y‚ÇÄNow, substitute this into Equation (1):(-5 - a)[1 - (a - 1)y‚ÇÄ] + (a + 1)y‚ÇÄ + (6a - 1) = 0Let me expand this:(-5 - a)*1 + (-5 - a)*[-(a - 1)y‚ÇÄ] + (a + 1)y‚ÇÄ + (6a - 1) = 0Simplify term by term:First term: (-5 - a)Second term: (5 + a)(a - 1)y‚ÇÄThird term: (a + 1)y‚ÇÄFourth term: (6a - 1)So, combining:(-5 - a) + (5 + a)(a - 1)y‚ÇÄ + (a + 1)y‚ÇÄ + (6a - 1) = 0Combine the constants:(-5 - a + 6a - 1) = (-6 + 5a)Combine the y‚ÇÄ terms:[(5 + a)(a - 1) + (a + 1)] y‚ÇÄLet me compute (5 + a)(a - 1):= 5(a - 1) + a(a - 1)= 5a - 5 + a¬≤ - a= a¬≤ + 4a - 5Now, add (a + 1):= a¬≤ + 4a - 5 + a + 1= a¬≤ + 5a - 4So, the equation becomes:(-6 + 5a) + (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)y‚ÇÄ = 0Now, from Equation (2), we have x‚ÇÄ = 1 - (a - 1)y‚ÇÄBut we can express y‚ÇÄ in terms of x‚ÇÄ, but maybe it's better to express y‚ÇÄ from Equation (2):From Equation (2):x‚ÇÄ + (a - 1)y‚ÇÄ - 1 = 0So,(a - 1)y‚ÇÄ = 1 - x‚ÇÄThus,y‚ÇÄ = (1 - x‚ÇÄ)/(a - 1)But we already substituted x‚ÇÄ in terms of y‚ÇÄ earlier, so maybe it's better to solve for y‚ÇÄ from the current equation.Wait, in the equation we have:(-6 + 5a) + (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)y‚ÇÄ = 0So,(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)y‚ÇÄ = 6 - 5aThus,y‚ÇÄ = (6 - 5a)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)Okay, so now we have y‚ÇÄ in terms of a.Now, let's recall that Q(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) is the midpoint of MN, which is the chord of contact from P(-5, a). Also, since Q lies on the line RQ, which is the line from the center R(a, -1) to Q(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ), and we know that RQ is perpendicular to MN.Wait, but we already used that fact earlier to get the condition leading to Equation (2). Maybe another approach is needed.Alternatively, since Q is the midpoint, it also lies on the polar of P, which is the chord MN. Wait, but we already used that to get Equation (1). So, perhaps we need another condition.Wait, maybe we can use the fact that the distance from P to the circle is equal to the length of the tangent from P to the circle. The length of the tangent from P(h, k) to the circle with center (c, d) and radius r is sqrt[(h - c)¬≤ + (k - d)¬≤ - r¬≤].So, in this case, the length of the tangent from P(-5, a) to the circle with center (a, -1) and radius sqrt(a¬≤ + 2) is:sqrt[(-5 - a)¬≤ + (a - (-1))¬≤ - (a¬≤ + 2)]Simplify:sqrt[(25 + 10a + a¬≤) + (a + 1)¬≤ - a¬≤ - 2]First, expand (a + 1)¬≤:= a¬≤ + 2a + 1So, inside the sqrt:25 + 10a + a¬≤ + a¬≤ + 2a + 1 - a¬≤ - 2Combine like terms:25 + 10a + a¬≤ + a¬≤ + 2a + 1 - a¬≤ - 2= (25 + 1) - 2 + (10a + 2a) + (a¬≤ + a¬≤ - a¬≤)= 24 + 12a + a¬≤So, the length of the tangent is sqrt(a¬≤ + 12a + 24)But the length of the tangent is also equal to the distance from P to the circle, which is equal to the distance from P to the center minus the radius, but actually, it's computed as sqrt[(distance from P to center)^2 - radius^2].Wait, yes, that's correct. So, the length of the tangent is sqrt[(distance from P to center)^2 - radius^2].Distance from P(-5, a) to center R(a, -1):= sqrt[(-5 - a)^2 + (a - (-1))^2]= sqrt[(25 + 10a + a¬≤) + (a + 1)^2]= sqrt[25 + 10a + a¬≤ + a¬≤ + 2a + 1]= sqrt[2a¬≤ + 12a + 26]Radius squared is a¬≤ + 2.So, length of tangent squared is (2a¬≤ + 12a + 26) - (a¬≤ + 2) = a¬≤ + 12a + 24, which matches what we had earlier.So, the length of the tangent is sqrt(a¬≤ + 12a + 24). But I'm not sure how this helps directly, but maybe it's useful later.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the midpoint Q lies on the line PR, which connects P(-5, a) and R(a, -1). Let me check if that's true.Wait, in general, the midpoint of the chord of contact from P lies on the polar of P, which is the chord MN itself. But does it lie on PR? Hmm, not necessarily. Wait, but in some cases, it might. Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps the line PR passes through Q. Let me check.The line PR connects P(-5, a) and R(a, -1). Let me find the equation of line PR.The slope of PR is ( -1 - a ) / (a - (-5)) = (-1 - a)/(a + 5)So, the equation is:(y - a) = [(-1 - a)/(a + 5)](x + 5)Now, since Q(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) lies on this line, it must satisfy:y‚ÇÄ - a = [(-1 - a)/(a + 5)](x‚ÇÄ + 5)So, that's another equation involving x‚ÇÄ and y‚ÇÄ.So, now we have three equations:1. (-5 - a)x‚ÇÄ + (a + 1)y‚ÇÄ + (6a - 1) = 02. x‚ÇÄ + (a - 1)y‚ÇÄ - 1 = 03. y‚ÇÄ - a = [(-1 - a)/(a + 5)](x‚ÇÄ + 5)So, now we can use these three equations to solve for x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ, and a.But since we already have expressions for x‚ÇÄ and y‚ÇÄ in terms of a from Equations (1) and (2), we can substitute them into Equation (3) to solve for a.From Equation (2):x‚ÇÄ = 1 - (a - 1)y‚ÇÄFrom Equation (1):(-5 - a)x‚ÇÄ + (a + 1)y‚ÇÄ + (6a - 1) = 0We already solved for y‚ÇÄ in terms of a:y‚ÇÄ = (6 - 5a)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)And x‚ÇÄ = 1 - (a - 1)y‚ÇÄSo, x‚ÇÄ = 1 - (a - 1)*(6 - 5a)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)Let me compute x‚ÇÄ:x‚ÇÄ = 1 - [(a - 1)(6 - 5a)] / (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)Let me compute the numerator:(a - 1)(6 - 5a) = 6a - 5a¬≤ - 6 + 5a = (-5a¬≤) + 11a - 6So,x‚ÇÄ = 1 - [(-5a¬≤ + 11a - 6)] / (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)= 1 + (5a¬≤ - 11a + 6)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)To combine the terms, write 1 as (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4):= [a¬≤ + 5a - 4 + 5a¬≤ - 11a + 6] / (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)Combine like terms in the numerator:a¬≤ + 5a - 4 + 5a¬≤ - 11a + 6 = 6a¬≤ - 6a + 2So,x‚ÇÄ = (6a¬≤ - 6a + 2)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)Okay, so now we have x‚ÇÄ and y‚ÇÄ in terms of a:x‚ÇÄ = (6a¬≤ - 6a + 2)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)y‚ÇÄ = (6 - 5a)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)Now, let's plug these into Equation (3):y‚ÇÄ - a = [(-1 - a)/(a + 5)](x‚ÇÄ + 5)So,[(6 - 5a)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)] - a = [(-1 - a)/(a + 5)] * [ (6a¬≤ - 6a + 2)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4) + 5 ]Let me simplify the right-hand side first.Compute x‚ÇÄ + 5:= (6a¬≤ - 6a + 2)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4) + 5= [6a¬≤ - 6a + 2 + 5(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)] / (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)= [6a¬≤ - 6a + 2 + 5a¬≤ + 25a - 20] / (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)Combine like terms:= (11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)So, the right-hand side becomes:[(-1 - a)/(a + 5)] * [11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)]So, the entire equation is:[(6 - 5a)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)] - a = [(-1 - a)(11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)] / [(a + 5)(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)]Let me write the left-hand side as a single fraction:= [6 - 5a - a(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)] / (a¬≤ + 5a - 4)Compute the numerator:6 - 5a - a¬≥ - 5a¬≤ + 4a= -a¬≥ - 5a¬≤ - a + 6So, left-hand side is:(-a¬≥ - 5a¬≤ - a + 6)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)So, now the equation is:(-a¬≥ - 5a¬≤ - a + 6)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4) = [(-1 - a)(11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)] / [(a + 5)(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)]Since the denominators are the same on both sides, we can equate the numerators:(-a¬≥ - 5a¬≤ - a + 6) = [(-1 - a)(11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)] / (a + 5)Multiply both sides by (a + 5):(-a¬≥ - 5a¬≤ - a + 6)(a + 5) = (-1 - a)(11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)Let me expand both sides.First, the left-hand side:(-a¬≥ - 5a¬≤ - a + 6)(a + 5)Multiply term by term:= -a¬≥*a + (-a¬≥)*5 + (-5a¬≤)*a + (-5a¬≤)*5 + (-a)*a + (-a)*5 + 6*a + 6*5= -a‚Å¥ - 5a¬≥ - 5a¬≥ - 25a¬≤ - a¬≤ - 5a + 6a + 30Combine like terms:- a‚Å¥ + (-5a¬≥ - 5a¬≥) + (-25a¬≤ - a¬≤) + (-5a + 6a) + 30= -a‚Å¥ - 10a¬≥ - 26a¬≤ + a + 30Now, the right-hand side:(-1 - a)(11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)= (-1)(11a¬≤ + 19a - 18) + (-a)(11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)= -11a¬≤ - 19a + 18 - 11a¬≥ - 19a¬≤ + 18aCombine like terms:-11a¬≥ + (-11a¬≤ - 19a¬≤) + (-19a + 18a) + 18= -11a¬≥ - 30a¬≤ - a + 18So, now we have:Left-hand side: -a‚Å¥ - 10a¬≥ - 26a¬≤ + a + 30Right-hand side: -11a¬≥ - 30a¬≤ - a + 18Bring all terms to the left-hand side:(-a‚Å¥ - 10a¬≥ - 26a¬≤ + a + 30) - (-11a¬≥ - 30a¬≤ - a + 18) = 0Simplify:- a‚Å¥ - 10a¬≥ - 26a¬≤ + a + 30 + 11a¬≥ + 30a¬≤ + a - 18 = 0Combine like terms:- a‚Å¥ + (-10a¬≥ + 11a¬≥) + (-26a¬≤ + 30a¬≤) + (a + a) + (30 - 18) = 0= -a‚Å¥ + a¬≥ + 4a¬≤ + 2a + 12 = 0Multiply both sides by -1 to make it positive leading coefficient:a‚Å¥ - a¬≥ - 4a¬≤ - 2a - 12 = 0So, we have the quartic equation:a‚Å¥ - a¬≥ - 4a¬≤ - 2a - 12 = 0Hmm, solving a quartic equation can be tricky, but maybe it factors nicely.Let me try to factor this polynomial. Let's look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 12 over factors of 1, so ¬±1, ¬±2, ¬±3, ¬±4, ¬±6, ¬±12.Let me test a = 2:2‚Å¥ - 2¬≥ - 4*2¬≤ - 2*2 - 12 = 16 - 8 - 16 - 4 - 12 = -24 ‚â† 0a = 3:81 - 27 - 36 - 6 - 12 = 0Wait, 81 - 27 = 54; 54 - 36 = 18; 18 - 6 = 12; 12 - 12 = 0Yes, a = 3 is a root.So, (a - 3) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.Using synthetic division with a = 3:Coefficients: 1 | -1 | -4 | -2 | -12Bring down the 1.Multiply by 3: 1*3 = 3. Add to next coefficient: -1 + 3 = 2.Multiply by 3: 2*3 = 6. Add to next coefficient: -4 + 6 = 2.Multiply by 3: 2*3 = 6. Add to next coefficient: -2 + 6 = 4.Multiply by 3: 4*3 = 12. Add to last coefficient: -12 + 12 = 0.So, the polynomial factors as (a - 3)(a¬≥ + 2a¬≤ + 2a + 4) = 0Now, let's factor the cubic: a¬≥ + 2a¬≤ + 2a + 4Try a = -2:(-2)^3 + 2*(-2)^2 + 2*(-2) + 4 = -8 + 8 - 4 + 4 = 0So, a = -2 is a root. Thus, (a + 2) is a factor.Perform synthetic division on the cubic with a = -2:Coefficients: 1 | 2 | 2 | 4Bring down the 1.Multiply by -2: 1*(-2) = -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0.Multiply by -2: 0*(-2) = 0. Add to next coefficient: 2 + 0 = 2.Multiply by -2: 2*(-2) = -4. Add to last coefficient: 4 + (-4) = 0.So, the cubic factors as (a + 2)(a¬≤ + 0a + 2) = (a + 2)(a¬≤ + 2)Thus, the quartic factors as:(a - 3)(a + 2)(a¬≤ + 2) = 0So, the real roots are a = 3 and a = -2. The other roots are complex since a¬≤ + 2 = 0 gives a = ¬±i‚àö2.Therefore, the possible real values of a are 3 and -2.Let me check if these values satisfy the original condition.First, a = 3:Check if the equation is satisfied.From earlier, we had:(-a¬≥ - 5a¬≤ - a + 6)/(a¬≤ + 5a - 4) = [(-1 - a)(11a¬≤ + 19a - 18)] / [(a + 5)(a¬≤ + 5a - 4)]But since we already solved the equation and found a = 3 and a = -2, these should satisfy.But let me verify with a = 3:Compute the left-hand side:(-27 - 45 - 3 + 6)/(9 + 15 - 4) = (-69)/(20)Right-hand side:[(-1 - 3)(99 + 57 - 18)] / [(8)(20)] = [(-4)(138)] / 160 = (-552)/160 = (-69)/20So, both sides equal -69/20. So, a = 3 is valid.Similarly, a = -2:Left-hand side:(-(-8) - 5*4 - (-2) + 6)/(4 + (-10) - 4) = (8 - 20 + 2 + 6)/(-10) = (-4)/(-10) = 2/5Right-hand side:[(-1 - (-2))(44 + (-38) - 18)] / [(3)(-10)] = [(1)(-12)] / (-30) = (-12)/(-30) = 2/5So, both sides equal 2/5. Thus, a = -2 is also valid.Therefore, the real numbers a are 3 and -2."},{"question":"Joe needs to paint all the airplane hangars at the airport, so he buys 360 gallons of paint to do the job.

On each move, it randomly selects one of the three corners where it is not currently located and crawls along an edge of the square to that vertex. Determine the probability that the bug returns to its starting corner on its eighth move, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n. Find m + n.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a bug starts at a corner of a square, and every move, it randomly chooses one of the three other corners and crawls along an edge to that corner. I need to find the probability that the bug returns to its starting corner on its eighth move. The answer should be a reduced fraction m/n, and then I have to find m + n.Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a problem that involves probability and maybe some recurrence relations. Since the bug is moving on a square, which has four corners, and it can't stay in the same corner; it has to move to one of the three others each time.So, maybe I can model this as a Markov chain with states representing the corners. But since the square is symmetric, maybe I can simplify it by considering the states as being either at the starting corner or not. That is, instead of tracking each specific corner, I can just track whether the bug is at the starting corner or somewhere else. That might make the problem easier.Let me denote Q_n as the probability that the bug is at the starting corner after n moves. Then, the probability that it's not at the starting corner after n moves would be 1 - Q_n.Now, how does Q_n relate to Q_{n-1}? Well, if the bug is at the starting corner after n moves, it must have been at one of the other three corners on the (n-1)th move. From any of those three corners, the bug has a 1/3 chance to move back to the starting corner.So, the recurrence relation would be:Q_n = (1/3) * (1 - Q_{n-1})Because the probability of being at the starting corner on the nth move is the probability that it was not there on the (n-1)th move times the probability of moving back, which is 1/3.Okay, that makes sense. Now, what is the initial condition? At n=0, the bug is at the starting corner, so Q_0 = 1.Let me write down the recurrence relation and the initial condition:Q_n = (1/3)(1 - Q_{n-1}), for n >= 1Q_0 = 1Now, I need to compute Q_8. To do that, I can compute Q_1, Q_2, ..., up to Q_8 step by step.Let me start calculating:Q_0 = 1Q_1 = (1/3)(1 - Q_0) = (1/3)(1 - 1) = 0Q_2 = (1/3)(1 - Q_1) = (1/3)(1 - 0) = 1/3Q_3 = (1/3)(1 - Q_2) = (1/3)(1 - 1/3) = (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9Q_4 = (1/3)(1 - Q_3) = (1/3)(1 - 2/9) = (1/3)(7/9) = 7/27Q_5 = (1/3)(1 - Q_4) = (1/3)(1 - 7/27) = (1/3)(20/27) = 20/81Q_6 = (1/3)(1 - Q_5) = (1/3)(1 - 20/81) = (1/3)(61/81) = 61/243Q_7 = (1/3)(1 - Q_6) = (1/3)(1 - 61/243) = (1/3)(182/243) = 182/729Q_8 = (1/3)(1 - Q_7) = (1/3)(1 - 182/729) = (1/3)(547/729) = 547/2187So, Q_8 is 547/2187. Now, I need to make sure this fraction is reduced. Let's check if 547 and 2187 have any common factors.First, 547 is a prime number? Let me check. 547 divided by 2 is not whole, 547 divided by 3 is 182.333..., not whole. 547 divided by 5 is 109.4, nope. 7? 547/7 is about 78.14, not whole. 11? 547/11 is about 49.727, nope. 13? 547/13 is about 42.07, nope. 17? 547/17 is about 32.176, nope. 19? 547/19 is about 28.789, nope. 23? 547/23 is about 23.782, nope. 29? 547/29 is about 18.862, nope. 31? 547/31 is about 17.645, nope. So, 547 is a prime number.2187 is a known number; it's 3^7 because 3^7 = 2187. So, 2187 factors are only powers of 3. Since 547 is prime and not a multiple of 3, the fraction 547/2187 is already in its simplest form.Therefore, m is 547 and n is 2187. So, m + n is 547 + 2187.Let me compute that: 547 + 2000 is 2547, and then +187 is 2734.So, the answer is 2734.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the recurrence:Q_0 = 1Q_1 = 0Q_2 = 1/3Q_3 = 2/9Q_4 = 7/27Q_5 = 20/81Q_6 = 61/243Q_7 = 182/729Q_8 = 547/2187Yes, that seems consistent. Each step, I subtract the previous Q from 1, multiply by 1/3, and get the next Q. So, the calculations look correct.Therefore, I'm confident that the probability is 547/2187, and m + n is 2734.**Final Answer**boxed{2734}"},{"question":"A factory produces 4560 toys per week.

Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I remember that an ellipse is defined as the set of points where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant. The standard equation of an ellipse centered at the origin is (frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), where (a) is the semi-major axis and (b) is the semi-minor axis. The distance from the center to each focus is (c), where (c^2 = a^2 - b^2).Now, the problem mentions the \\"segment of the tangent to the ellipse, which lies between the vertex tangents.\\" I think the vertex tangents are the tangents at the vertices of the ellipse. For the standard ellipse, the vertices are at ((pm a, 0)). So, the tangents at these points should be vertical lines, right? Wait, no, actually, the tangent at ((a, 0)) is the line (x = a), and similarly, the tangent at ((-a, 0)) is (x = -a). So, the segment of the tangent that lies between these two tangents would be the portion of the tangent line that's between (x = -a) and (x = a).Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. If the tangent is at some point on the ellipse, say ((x_0, y_0)), then the tangent line at that point is (frac{x x_0}{a^2} + frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1). So, the segment between the vertex tangents would be the portion of this tangent line that lies between the two vertical lines (x = -a) and (x = a). So, if I find the points where this tangent intersects (x = -a) and (x = a), those would be the endpoints of the segment.Let me write that down. For a general point ((x_0, y_0)) on the ellipse, the tangent line is (frac{x x_0}{a^2} + frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1). To find where this tangent intersects (x = -a), substitute (x = -a) into the equation:[frac{(-a) x_0}{a^2} + frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1 implies -frac{x_0}{a} + frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1 + frac{x_0}{a} implies y = frac{b^2}{y_0} left(1 + frac{x_0}{a}right)]Similarly, for (x = a):[frac{a x_0}{a^2} + frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{x_0}{a} + frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1 - frac{x_0}{a} implies y = frac{b^2}{y_0} left(1 - frac{x_0}{a}right)]So, the points of intersection are (M(-a, frac{b^2}{y_0}(1 + frac{x_0}{a}))) and (N(a, frac{b^2}{y_0}(1 - frac{x_0}{a}))). So, the segment (MN) is the portion of the tangent between these two points.Now, the problem states that this segment (MN) is seen from any focus at an angle of (90^circ). So, if I take one of the foci, say (F_1 = (-c, 0)), and look at the lines (F_1M) and (F_1N), the angle between them should be (90^circ). Similarly, for the other focus (F_2 = (c, 0)), the angle between (F_2M) and (F_2N) should also be (90^circ).To prove that the angle between (F_1M) and (F_1N) is (90^circ), I can use the property that two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is (-1). So, I need to find the slopes of (F_1M) and (F_1N) and show that their product is (-1).Let's compute the slope of (F_1M). The coordinates of (F_1) are ((-c, 0)) and (M) is ((-a, frac{b^2}{y_0}(1 + frac{x_0}{a}))). So, the slope (m_1) is:[m_1 = frac{frac{b^2}{y_0}left(1 + frac{x_0}{a}right) - 0}{-a - (-c)} = frac{frac{b^2}{y_0}left(1 + frac{x_0}{a}right)}{c - a}]Similarly, the slope (m_2) of (F_1N) is:[m_2 = frac{frac{b^2}{y_0}left(1 - frac{x_0}{a}right) - 0}{a - (-c)} = frac{frac{b^2}{y_0}left(1 - frac{x_0}{a}right)}{a + c}]Now, let's compute the product (m_1 times m_2):[m_1 m_2 = left(frac{frac{b^2}{y_0}left(1 + frac{x_0}{a}right)}{c - a}right) times left(frac{frac{b^2}{y_0}left(1 - frac{x_0}{a}right)}{a + c}right)]Simplify the numerator:[left(frac{b^2}{y_0}right)^2 left(1 + frac{x_0}{a}right)left(1 - frac{x_0}{a}right) = left(frac{b^4}{y_0^2}right) left(1 - frac{x_0^2}{a^2}right)]And the denominator:[(c - a)(a + c) = c^2 - a^2 = (a^2 - b^2) - a^2 = -b^2]So, putting it together:[m_1 m_2 = frac{frac{b^4}{y_0^2} left(1 - frac{x_0^2}{a^2}right)}{-b^2} = -frac{b^2}{y_0^2} left(1 - frac{x_0^2}{a^2}right)]But since ((x_0, y_0)) lies on the ellipse, we have:[frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1 implies 1 - frac{x_0^2}{a^2} = frac{y_0^2}{b^2}]Substituting this back into the expression for (m_1 m_2):[m_1 m_2 = -frac{b^2}{y_0^2} times frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = -1]So, the product of the slopes is (-1), which means the lines (F_1M) and (F_1N) are perpendicular. Therefore, the angle between them is (90^circ).Similarly, the same reasoning applies for the other focus (F_2 = (c, 0)). The slopes of (F_2M) and (F_2N) would also multiply to (-1), showing that the angle is (90^circ).Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I found the points of intersection correctly, computed the slopes, multiplied them, and used the ellipse equation to simplify. Everything seems to check out. So, yes, the segment between the vertex tangents is indeed seen from any focus at a right angle."},{"question":"Expand and simplify the expression: ((1+x^3)(1-x^4)(1+x^5)).A) (1 + x^3 - x^4 + x^5 - x^7 + x^8 - x^9 - x^{12})B) (1 - x^4 + x^3 - x^5 + x^7 - x^8 + x^9 - x^{12})C) (1 + x^3 - x^4 + x^5 + x^8 - x^7 - x^9 - x^{12})D) (1 + x^3 - x^4 + x^5 - x^6 + x^7 - x^8 - x^{12})","answer":"Okay, so I have this expression to expand and simplify: ((1 + x^3)(1 - x^4)(1 + x^5)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it step by step. Let me break it down.First, I remember that when you have multiple binomials multiplied together, you can expand them one by one. So maybe I should start by expanding the first two binomials, ((1 + x^3)) and ((1 - x^4)), and then multiply the result by the third binomial, ((1 + x^5)). That seems manageable.Alright, let's start with ((1 + x^3)(1 - x^4)). I think I can use the distributive property here, also known as the FOIL method for two binomials. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, which refers to the terms you need to multiply.So, applying FOIL:- First: Multiply the first terms in each binomial: (1 times 1 = 1).- Outer: Multiply the outer terms: (1 times (-x^4) = -x^4).- Inner: Multiply the inner terms: (x^3 times 1 = x^3).- Last: Multiply the last terms in each binomial: (x^3 times (-x^4) = -x^7).Now, adding all these together: (1 - x^4 + x^3 - x^7). Let me write that down: (1 + x^3 - x^4 - x^7). Hmm, that looks right. I should make sure to arrange the terms in order of ascending powers of (x), so it's (1 + x^3 - x^4 - x^7).Okay, so now I have the product of the first two binomials. The next step is to multiply this result by the third binomial, which is ((1 + x^5)). So, I need to multiply each term in (1 + x^3 - x^4 - x^7) by each term in (1 + x^5).Let me write that out step by step:1. Multiply (1) by each term in ((1 + x^5)):   - (1 times 1 = 1)   - (1 times x^5 = x^5)2. Multiply (x^3) by each term in ((1 + x^5)):   - (x^3 times 1 = x^3)   - (x^3 times x^5 = x^{8})3. Multiply (-x^4) by each term in ((1 + x^5)):   - (-x^4 times 1 = -x^4)   - (-x^4 times x^5 = -x^{9})4. Multiply (-x^7) by each term in ((1 + x^5)):   - (-x^7 times 1 = -x^7)   - (-x^7 times x^5 = -x^{12})Now, let me list all these products:- From (1 times (1 + x^5)): (1 + x^5)- From (x^3 times (1 + x^5)): (x^3 + x^8)- From (-x^4 times (1 + x^5)): (-x^4 - x^9)- From (-x^7 times (1 + x^5)): (-x^7 - x^{12})Now, I need to combine all these terms together:(1 + x^5 + x^3 + x^8 - x^4 - x^9 - x^7 - x^{12})Next, I should arrange these terms in order of ascending powers of (x):- The constant term: (1)- (x^3)- (-x^4)- (x^5)- (-x^7)- (x^8)- (-x^9)- (-x^{12})So, putting it all together:(1 + x^3 - x^4 + x^5 - x^7 + x^8 - x^9 - x^{12})Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any terms or make any sign errors.

Then multiplied each term by ((1 + x^5)), which gave me the terms (1, x^5, x^3, x^8, -x^4, -x^9, -x^7, -x^{12}). Combining these gives the expression above.Looking at the answer choices:A) (1 + x^3 - x^4 + x^5 - x^7 + x^8 - x^9 - x^{12})B) (1 - x^4 + x^3 - x^5 + x^7 - x^8 + x^9 - x^{12})C) (1 + x^3 - x^4 + x^5 + x^8 - x^7 - x^9 - x^{12})D) (1 + x^3 - x^4 + x^5 - x^6 + x^7 - x^8 - x^{12})Comparing my result with the options, it matches option A exactly.

Both polynomials have leading coefficients of 1. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that when two graphs intersect, their y-values are equal at those points. So, if I set the two polynomials equal to each other, the solutions to that equation will give me the x-coordinates of the intersection points. That makes sense.So, let's denote the fourth degree polynomial as ( p(x) ) and the fifth degree polynomial as ( q(x) ). The equation we need to solve is:[ p(x) = q(x) ]Which can be rewritten as:[ p(x) - q(x) = 0 ]Now, ( p(x) ) is a fourth degree polynomial, so it looks something like ( x^4 + text{lower degree terms} ). Similarly, ( q(x) ) is a fifth degree polynomial, so it looks like ( x^5 + text{lower degree terms} ). Both have leading coefficients of 1, so that's straightforward.When I subtract ( q(x) ) from ( p(x) ), I get another polynomial. Let's call this polynomial ( r(x) ):[ r(x) = p(x) - q(x) ]Since ( p(x) ) is degree 4 and ( q(x) ) is degree 5, the highest degree term in ( r(x) ) will come from ( q(x) ) because 5 is higher than 4. Specifically, the leading term of ( r(x) ) will be ( -x^5 ) because ( q(x) ) has a leading term of ( x^5 ) and we're subtracting it.So, ( r(x) ) is a fifth degree polynomial. Now, I remember that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that a polynomial of degree ( n ) can have at most ( n ) real roots. That means ( r(x) ), being a fifth degree polynomial, can have up to 5 real roots.Each real root of ( r(x) ) corresponds to an x-coordinate where ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) intersect. Therefore, the maximum number of intersection points is 5.Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any reason why ( r(x) ) couldn't have 5 real roots? Well, it depends on the specific polynomials, but the question is asking for the maximum number. So, theoretically, it's possible for ( r(x) ) to have 5 real roots, which would mean 5 intersection points.Let me think about an example. Suppose ( p(x) = x^4 ) and ( q(x) = x^5 ). Then, ( r(x) = x^4 - x^5 = x^4(1 - x) ). This equation has roots at ( x = 0 ) (with multiplicity 4) and ( x = 1 ). So, in this case, there are only 2 distinct real roots, but one of them is a repeated root. But that's just one example.If I choose different polynomials, maybe I can get more intersection points. For instance, if ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) are constructed in such a way that ( r(x) ) has 5 distinct real roots, then there would be 5 intersection points.So, it seems like the maximum number is indeed 5. I don't think it can be higher because ( r(x) ) is a fifth degree polynomial, and that's the upper limit according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.Therefore, the answer should be 5, which corresponds to option C."},{"question":"(1+2sqrt {x})^{n}'s expansion, the sum of the coefficients of each term is 243. Given x^{2n}=a_{0}+a_{1}(x+1)+a_{2}(x+1)^{2}+ldots +a_{2n}(x+1)^{2n}, then a_{3}=A: 120B: -120C: 45D: -45","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about expanding expressions and finding coefficients. Let me try to figure it out step by step.First, the problem says: \\"In the expansion of (1 + 2‚àöx)^n, the sum of the coefficients of each term is 243.\\" Hmm, I remember that to find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute x = 1. So, if I plug in x = 1 into (1 + 2‚àöx)^n, it should give me the sum of the coefficients. Let me write that down:Sum of coefficients = (1 + 2‚àö1)^n = (1 + 2)^n = 3^n.And this is equal to 243. So, 3^n = 243. I need to find n. Let me recall that 3^5 = 243 because 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243. So, n must be 5. Got it, n = 5.Now, the next part of the problem says: \\"Given x^{2n} = a_0 + a_1(x + 1) + a_2(x + 1)^2 + ... + a_{2n}(x + 1)^{2n}, then a_3 = ?\\"Alright, so x^{2n} is equal to a polynomial in terms of (x + 1). Since n = 5, x^{2n} is x^{10}. So, x^{10} is expressed as a combination of (x + 1) raised to different powers, from 0 up to 10, with coefficients a_0 to a_{10}.I need to find a_3, which is the coefficient of (x + 1)^3 in this expansion. Hmm, how do I approach this? Maybe I can use the binomial theorem or some substitution.Wait, x^{10} is equal to [ (x + 1) - 1 ]^{10}. Because (x + 1) - 1 = x, so [ (x + 1) - 1 ]^{10} = x^{10}. That seems useful. So, I can write x^{10} as [ (x + 1) - 1 ]^{10} and then expand it using the binomial theorem.Yes, that makes sense. So, expanding [ (x + 1) - 1 ]^{10} using the binomial theorem:[ (x + 1) - 1 ]^{10} = Œ£_{k=0}^{10} C(10, k) * (x + 1)^k * (-1)^{10 - k}.So, this expansion will give me x^{10} as a sum of terms involving (x + 1)^k multiplied by coefficients C(10, k) * (-1)^{10 - k}.But in the problem, x^{10} is expressed as a sum of a_0 + a_1(x + 1) + a_2(x + 1)^2 + ... + a_{10}(x + 1)^{10}. So, the coefficients a_k in the problem correspond to the coefficients in this binomial expansion.Therefore, a_k = C(10, k) * (-1)^{10 - k}.So, to find a_3, I need to compute C(10, 3) * (-1)^{10 - 3}.Let me compute that:First, C(10, 3) is the combination of 10 things taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!).So, C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120.Okay, so C(10, 3) is 120.Next, (-1)^{10 - 3} = (-1)^7 = -1.So, a_3 = 120 * (-1) = -120.Therefore, the value of a_3 is -120.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Sum of coefficients in (1 + 2‚àöx)^n is 243. Substituted x = 1, got 3^n = 243, so n = 5. That seems correct.2. Expressed x^{10} as [ (x + 1) - 1 ]^{10} and expanded using binomial theorem. That seems like a standard technique to express a polynomial in terms of shifted variables.3. Calculated a_3 as C(10, 3) * (-1)^7 = 120 * (-1) = -120. The combination calculation is correct, and the exponent on -1 is correct because 10 - 3 = 7, which is odd, so it's negative.Yes, everything checks out. So, I think the answer is -120.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Let (c) and (d) be real numbers. Consider the following five statements:1. (frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d})2. (c^2 < d^2)3. (c > d)4. (c > 0)5. (d > 0)What is the maximum number of these statements that can be true for any values of (c) and (d)?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the maximum number of these five statements that can be true at the same time for some real numbers ( c ) and ( d ). Let me try to understand each statement and see how they relate to each other.First, let's list out the statements again:1. ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} )2. ( c^2 < d^2 )3. ( c > d )4. ( c > 0 )5. ( d > 0 )Okay, so I need to find values of ( c ) and ( d ) such that as many of these statements as possible are true. Let me analyze each statement and see how they can be true or false based on different scenarios.Starting with statement 4 and 5: ( c > 0 ) and ( d > 0 ). These are straightforward. If both ( c ) and ( d ) are positive, then these are true. If either is negative, then the corresponding statement is false. So, if I can have both ( c ) and ( d ) positive, that would make statements 4 and 5 true. That's a good starting point.Now, statement 3: ( c > d ). If ( c ) is greater than ( d ), then this is true. But if ( c ) is less than or equal to ( d ), it's false. So, if I set ( c ) to be greater than ( d ), statement 3 is true.Statement 2: ( c^2 < d^2 ). This means that the square of ( c ) is less than the square of ( d ). So, if ( |c| < |d| ), then this is true. But if ( |c| geq |d| ), it's false. So, if ( c ) is greater than ( d ), but both are positive, then ( c^2 ) would be greater than ( d^2 ), making statement 2 false. Hmm, that's interesting. So, if I have ( c > d > 0 ), then statement 2 is false.Statement 1: ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ). This is equivalent to ( frac{1}{c} - frac{1}{d} > 0 ), which simplifies to ( frac{d - c}{cd} > 0 ). Since ( c ) and ( d ) are both positive (from statements 4 and 5), the denominator ( cd ) is positive. Therefore, the sign of the expression depends on ( d - c ). If ( d > c ), then ( d - c > 0 ), making the whole expression positive. If ( d < c ), then ( d - c < 0 ), making the expression negative.Wait a minute, so if ( c > d ), then ( frac{1}{c} < frac{1}{d} ), which would make statement 1 false. Conversely, if ( c < d ), then ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ), making statement 1 true. But if I have ( c > d ), statement 3 is true, but statement 1 is false. If I have ( c < d ), statement 3 is false, but statement 1 is true.So, it seems like statements 1 and 3 are inversely related when ( c ) and ( d ) are positive. If one is true, the other is false. Therefore, I can't have both statements 1 and 3 true at the same time if ( c ) and ( d ) are positive.Now, considering statement 2 again: ( c^2 < d^2 ). If ( c ) and ( d ) are positive, this would mean ( c < d ). But if ( c ) and ( d ) have different signs, the comparison changes. For example, if ( c ) is positive and ( d ) is negative, ( c^2 ) could be less than ( d^2 ) if ( c ) is small enough. Similarly, if both are negative, the comparison depends on their absolute values.But since statements 4 and 5 are about ( c ) and ( d ) being positive, I should consider the case where both are positive first. If both are positive, then statement 2 being true would require ( c < d ). But if ( c < d ), then statement 3 is false, and statement 1 is true. So, in this scenario, statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 could be true, but statement 3 would be false.Wait, let me check that. If both ( c ) and ( d ) are positive, and ( c < d ), then:- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) is true.- Statement 2: ( c^2 < d^2 ) is true.- Statement 3: ( c > d ) is false.- Statement 4: ( c > 0 ) is true.- Statement 5: ( d > 0 ) is true.So, in this case, statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are true, which is four statements. That's more than the previous case where I had three statements true.But wait, earlier I thought that if ( c > d > 0 ), then statements 3, 4, and 5 are true, but statement 2 is false. So, in that case, only three statements are true.So, if I choose ( c < d > 0 ), I can have four statements true: 1, 2, 4, and 5. That seems better.But let me think again. If ( c ) and ( d ) are both positive, and ( c < d ), then:- ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) is true because ( c < d ).- ( c^2 < d^2 ) is true because ( c < d ).- ( c > d ) is false.- ( c > 0 ) is true.- ( d > 0 ) is true.So, yes, four statements are true. That's better than the previous case.But wait, can I have all five statements true? Let's see.If I want all five statements to be true, then:1. ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} )2. ( c^2 < d^2 )3. ( c > d )4. ( c > 0 )5. ( d > 0 )But as I saw earlier, if ( c > d > 0 ), then statement 1 is false because ( frac{1}{c} < frac{1}{d} ). So, statement 1 would be false.Alternatively, if ( c < d > 0 ), then statement 3 is false because ( c < d ). So, statement 3 would be false.Therefore, it's impossible to have both statements 1 and 3 true at the same time if ( c ) and ( d ) are positive. So, all five statements cannot be true simultaneously.Wait, but what if ( c ) and ( d ) are not both positive? Let's explore that.Suppose ( c ) is positive and ( d ) is negative. Then:- Statement 4: ( c > 0 ) is true.- Statement 5: ( d > 0 ) is false.- Statement 3: ( c > d ) is true because ( c ) is positive and ( d ) is negative.- Statement 2: ( c^2 < d^2 ) depends on the magnitudes. If ( c ) is smaller in magnitude than ( d ), then ( c^2 < d^2 ) is true.- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ). Since ( d ) is negative, ( frac{1}{d} ) is negative, and ( frac{1}{c} ) is positive. So, ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) is always true because positive is greater than negative.So, in this case, if ( c ) is positive, ( d ) is negative, ( c > d ), and ( c^2 < d^2 ), then:- Statement 1: True- Statement 2: True- Statement 3: True- Statement 4: True- Statement 5: FalseSo, four statements are true. That's the same as the previous case where both were positive.Alternatively, if ( c ) is negative and ( d ) is positive:- Statement 4: ( c > 0 ) is false.- Statement 5: ( d > 0 ) is true.- Statement 3: ( c > d ) is false because ( c ) is negative and ( d ) is positive.- Statement 2: ( c^2 < d^2 ) depends on magnitudes. If ( |c| < d ), then ( c^2 < d^2 ) is true.- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ). Since ( c ) is negative and ( d ) is positive, ( frac{1}{c} ) is negative and ( frac{1}{d} ) is positive. So, ( frac{1}{c} < frac{1}{d} ), making statement 1 false.So, in this case, only statements 2 and 5 are true, which is worse.What if both ( c ) and ( d ) are negative?- Statement 4: ( c > 0 ) is false.- Statement 5: ( d > 0 ) is false.- Statement 3: ( c > d ) depends on their values. If ( c ) is to the right of ( d ) on the number line, ( c > d ) is true.- Statement 2: ( c^2 < d^2 ) depends on their magnitudes. If ( |c| < |d| ), then ( c^2 < d^2 ) is true.- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ). Since both are negative, ( frac{1}{c} ) and ( frac{1}{d} ) are negative. So, ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) would mean that ( frac{1}{c} ) is less negative than ( frac{1}{d} ), which happens when ( |c| > |d| ).So, if both are negative, and ( c > d ) (meaning ( c ) is less negative than ( d )), then:- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) is true because ( |c| < |d| ), so ( frac{1}{c} ) is less negative.- Statement 2: ( c^2 < d^2 ) is true because ( |c| < |d| ).- Statement 3: ( c > d ) is true.- Statement 4: ( c > 0 ) is false.- Statement 5: ( d > 0 ) is false.So, in this case, statements 1, 2, and 3 are true, while 4 and 5 are false. That's three statements, which is less than the four we had earlier.So, from all these scenarios, the maximum number of statements that can be true is four, either when both ( c ) and ( d ) are positive with ( c < d ), or when ( c ) is positive and ( d ) is negative with ( c > d ) and ( c^2 < d^2 ).Wait, let me double-check the case where ( c ) is positive and ( d ) is negative. If ( c > d ) and ( c^2 < d^2 ), then:- ( c ) is positive, ( d ) is negative.- ( c > d ) is true.- ( c^2 < d^2 ) implies ( |c| < |d| ).- ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) is true because ( frac{1}{c} ) is positive and ( frac{1}{d} ) is negative.- ( c > 0 ) is true.- ( d > 0 ) is false.So, statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are true, which is four statements.Similarly, if both are positive and ( c < d ), then:- ( c < d ) implies ( c > d ) is false, but ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) is true.- ( c^2 < d^2 ) is true.- ( c > 0 ) and ( d > 0 ) are true.So, statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are true, which is also four statements.Therefore, the maximum number of statements that can be true is four.Wait, but earlier I thought that if both are positive and ( c < d ), then statement 3 is false, but statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are true. That's four statements.Similarly, if ( c ) is positive and ( d ) is negative with ( c > d ) and ( c^2 < d^2 ), then statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are true, which is also four.So, in both cases, four statements can be true. Is there a way to make five statements true?As I thought earlier, if both are positive, then statements 1 and 3 cannot both be true because ( c > d ) would make statement 1 false, and ( c < d ) would make statement 3 false. Similarly, if one is positive and the other is negative, statements 4 and 5 can't both be true unless both are positive or both are negative. But if both are negative, then statements 4 and 5 are false, so we can't have five statements true.Therefore, the maximum number of statements that can be true is four.Wait, but let me think again. If I set ( c = 1 ) and ( d = 2 ), both positive:- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{1} = 1 > frac{1}{2} = 0.5 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 2: ( 1^2 = 1 < 2^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 3: ( 1 < 2 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 4: ( 1 > 0 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 5: ( 2 > 0 ) ‚Üí TrueSo, statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are true. That's four.Alternatively, if I set ( c = 1 ) and ( d = -2 ):- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{1} = 1 > frac{1}{-2} = -0.5 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 2: ( 1^2 = 1 < (-2)^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 3: ( 1 > -2 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 4: ( 1 > 0 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 5: ( -2 > 0 ) ‚Üí FalseSo, statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are true. That's four.Is there a way to make five statements true? Let's see.Suppose ( c = 2 ) and ( d = 1 ):- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{2} = 0.5 < frac{1}{1} = 1 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 2: ( 2^2 = 4 > 1^2 = 1 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 3: ( 2 > 1 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 4: ( 2 > 0 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 5: ( 1 > 0 ) ‚Üí TrueSo, only statements 3, 4, and 5 are true. That's three.Alternatively, if ( c = -1 ) and ( d = -2 ):- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{-1} = -1 > frac{1}{-2} = -0.5 ) ‚Üí False because -1 < -0.5- Statement 2: ( (-1)^2 = 1 < (-2)^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 3: ( -1 > -2 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 4: ( -1 > 0 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 5: ( -2 > 0 ) ‚Üí FalseSo, statements 2 and 3 are true. That's two.Wait, but earlier I thought that if both are negative, and ( c > d ), then statement 1 is true because ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) when ( |c| < |d| ). Let me check with ( c = -1 ) and ( d = -2 ):- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{-1} = -1 > frac{1}{-2} = -0.5 ) ‚Üí Is -1 > -0.5? No, because -1 is to the left of -0.5 on the number line. So, statement 1 is false.Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me recast it.If both ( c ) and ( d ) are negative, and ( c > d ) (meaning ( c ) is less negative than ( d )), then ( |c| < |d| ). Therefore, ( frac{1}{c} ) is greater than ( frac{1}{d} ) because ( frac{1}{c} ) is less negative than ( frac{1}{d} ). Wait, no, because both are negative, so ( frac{1}{c} ) is greater than ( frac{1}{d} ) if ( |c| < |d| ). For example, ( c = -1 ), ( d = -2 ):- ( frac{1}{c} = -1 )- ( frac{1}{d} = -0.5 )- Is -1 > -0.5? No, because -1 is less than -0.5.Wait, so actually, ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) when both are negative would require ( |c| < |d| ), but since both are negative, ( frac{1}{c} ) is greater than ( frac{1}{d} ) if ( |c| < |d| ). But in reality, ( frac{1}{c} ) is less than ( frac{1}{d} ) because ( c ) is closer to zero than ( d ), making ( frac{1}{c} ) more negative than ( frac{1}{d} ).Wait, no, let's think carefully. If ( c = -1 ) and ( d = -2 ):- ( frac{1}{c} = -1 )- ( frac{1}{d} = -0.5 )- So, ( frac{1}{c} = -1 ) is less than ( frac{1}{d} = -0.5 ), because -1 is to the left of -0.5 on the number line.Therefore, ( frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{d} ) would be false in this case.Wait, so my earlier conclusion was wrong. If both ( c ) and ( d ) are negative, and ( c > d ) (i.e., ( c ) is less negative), then ( |c| < |d| ), and ( frac{1}{c} ) is greater than ( frac{1}{d} ) only if ( c ) and ( d ) are positive. If they are negative, ( frac{1}{c} ) is less than ( frac{1}{d} ) because ( frac{1}{c} ) is more negative.Therefore, in the case where both are negative, statement 1 is false.So, going back, if both are negative, and ( c > d ), then:- Statement 1: False- Statement 2: True (if ( |c| < |d| ))- Statement 3: True- Statement 4: False- Statement 5: FalseSo, only statements 2 and 3 are true. That's two.Therefore, the maximum number of statements that can be true is four, either when both are positive with ( c < d ), or when ( c ) is positive and ( d ) is negative with ( c > d ) and ( c^2 < d^2 ).Wait, but in the case where ( c ) is positive and ( d ) is negative, and ( c > d ) and ( c^2 < d^2 ), then:- Statement 1: True- Statement 2: True- Statement 3: True- Statement 4: True- Statement 5: FalseSo, four statements are true.Similarly, when both are positive and ( c < d ):- Statement 1: True- Statement 2: True- Statement 3: False- Statement 4: True- Statement 5: TrueSo, four statements are true.Therefore, the maximum number of statements that can be true is four.But wait, let me check if there's a case where five statements can be true.Suppose ( c = 0 ) and ( d = 1 ):- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{0} ) is undefined, so statement 1 is false.- Statement 2: ( 0^2 = 0 < 1^2 = 1 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 3: ( 0 < 1 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 4: ( 0 > 0 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 5: ( 1 > 0 ) ‚Üí TrueSo, only statements 2 and 5 are true. That's two.Alternatively, if ( c = 0 ) and ( d = -1 ):- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{0} ) is undefined ‚Üí False- Statement 2: ( 0^2 = 0 < (-1)^2 = 1 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 3: ( 0 > -1 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 4: ( 0 > 0 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 5: ( -1 > 0 ) ‚Üí FalseSo, statements 2 and 3 are true. That's two.Therefore, setting ( c = 0 ) doesn't help in getting more statements true.What about if ( c ) and ( d ) are both zero?- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{0} ) is undefined ‚Üí False- Statement 2: ( 0^2 = 0 < 0^2 = 0 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 3: ( 0 > 0 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 4: ( 0 > 0 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 5: ( 0 > 0 ) ‚Üí FalseSo, all statements are false. That's worse.Therefore, the maximum number of statements that can be true is four.Wait, but let me think again. If I set ( c = 1 ) and ( d = -1 ):- Statement 1: ( frac{1}{1} = 1 > frac{1}{-1} = -1 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 2: ( 1^2 = 1 < (-1)^2 = 1 ) ‚Üí False- Statement 3: ( 1 > -1 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 4: ( 1 > 0 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 5: ( -1 > 0 ) ‚Üí FalseSo, statements 1, 3, and 4 are true. That's three.Alternatively, if ( c = 1 ) and ( d = -2 ):- Statement 1: ( 1 > -0.5 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 2: ( 1 < 4 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 3: ( 1 > -2 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 4: ( 1 > 0 ) ‚Üí True- Statement 5: ( -2 > 0 ) ‚Üí FalseSo, four statements are true.Therefore, the maximum number of statements that can be true is four.I think I've considered all possible scenarios, and in none of them can all five statements be true. The maximum is four."},{"question":"if ( 18 ^ a ) * 9 ^ ( 3 a ‚Äì 1 ) = ( 2 ^ 7 ) ( 3 ^ b ) and a and b are positive integers , what is the value of a ?","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation here: (18^a) * (9^(3a ‚Äì 1)) = (2^7) * (3^b), and I need to find the value of 'a' where both 'a' and 'b' are positive integers. Hmm, let's see. I think I should start by breaking down the numbers 18 and 9 into their prime factors because that might help me simplify the equation.Alright, 18 can be expressed as 2 multiplied by 3 squared, right? So, 18 = 2 * 3^2. And 9 is just 3 squared, so 9 = 3^2. Okay, so I can rewrite the original equation using these prime factors. Let me try that.So, substituting these into the equation, I get: (2 * 3^2)^a * (3^2)^(3a ‚Äì 1) = 2^7 * 3^b. Now, I need to simplify the left side of the equation. I remember that when you raise a product to a power, you can distribute the exponent to each factor. So, (2 * 3^2)^a becomes 2^a * (3^2)^a, which is 2^a * 3^(2a). Got that part.Next, I have (3^2)^(3a ‚Äì 1). Using the power of a power rule, that becomes 3^(2*(3a ‚Äì 1)), which simplifies to 3^(6a ‚Äì 2). Okay, so now the left side of the equation is 2^a * 3^(2a) * 3^(6a ‚Äì 2). I can combine the exponents of the same base. For the base 3, I add the exponents: 2a + 6a ‚Äì 2, which equals 8a ‚Äì 2. So, the left side simplifies to 2^a * 3^(8a ‚Äì 2).Now, the equation looks like this: 2^a * 3^(8a ‚Äì 2) = 2^7 * 3^b. Since the bases are the same on both sides, I can set the exponents equal to each other. For the base 2, the exponent on the left is 'a' and on the right is 7, so a must equal 7. For the base 3, the exponent on the left is 8a ‚Äì 2 and on the right is b, so 8a ‚Äì 2 equals b. But since the question only asks for 'a', I don't need to find 'b'.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I broke down 18 and 9 into their prime factors correctly. Then I applied the power rules correctly to each term. Combining the exponents for base 3 seems right, and setting the exponents equal because the bases are the same makes sense. Yeah, I think that's correct.
